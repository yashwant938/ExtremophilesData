"water","D014867",32533304,7347518," While many studies have investigated microorganisms in the air and dust, tap water, another major input of microbial propagules, has received far less attention.;  The quality of drinking water in developed world is strictly regulated to prevent immediate danger to human health.;  These organisms can thus use water as a vector of transmission into the households, especially if they are resistant to various water treatment procedures.;  Limitation of water availability, high or low temperatures, application of antimicrobial chemicals and other measures are taken to prevent indoor microbial overgrowth.;  As a result, microorganisms that often enter our households with water and are then enriched in novel indoor habitats might have a hitherto underestimated impact on the well-being of the increasingly indoor-bound human population.;  Clean and safe water is an indispensable resource that is becoming increasingly scarce as the world population is growing, consumption as well as pollution is going up, urbanisation is spreading and mega cities became the new ecological reality.; Microorganisms enter buildings with outdoor air, soil, water, living plants and different food products as well as other humans and pets (Weikl et al. 2016; Jayaprakash et al. 2017; Shan et al. 2019; Cooper 2010).;  Comparatively little has been published on microbes in domestic water sources or in wet or humid domestic environments such as kitchens, bathrooms and domestic appliances, containing or operating with water.;  Indoor water-borne microorganisms are not confined only to bathrooms and kitchens but can also populate tap water systems and household appliances, in which they can be attracted to certain chemicals and plastic or rubber surfaces.; Research on water-related indoor microorganisms so far mostly focused on bacteria important for human health (Larsen et al. 2010).;  The diversity of these fungal “water-biomes” turned out to be dominated by polyextremotolerant, oligotrophic species, some of which are opportunistic human pathogens, representing a potential health problem that became widely recognised only in the last years (Zalar et al. 2011; Hamada and Abe 2010; Lian and de Hoog 2010; Defra 2011; Fouquier et al. 2016).; Before being suitable for water consumption, raw water originating from either surface water or groundwater is subjected to a variety of physico-chemical treatments in order to remove larger particles and microorganisms.;  The efficiency of removing microbes from raw water greatly depends on the combination of the cleaning techniques used and may vary between 8 and 99.99% (WHO 2011).;  Water for human consumption should not contain potentially harmful microorganisms or dangerous substances, making it necessary to control not only the input water quality, but also the formation of biofilms and increases of the microbial load in the distribution system.;  Since WHO follows microbiological trends and health problems on a global level, they list a large spectrum of microbial genera that are important for monitoring water quality and thus ensuring public health (WHO 2011).;  The mandatory microbiological parameters used for the determination of water quality in the EU are the presence of the bacteria Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, coliforms and the total number of detectable aerobic microorganisms after incubation at 22 °C and 37 °C (EEC 1998).;  Enteric viruses and occurrence of oocysts and cysts belonging to the protozoa Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium spp. and Entamoeba hystolitica can also be used as additional indicators of water quality, recommended by WHO (WHO 2011).; Despite routine monitoring of several microbial parameters in water, these often do not cover spore-forming microorganisms and microbes aggregating in clumps.;  This can be seen as problematic, since such microorganisms are typically more resistant to the water treatment process and enter households via plumbing systems, where they are the cause of significant problems related to accumulation of biofilms and corrosion of materials.;  If present in large quantities, they also change the odour of water and may affect human health via toxin production (Novak Babič et al. 2017a, b).;  Due to the need for light, algae can be found in the upper layers of natural water sources, particularly in lakes and rivers with low water flow (Wurzbacher et al. 2011).;  Some algal species belonging to the genera Scenedesmus, Euglena, Anacystis, Coelastrum, Prototheca and Chlorococcum can be found in tap water systems, despite chlorination, and can survive without light (Defra 2011).;  Algae in tap water systems are particularly problematic as reservoirs of certain bacteria (e.g.;  According to the WHO, algae producing toxins, and those causing bad taste or odour, should be absent from tap water (WHO 2011).;  Species that can form oocysts represent particular problems, since they are less sensitive to water chlorination (Valster 2011).;  According to the WHO Acanthamoeba spp., Cryptosporidium hominis, C. parvum, Cyclospora cayetanensis, E. histolytica, Giardia intestinalis and Naegleria fowleri should be absent from water.; The least investigated group of eukaryotes with poorly understood roles in the water microbiome are fungi.;  Biofilms in tap water systems may contain up to 8.9 CFU/cm2 of yeasts and 4.0–25.2 CFU/cm2 of filamentous fungi (Doggett 2000).;  A great variety of fungi was detected in drinking water either by culture-dependent or molecular methods (e.g. with metagenome of amplicon sequencing).;  Their diversity significantly depends on the source of raw water (Moat et al. 2016; Novak Babič et al. 2017a, b).;  Water from surface water sources is dominated by plant-degrading fungi of the genera Acremonium, Altenaria, Arthrinium, Aspergillus, Beauveria, Botrytis, Cladosporium, Cryptococcus, Epicoccum, Fusarium, Geotrichum, Gliocladium, Mucor, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, Phoma, Rhizopus, Rhodotorula, Sporothrix and Trichoderma.;  Yeasts Candida spp., Cystobasidium spp. and black yeast-like fungi Aureobasidium, Cladophialophora, Cyphellophora, Exophiala, Phialophora and Rhinocladiella are more often found in water originating from the groundwater (Novak Babič et al. 2017a, b).;  Due to the lack of information linking clinical infections and the fungal presence in drinking water, fungi are not yet considered an independent parameter in water regulations.;  However, their presence in drinking water can alter the taste and odour of water, while in higher numbers they can impair human health causing allergies, asthma and superficial infections of hair, skin and nails (Defra 2011; Novak Babič et al. 2017a, b).; Bacteria are the most numerous microorganisms in tap water and biofilms of the water distribution system.;  In inappropriately treated water sources, after natural disasters or due to faults in water supply systems, the number of pathogenic bacteria involved in infections of the digestive and respiratory tract can exceed the prescribed safe limits (Percival et al. 2014).;  The most problematic bacteria potentially found in tap water according to WHO are Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhi, Shigella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, E. coli, Yersinia enterolitica, Legionella spp., Aeromonas spp., Mycobacterium spp., Bacillus spp. and P. aeruginosa (WHO 2011; EEC 1998).;  However, the presence, diversity and ecological interactions of water-borne bacteria remain poorly investigated and understood.;  The number of bacteria reaches its lowest limits in water tanks after treatment procedures (e.g. chlorination), while in tap water the number of bacteria increases again due to the presence of biofilms in plumbing systems (Kormas et al. 2010).;  Thus, the numbers of CFU in groundwater can be up to 106 CFU/mL, in well water up to 103 CFU/mL, in reservoir tanks after chlorination up to 102 CFU/mL and in household tap water between 102 and 105 CFU/mL (Kormas et al. 2010; Callewaert et al. 2015).;  Typical bacteria in ground and well water are Betaproteobacteria (Kormas et al. 2010).;  The same class is usually also dominant in cold water in the indoor plumbing system (Inkinen et al. 2016).;  In biofilms of the lower parts of the plumbing system (e.g. basement and first floor), in systems with regular water consumption and relatively high water flow, Alphaproteobacteria dominate over Betaproteobacteria (Inkinen et al. 2016).;  This is also true in copper pipes (Inkinen et al. 2016), while cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) pipes in combination with hot water appear to select for Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacilli (Callewaert et al. 2015; Inkinen et al. 2016; Moat et al. 2016).; Microorganisms entering buildings via tap water become exposed to different physico-chemical factors, which shape the diversity of the communities in indoor habitats.;  Not only because water availability is often not constant (occasional desiccation triggers high levels of stress), but also due to other conditions.;  Showerheads, with their abundance of water, represent a challenge to microbes due to mechanical forces and water chlorination, two factors that presumably select for biofilm-forming species (Feazel et al. 2009) (Fig. ​(Fig.1).1).;  Biofilm formation, oligotrophicity, resistance to water treatment procedures, resistance to occasional desiccation and cleaning procedures are among traits promoting survival of water-related microbes indoors.;  Tap water distribution systems provide opportunities for microbial growth of adapted microorganisms.;  After entering the household with water, different habitats support the formation of many, in some cases very specific communities, shaped by the conditions of each habitat (such as shower heads or household appliances).;  In some cases, the enriched microorganisms leave the household in large numbers (e.g. with wastewater), possibly contaminating water sources and re-entering the households at a later time;  Opportunistic fungal pathogens are present also in residential buildings, where habitats with regular presence of liquid water (e.g. plumbing, sinks or drains) support active growth and accumulation of high biomass, while dry surfaces contain mostly species deposited from air and aerosols (Adams et al. 2013; Zalar et al. 2011).;  Exposure to microbes comes from handling and preparing food and from contact with kitchen surfaces that harbour microorganisms derived from food, water, air and humans (Medrano-Felix et al. 2011).;  Although outdoor and indoor air and water are known sources of microbial contamination of kitchens, human skin was found to be the primary source of bacteria belonging to the families Propionibacteriaceae, Corynebacteriaceae, Staphylococcaceae and Streptococcaceae (Flores et al. 2011; Flores et al. 2012).;  Diversity of bacterial communities of typical household kitchens was studied in detail only recently and it revealed that moist surfaces in kitchens usually yield the highest number of microbes due to the presence of water essential for microbial propagation (Sinclair and Gerba 2011; Flores et al. 2012).;  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) also revealed the presence of water-borne bacteria Acinetobacter johnsonii, A. pittii, A. ursingii, Chryseobacterium hominis and Moraxella osloensis belonging to the Biosafety Level 2 along with known biofilm producers of the genera Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas and Rhizobium (Table ​(Table1)1) (Cardinale et al. 2017).; The most common bacterial and fungal species reported from different water-related indoor habitats;  Recently, conducted studies suggested tap water as an important additional vector (Novak Babič et al. 2016b).;  Ubiquitous genera of filamentous fungi like Aspergillus, Cladosporium and Penicillium were present mainly on surfaces exposed to outdoor air (e.g. sills next to windows) (Adams et al. 2013), while moist surfaces in regular contact with water harboured yeasts from the genera Apiotrichum, Candida, Cryptococcus, Cystobasidium, Issatchenkia, Malassezia, Meyerozyma, Naganishia, Hyphopichia, Pichia, Rhodotorula, Trichosporon, Wickerhamiella and Wickerhamomyces, and black yeasts Aureobasidium, Capronia, Cyphellophora, Cladophialophora, Exophiala, Fonsecaea, Knufia, Phialophora and Rhinocladiella (Table ​(Table1)1) (Zupančič et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2018), many of which were previously reported also from tap water (Zupančič et al. 2016; Novak Babič et al. 2016b).; Isolation plates with fungi from different indoor habitats linked to water. a Filter paper covered with colonies of Aureobasidium melanogenum and Aspergillus spp. isolated from 1 l of drinking water on Dichloran Rose Bengal Agar with addition of chloramphenicol (DRBC+Ch). bFusarium oxysporum species complex (FOSC) isolated on Malt Extract Agar with addition of chloramphenicol (MEA+Ch).;  The major ones are tap water, human skin and oral biota, and faecal contamination (in case of coliform bacteria) (Ankola et al. 2009).;  Water-related bacteria are colonising interiors of water pipes and shower hoses and belong mainly to Alphaproteobacteria followed by Actinobacteria (Moat et al. 2016).; Similarly to bacteria, fungi colonising bathroom surfaces can also originate from tap water or skin.;  In the following studies, results confirmed the existence of a core mycobiota (Zupančič et al. 2016) and identified tap water as the main source of contamination of dishwashers with these fungi (Novak Babič et al. 2016b).;  It was confirmed that fungi from dishwashers can be present in hot aerosols, released immediately at the end of the washing cycle and in wastewater drained from the dishwashers (Zupančič et al. 2016).;  To evaluate water as the possible vector of contamination of dishwashers with bacteria, a metagenomic analysis of bacterial diversity in tap water was conducted.;  The study showed the dominance of Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria in the water, while Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were present in much lower numbers.;  Additionally, differences in temperature inside appliances result in condensate formation and thus a relatively constant source of water, while parts made of plastic and rubber facilitate microbial attachment and biofilm formation.;  Opportunistic pathogenic fungi belonging to the black yeasts Cyphellophora, Exophiala, Knufia, Rhinocladiella and Ochroconis were commonly isolated, in particular from rubber surfaces (Wang et al. 2018) and were additionally found, along with the genera Acremonium, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Candida, Cladosporium and Scopulariopsis on interior plastic parts and refrigerator ice and water dispensers (Table ​(Table1)1) (Fig. ​(Fig.2)2) (Altunatmaz et al. 2012).;  Thus, washing at low temperatures only reduces the number of live bacteria, both in water and on dirty clothes.;  Their diversity varied depending on the water type and skin microbiota of the users (Callewaert et al. 2015).;  However, their presence in washing machines causes persistent unpleasant odour due to bacterial degradation of detergents and other organic matter present on clothes and in the water and they are released into waste greywater, which exits the washing machines (Munk et al. 2001; Stapleton et al. 2013; Callewaert et al. 2015).;  Most fungi isolated from washing machines entered via tap water.; Besides water availability, microbial colonisation is determined by the nutritional substances that can be derived from the building materials or environment (Gorny 2004), the presence of specific chemicals, such as surfactants from soap and shampoo (Hamada and Abe 2010) or from co-occurring microbial species.;  The hot spots of these microorganisms are not so much the surfaces touched and contaminated by humans or animals, but much more the habitats with high availability of liquid water.;  These are also used in products designed to be in prolonged contact with water—water pipes, rubber seals, faucet aerators and many others.;  Bacterial biofilms on stainless steel were reported to be thinner and easier to remove than those found on polyethylene, which contained a higher proportion of viable bacteria—an important consideration when for example choosing the material of a kitchen sink, but also of tap water piping systems, where the formation of biofilms is linked with numerous problems impacting the safety of tap water.; Another widely used material, providing a better surface for microbial attachment, is rubber, which is widely used to seal contacts between components of systems and appliances that need to be water-tight.;  In the investigation of materials used in tap water piping systems, rubber turned out to be by far the most problematic material in terms of biofilm formation (Szczotko et al. 2016).;  After the visible foaming pollution in streams and wastewater treatment plants in the 1940s and 1950s, more degradable compounds were produced and in many regions the use of biodegradable detergents is now obligatory by law.;  Many surfactants degrade even before reaching the wastewater treatment plant (Cowan-Ellsberry et al. 2014; Merrettig-Bruns and Jelen 2009).;  Microorganisms can also grow in the soap water with which we wash them from our skin or objects.;  Fungi that successfully infect a human body have to overcome several obstacles, such as high temperature (Robert and Casadevall 2009), oxidative bursts of human phagocytes and severe iron limitation (Hamad 2008; Kumamoto 2008), and low water activity and low pH in case of skin penetration (Elias 2007).;  Perhaps one of the most obvious examples is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium also tightly connected to habitats with good accessibility of water, such as faucets and drains.;  While some of these traits are known for Candida spp., Fusarium oxysporum (FOSC) and F. solani complexes (FSSC), all of these are characteristic for the black yeast E. dermatitidis, dominant fungus in dishwashers around the world (Zalar et al. 2011; Lavrin et al. 2020), and A. melanogenum prevailing in tap water (Novak Babič et al. 2016b, 2017a).; Polyextremotolerant species use various mechanisms to overcome starvation, both in nature and in oligotrophic indoor water-related environments.;  Greater numbers of susceptible hosts, improved diagnostics and recognition of water-related indoor microbiomes and changes of our lifestyle have all been proposed as reasons for this trend (Casadevall et al. 2011; Gostinčar et al. 2011, 2015).; Good personal hygiene practices, proper hygiene of household surfaces and regular maintenance of household appliances can substantially lower the presence of indoor water-related microorganisms and can prevent most infections (Flores et al. 2012).; Microbiological analyses of water quality are typically limited to certain standard procedures and regulations, which are often outdated even before they are even generally accepted by international and national regulating bodies.;  These can be present in disinfected water, in long-lived biofilms inside the plumbing systems, inside household appliances and on other surfaces, particularly in kitchens and bathrooms.;  Here, microorganisms do not just persist, but may spread further within the household, survive wastewater treatments and return to the environment, potentially creating a microbial vicious circle.; Microorganisms are introduced into domestic appliances via water, air, dishware, food, hands and clothes.;  These biofilms can be established on interior materials due to the constant presence of water, either entering the appliance from the tap water distribution system or condensing on the surface.;  Biofilms contain high concentrations of microbial cells, which can be sporadically released as aerosols into the air or as individual planktonic cells or clumps of cells into the water.; Two modes of adaptation can be recognised in microorganisms inhabiting humid indoor habitats (water, wet cells and household appliances).; The present studies show that water is an important source of exposure to environmental microorganisms in domestic environments and that the selection of water-borne microorganisms during water treatment and upon entering the generally inhospitable indoor environment favours species with a higher virulence potential.;  While the number of studies supporting this observation is steadily increasing, more epidemiological and experimental approaches are needed to further elucidate the role of the domestic water microbiome in human health."
"arsenic","D001151",26733008,4679917," HAAL proved to be a rich source of microbes showing interesting adaptations to life in extreme settings (poly-extremophiles) such as alkalinity, high concentrations of arsenic and dissolved salts, intense dryness, large daily ambient thermal amplitude, and extreme solar radiation levels.;  Current projects heading this way have yielded detailed molecular information and functional proof on novel extremoenzymes: i.e., DNA repair enzymes and arsenic efflux pumps for which medical and bioremediation applications, respectively, are envisaged.; At the lakes themselves, salt contents, pH, and arsenic concentration (Table ​(Table1)1) can reach extreme values, generating niches where extremophilic microorganisms develop.;  The most common oxidation states for soluble arsenic in nature are the pentavalent, arsenate [As(V)], and the trivalent arsenite [As(III)], present as (AsO4−3) and (As(OH)3), respectively, (Rosen, 2002; Anderson and Cook, 2004)—As(III) being much more toxic than As(V) (Mukhopadhyay, 2002; Rosen, 2002; Oremland and Stolz, 2003).;  Even though HAAL are pristine environments, they display a high concentration of arsenic in the water due to natural geochemical phenomena and active volcanism (Flynn et al., 2002; Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002; Mantelli et al., 2003; Romero et al., 2003; Escudero et al., 2007; Dib et al., 2008; Escalante et al., 2009; Ordoñez et al., 2009).;  Endogenous and exogenous agents, such as meteorological effects on the soil, and the circulation of subterranean water and wind, distribute arsenic through the atmosphere, soil and water (Lara et al., 2012).;  Ascotan, arsenic concentrations in brine sediments range between 610 and 9440 mg kg−1 (Escudero et al., 2013).;  Such arsenic accumulation significantly exceeds the maximum amount accepted by the World Health Organization (10 μg L−1) and is also greater than the one reported for Lake Mono (200 μM HAsO4−2, approximately 19.8 mg L−1 As0), a hypersaline and alkaline water body (Oremland et al., 2005) in which indigenous microbes and their interaction with As have been widely studied (Wolfe-Simon et al., 2011; Reaves et al., 2012).;  The water were stromatolites develop is alkaline, hypersaline, rich in inorganic nutrients, very rich in arsenic, and warm (20–24°C) due to a hydrothermal input.;  Partially submerged calcareous formations (microbialites) thrived outstanding chemical hamper including pH up to 11 and poisoning arsenic concentrations (115–234 mg/L).;  The metabolic potential of these biofilms was explored specially for arsenic metabolism; Rascovan et al. (2015) hypothesized that DLRB employ different metabolic strategies in response to environmental changes.;  Using these samples, strain isolation programs were guided toward specific taxonomic groups, microbial resistances or characteristics, such as their remarkable resistance to high salinity, UV-B irradiation, antibiotics (ATBs), oxidative stress and arsenic levels (Fernández Zenoff et al., 2006; Dib et al., 2008, 2009; Farías et al., 2009; Flores et al., 2009; Ordoñez et al., 2009).;  On the other hand, isolated bacteria from HAAL with arsenic resistance phenotypes were described by Dib et al. (2008).;  The majority of these genes are devoted to the resistance of arsenic, chromium, and fluoroquinolones, with 18 genes devoted to multidrug resistance efflux pumps.; Through a proteomic approach, Belfiore et al. (2013) described the proteins involved in the arsenic resistance process of another model extremophile isolated from L.;  The comparative analysis of S17, exposed and unexposed to arsenic—As(V) and As(III)—revealed 25 proteins differentially expressed.;  Under arsenic stress, proteins involved in energy-metabolism, stress, transport, and in protein synthesis were noticeably up-regulated.;  S17 was likewise obtained, emphasizing the fact that it contains a complete DNA repair system, including UvrABC, MutL-MutS, and bacterial photolyase, and several genes related to toxic compound resistance, such as antibiotics, arsenic, cadmium, and mercury (Ordonez et al., 2013).;  Genomic comparisons with available public genomes from Exiguobacterium suggests that one of the reasons behind high resistance to arsenic in S17 is the presence of the acr3 gene, a known contributor to cell detoxification against arsenite, one of the most toxic arsenic species (Ordoñez et al., 2015).; Three novel arsenic resistant strains of Salinivibrio spp. (up to 200 mM As), NaCl (up to 15%), and UV-B radiation (19 kJ/m2) isolated from different niches of L.;  Among many putative systems related with multiple-stress resilience, the three draft genomes displayed genes related with osmotic stress, DNA repair, arsenic detoxification systems, hydrolytic enzymes, ferredoxins, flavodoxins, proteorhodopsins, and xanthorhodopsins.;  However, these have been shown to be consistently extreme all along the whole Puna-Altiplano region, with values as high as a monthly mean UV Index above 19, UV erythemal daily doses above 10 kJ m−2, total solar irradiances close to the solar constant, daily total horizontal insolation of about 6.6 kW h m−2, intense dryness and large daily ambient thermal amplitude, together with the exposure to a multitude of chemicals and physical stresses, including alkalinity, high concentrations of arsenic and dissolved salts, and dust and ashes from volcanic activity.;  Ver3 (Albarracín et al., 2014), and an arsenical resistance efflux pump from Exiguobacterium sp."

"PacC","C406277",37367588,10301932," In both biological models, the PacC transcription factor activates the Pal/Rim pathway through two successive proteolytic mechanisms.;  PacC is a repressor of acid-expressed genes and an activator of alkaline-expressed genes when it is in an active state.; The pH-dependent signaling system involving the transcription factor PacC/Rim101, which is proteolytically activated by the Pal/Rim signaling pathway, is one of the most thoroughly investigated alkali gene-regulating strategies to modulate metabolism in fungi when grown in alkaline conditions.;  PacC/Rim101 transcription factor activation activates genes related to alkaline stress and inhibits genes related to growth in the presence of acidic pH [12]. This review aims to synthesize information regarding alkaliphilic and alkali-tolerant fungi, their adaptation mechanisms, related signaling cascades, and the biotechnological significance of the enzymes that can be produced under this stress.; pH is regulated by a signal transduction pathway that leads to the proteolytic activation of a zinc finger transcription factor called PacC [38,39] (Figure 3).;  PacC72 possesses 674 amino acids [40,41] and undergoes post-translational modifications when extracellular pH is neutral or alkaline.;  PacC72 acquires a closed conformation at acidic pH, which is maintained by the interaction of a C-terminal domain with two upstream domains, thereby preventing proteolytic processing.;  When the pH signal is received, the protein conformation changes to an open state [42]. PacC72 contains a “signaling protease box” that removes roughly 180 C-terminal residues, resulting in ∼495 residues (PacC53) [43]. PacC undergoes a second processing step in which an additional ∼245 C-terminal residue is removed, resulting in the ∼250 residues (PacC27) [40,43,44]. This second proteolysis reaction is pH-independent [43]. PacC27 inhibits acid-expressed genes while activating alkaline-expressed genes [45]. The PacC27 form exposes the DNA-binding domain (DBD) containing three Cys2His2 zinc fingers (core consensus: 5-GCCARG) [45] that is sufficient to drive preferential nuclear localization [46,47]. PacC27 and PacC53, but not PacC72, exhibit marked nuclear localization preference [47]. Finger 1 interacts with finger 2 instead of DNA, whereas residues within fingers 2 and 3 interact with target DNA [41,46,48].; Signal transduction pathway for the activation of the Rim101/PacC transcription factor.; Ascomycota’s Pal/Rim pathway comprises six gene products: Rim21/PalH, Rim8/PalF, Rim20/PalA, Rim13/PalB, Rim23/PalC, and Rim9/PalI [37,38,39,49,50,51]. The products of six genes, palA, palB, palC, palF, palH, and palI, transmit the alkaline extracellular pH signal to PacC [38,39]. Null mutations in any of the six pal genes of the pH signal transduction pathway and in pacC have an acidity-mimicking phenotype [38,39].;  In addition, PalC binds to Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport-III (ESCRT-III) Snf7p/Vps32, indicating a potential role as a link between the upstream and downstream pH signaling complexes [55]. Although multiple studies associate pH signaling proteins with endocytosis, Lucena-Agell et al. (2015) [56] demonstrated by endocytosis block that PacC processing is not significantly affected, indicating that pH signaling proteins probably do not require endocytosis.; pH signal transduction requires that the PalA protein binds to two YPXL/I motifs located at either side of the signaling protease box in PacC72, where Tyr, Pro, and Leu/Ile are crucial for its interactive properties, required for the pH-regulated cleavage of this transcription factor [57]. PalB, a cysteine protease of the calpain family, is probably the signaling protease that causes the first proteolytic processing of PacC72 but not the second proteolytic processing [58].;  The genome of the alkaliphilic fungus Sodiomyces alkalinus was sequenced (BioSample: SAMN02745840) [64], and the UniProt annotation [65] shows that this fungus presents practically all the Pal pathway genes (PalI, PalH, PalF, PalC, PacC)."
"poly","C017937",37317247,10223213," Therefore, extremophilic microorganisms offer enormous opportunities for practical biodegradation processes as they are naturally adapted to multi-stress conditions due to the special structure of their cell wall, capsule, S-layer proteins, extracellular polymer substances (EPS), and siderophores structural and functional properties such as poly-enzymes produced.; Additives used in the textile industry lead to the formation of refractory intermediates which are toxic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and aromatic amines [12,13]. Under highly saline conditions in dye effluents, the degradation of PAH occurs slowly.;  However, many extremophilic bacteria belong to two or more categories and are known as polyextremophiles [33]. Some studies have highlighted the benefits of extremophilic and polyextremophilic microorganisms in biotechnology and bioremediation.;  Biological approaches using polyenzyme-producing extremophiles have shown great efficiency in the degradation of aerobic and anaerobic dyes [35]. Therefore, investigating well-adapted bacterial candidates under multiple stress conditions is a promising strategy for research and application for removing dyes from wastewater.;  The structure of cell wall polymers, which mainly consists of teichuronic acids and teichuronopeptides, also greatly contributes to maintaining pH homeostasis in the cytoplasm via a negatively charged matrix and reduces the pH value at the cell surface of alkaliphilic bacteria [46]. Alkaliphilic bacteria in pure cultures or consortia, such as Bacteroides spp., Eubacterium spp., Clostridium spp., Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus spp., and Sphingomonas are effective azo dye-degrading candidates [38].;  In particular, bacterial peroxidases are preferred to fungal peroxidases because bacteria are more flexible during protein engineering to enhance catalyst activity [102]. Thermosediminibacter spp. have been investigated as promising candidates for the production of peroxidases (DyP), laccases, and azoreductases involved in dye decolorization [103]. Lignocellulosic biomass is currently considered not only an abundant renewable source for the production of biofuels and valuable bioproducts, but also a significant substrate or biosorbent for dye removal because of its eco-friendly nature and natural availability [9]. Lignin is one of three different polymers decomposed from lignocellulose and may be a suitable substrate for extremophilic lignin peroxidase-producing bacteria to enhance LiP production which contributes to the dye degradation process.; Agrowaste is considered an excellent substrate source for polyenzyme production in the fermentation process, eliminating hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin [9,107]. Therefore, multi-enzyme-producing bacteria are potential candidates for various waste decompositions in the polypolluted form.;  However, studying these polyenzyme-producing extremophiles is more challenging because of the lack of knowledge about particular physiological features and molecular properties due to the change in their complex metabolic pathways under extreme environments.;  Additionally, understanding the changes in the metabolic pathways and physiological properties of polyenzyme-producing bacteria under harsh fluctuating environmental conditions may help in the discovery of novel enzymes and their potential functions."

"ice","D007053",31087781,6828557,"Antifreeze proteins and ice-binding proteins have been discovered in a diverse range of extremophiles and have the ability to modulate the growth and formation of ice crystals.;  Considering the importance of cryoscience across transport, biomedicine, and climate science, there is significant interest in developing synthetic macromolecular mimics of antifreeze proteins, in particular to reproduce their property of ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI).;  This activity is a continuum rather than an “on/off” property and there may be multiple molecular mechanisms which give rise to differences in this observable property; the limiting concentrations for ice growth vary by more than a thousand between an antifreeze glycoprotein and poly(vinyl alcohol), for example.;  The link between activity and the mechanisms involving either ice binding or amphiphilicity is discussed and known materials assigned into classes based on this.; Antifreeze, ice-binding and ice-nucleating macromolecules have been discovered in a diverse range of extremophile organisms from fish to insects to plants.;  These are produced to enable the species to survive by promoting freeze-tolerance and freeze-avoidance and have been extensively reviewed.[1–4] The ability to modulate ice formation and growth has vast technological importance across fields such as aerospace,[5] green energy,[6] automotive, and biology, in particular cellular cryopreservation[7–10]; the storage of cells/tissues at subzero temperatures, which underpins many areas of modern biomedicine, clinical medicine, and basic biology.;  Current strategies are based on adding large volumes of (low molecular weight) cryoprotective agents such as glycerol or DMSO which enable slow freezing or vitrification.[11–13] Antifreeze (glyco) proteins, (AF(G)Ps) have been found to improve cryopreservation outcomes, due to their property of ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI; discussed more below),[14–16] but also potentially by stabilizing membranes.[17,18] Considering this, there has been significant recent interest in developing synthetic materials to mimic AF(G)Ps.;  AF(G)Ps have three main properties resulting from their ice interactions; non-colligative depression of the freezing point (thermal hysteresis (TH)), dynamic ice shaping (DIS); IRI activity.;  The latter (IRI) is of particular interest, as it was discovered in 2003 that synthetic mimics of AFGPs can retain IRI activity,[19] but not thermal hysteresis or DIS, even after major structural modifications, suggesting this property may be easier to mimic (as it may not require ice-face binding) and it has application in cryopreservation.[20–23] What is clear, however, is that the synthetic mimics tend to be far less active than the natural antifreezes, yet the activity appears to be sufficient to enable beneficial cryopreservation outcomes.[22] In short, it might not be that the most active IRI material is the most useful (e.g., depending on how accessible it is) and recent results suggest that IRI activity can be induced by more than one mechanism, including those which do not include ice binding.[4,24];  It should be noted that Koop et al. have proposed a similar map based on growth rate constants, but only included highly active peptide (and PVA) ice growth inhibitors,[25] whereas we intend to include examples of, and activity data for, emerging materials at all activity levels.; The first, and most widely used, method for measuring IRI is the “splat” assay as shown by Knight.[26] This assay enables quick assessment of IRI activity by monitoring the growth of ice grains that have been nucleated rapidly at low temperatures (≈−80 °C) to ensure only growth (not nucleation) events are probed.;  More active IRIs (such as the antifreeze proteins) can inhibit ice growth for hours, but the majority of mimics are far less active than this, however all materials, no matter how active, will only slow ice growth, none can stop it completely.;  Ben et al. have reported domain recognition software to identify grain boundaries but it has not been widely used.[27] An adaptation of this method uses concentrated sucrose solutions (>20 wt%) to generate isolated ice crystals.;  Using this method, Koop and co-workers have analyzed the kinetics of ice growth in the context of LSW theory to generate inhibition constants,[25,28] but it is a slower method than the aforementioned “splat” assay, albeit one that provides detailed insight.;  PEG, which is not reported to have any ice-binding/interacting effects, cannot fully inhibit growth even at 100 mg mL−1.;  This not only shows the vast range of potential IRI activities, but also highlights the key challenge in the discovery of useful new materials in that any macromolecular material will slow ice growth if a sufficiently high concentration is added.;  A detailed discussion of AFGP/AFP’s high activity is beyond the scope of this feature article, but in both cases it appears to be due to specific recognition of the primary prism face of ice, which is the fastest growing face under standard conditions.[31] There is still uncertainty as to how exactly AFGPs bind ice though, either through their glycans,[32] or the peptide backbone.[33] Hyperactive AFPs, which display a larger thermal hysteresis gap can also bind the basal face.[34,35] Experimental and modeling evidence supports PVA’s unique activity being due to its hydroxyls precisely matching the spacing on the prism plane of ice, and a balance of enthalpy/entropy compensation leads to increased affinity and hence inhibition[36–38] due to a multivalent or “zipper” effect (Figure 2C).;  This also explains why many other polyols fail to inhibit growth as they do not have this extended stretch of hydroxyls with precise spacing, with a range of glycopolymers or carbohydrates (see Supporting Information) showing very little activity.[39,40] The molecular weight dependence of PVA’s activity has been explored in detail previously, and is outside the scope of this article.[38,41] Polymer chain architecture has also shown to be important, with three-arm PVA demonstrating IRI activity equal to that of a linear polymer the same length as two of the arms.[42] It has been suggested that this is because of the inability of the third arm to effectively bind a basal plane of ice, as the other two arms (binding in a linear fashion) confine the third.[37]; The previous section summarizes the activity range of materials with characterized (or hypothesized) ice-binding interactions.;  Safranin-O can inhibit all ice growth at just 1 mg mL−1, similar to PVA.; Supramolecular ice growth inhibitors.; In solution, zirconium acetate (ZrAc) can polymerize to form extended structures and it has been reported to have both ice shaping and IRI activity.[44,45] In solution, the structure of ZrAc produces a coordination polymer with regularly spaced hydroxyls and acetate groups, which could either hydrogen bond to ice (e.g., like PVA) or interact via hydrophobic interactions (as with AFPs).;  There is also a report of graphene oxide inhibiting ice growth in this concentration range (all growth stopped at 5 mg mL−1).[46] Graphene oxide is also known to affect ice nucleation[47,48]; such dual activity has also been observed for some AFPs.[49]; The previous examples are materials which have characterized ice-binding activity, either from direct measurements, or by observation of ice crystal shaping, and in most cases this affinity for the primary prism plane of ice is what drives their observable activity.;  In 2003, Ben et al. discovered that simplification of the AFGP structure to present only α-galactose (in place of the native disaccharide) and replacing alanine with glycine resulted in peptides that had definite IRI but no thermal hysteresis.[19] This finding suggested that it was possible to achieve potent IRI, but without the need to target a specific plane of ice, that is, there are multiple molecular level mechanisms which can give rise to the same macroscopic effect.;  The same group has reported a series of modified glycopeptides with potent IRI, with the distance between backbone[50] and glycan being important as well as backbone hydrophobicity.[51,52]Figure 4A shows anchored clathrate water on the surface of an AFP, which directs the binding to multiple ice planes (basal and prism) due to crystallographic matches.[53]Figure 4B shows a simulation of spruce budworm AFP and its hypothesized binding to the prism plane via coordinated water molecules providing a match.[54] Whilst the molecular binding details are still under investigation, there is overwhelming evidence for AFPs binding to ice faces and strong evidence of molecular level interactions have been determined.[34,55–59] However, for the facially amphipathic molecules, with no evidence for ice binding, an alternative molecular level mechanism which can give rise to IRI is required.;  One proposal is that these can sit at the semi-ordered water layer (sometimes referred to as quasi-liquid layer, QLL, which is strictly a definition at surfaces)[60]/bulk water interface, rather than directly interact with ice faces.[61,62] If the compounds can disorder this region, they will not fit well with bulk water, nor semi-ordered water later and hence the barrier to adding more water to the ice crystal is higher and slows recrystallization.[61]; Modes of action resulting in IRI (and in case of A/B ice shaping).;  B) Molecular dynamics results showing Spruce Budworm AFP with ordered water on AFP surface binding to the prism plane of ice.;  Increasing the alkyl chain length from seven to nine carbon atoms lead to an increase in activity (Figure 5) until micellization occurred.;  Micellization buries the hydrophobic units in the core and hence only hydrophilic units are presented, highlighting the delicate balance required in this approach to induce IRI.[63] Lysine-based surfactants with increasing hydrophobic modifications show increased IRI activity, and clearly have no ice-binding site.;  These carry a net charge confirming that a sugar unit is not an essential moiety for IRI.[64,65] It should be noted, however, that removing the glycan unit from an AFGP completely removes its ability to bind to ice effectively, as shown by Nishimura et al.,[66] which demonstrates that conclusions drawn for one class of IRI may not be valid for others.;  The actual IRI seen, however, was rather weak requiring 5 mg mL−1 to inhibit 50% of ice growth.;  AFPs and AFGPs also show facial amphiphilicity[66,68] and simulations suggest this facial amphiphilicity is crucial for AFGPs[33] but not necessarily for AFPs.[58,69] These experiments provided crucial data that a second structural feature, after ice binding, can be used to introduce IRI into a synthetic material; spatially segregated hydrophobic/hydrophilic domains, but without micellization.;  Mitchell et al. further used self-assembling metallohelices to probe this concept.;  The helices show patchy hydrophobicity and no obvious ice-binding sites, yet can inhibit ice growth completely at around 5 mg mL−1, making them one of the more potent synthetic inhibitors reported (Figure 6A,B).;  No ice shaping was seen for these materials, suggesting no ice binding.;  A) Self-assembled metallohelices.; It is clear that correct 3D placement of hydrophobic groups can modulate IRI activity and may be crucial in natural AF(G)Ps, in addition to their remarkable ice-binding properties.[2] However, in the case of synthetic polymers, most are flexible coils due to a saturated backbone with sp3 bonding, and cannot present specific “patches” of hydrophobicity.;  It is crucial to note here that the magnitude of activity is far less than the previous classes (AF(G)Ps/PVA) with some ice growth still occurring at 20 mg mL−1, hence care must be taken when discussing potency.;  There is also significant evidence for their selective and strong binding to specific planes of ice, which is crucial for their activity.;  These materials also shape ice and have potent IRI activity, with at least some of their activity arising from ice-face binding (if not all).;  After this, there are the materials that have no evidence for ice binding (at the moment) but are still relatively potent.;  It is crucial to note that ice binding could be occurring, but that it is so weak or transient that macroscopic ice shaping is not seen.;  However, these materials are facially amphiphilic with segregation of the domains crucial for their function, enabling them to slow ice growth fully, typically in a range <10 mg mL−1.;  It should be highlighted that these are approximate definitions, for example, the highly active lysine surfactants of Ben[63] have similar activity to the ice binders; hence the need for appreciation that IRI is a continuum not a binary property.;  Materials in this range do not appear to bind ice to any appreciable extent and in many cases cannot completely inhibit ice growth over any time period.;  Nonetheless, that does not rule out potential applications, where slowing ice is crucial or where high concentrations can be applied.;  It is important to note that the size indication is based on static 30 min measurement, and that in all cases the ice crystals keep growing and hence is a snapshot of a rate of growth.;  We also propose that the less active materials seem to be able to function due to their amphipathic structure, and can be more active due to a precise interaction with ice.; A 10 μL droplet of the macromolecule in PBS solution was dropped from 1.4 m onto a glass microscope coverslip, which is on top of an aluminum plate cooled to −78 °C using dry ice.;  The droplet freezes instantly upon impact with the plate, spreading out and forming a thin wafer of ice."

"ATP","D000255",26090360,4453477," A third focus of interest in alkaliphiles is the challenge raised by the use of proton-coupled ATP synthases for oxidative phosphorylation by non-fermentative alkaliphiles.;  The reversed gradient reduces the trans-membrane proton-motive force available to energize ATP synthesis.;  Multiple strategies are hypothesized to be involved in enabling alkaliphiles to circumvent the challenge of a low bulk proton-motive force energizing proton-coupled ATP synthesis at high pH.;  The extremophile enzyme that will then be highlighted in the final section is the F1Fo-ATP synthase that is found in Gram-positive alkaliphilic Bacillus strains, such as Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4 (Janto et al., 2011) and B. halodurans C-125 (Takami et al., 2000).;  The finding that such alkaliphilic aerobes use proton-coupled ATP synthases was a surprising finding, since the apparently low bulk proton-motive force (PMF) had led to the expectation that synthesis would be coupled to larger bulk sodium-ion gradients (Hicks and Krulwich, 1990; Krulwich, 1995).;  The use of protons at low bulk PMF has led to re-consideration of the idea that the PMF, which drives ATP synthesis, is the electrochemical gradient of protons between the bacterial cytoplasm and the bulk external milieu as envisioned in Peter Mitchell’s ground-breaking work (Mitchell, 1961).;  As will be discussed, these models include fast movement of protons along the outer surface of the coupling membrane between proton pumps and ATP synthases.;  A variety of emerging new findings now provide new opportunities to explore features that may together circumvent the “bioenergetic challenge” of proton-coupled ATP synthesis at low bulk PMF.;  Proton-coupling may have emerged early in alkaline hydrothermal vents, but may not have been immediately able to make levels of available energy comparable to levels made available by oxidative phosphorylation which involves electron transport by respiratory chain complexes and oxygen reduction, as it provides energy for proton-coupled ATP synthesis (Dimroth and Cook, 2004; Mulkidjanian et al., 2008, 2012).;  The name “Serpentinomonas raichei A1” has been proposed for this extremely alkaliphilic organism and its gene sequence indicates that it has an ATP synthase that couples to protons rather than sodium ions (Suzuki et al., 2014).;  As discussed in the final section of this review, S. raichei A1 and several other Gram-negative alkaliphiles that couple ATP synthesis to protons differ from Gram-positive alkaliphiles in the amino acid sequence motifs of two key subunits of the ATP synthase.;  This difference may provide clues to the range of adaptations that enable proton-coupled ATP synthesis to proceed under the adverse conditions of a low “bulk” PMF.;  Evidence has been presented for retention of other protons on or near the membrane where they move laterally and may reach PMF users such as ATP synthase before equilibrating with the bulk medium outside the cell (Heberle et al., 1994; Sandén et al., 2010; Rieger et al., 2014).;  In addition to energizing ATP synthesis, the proton-motive force (PMF) generated by respiration energizes the cation/proton antiporters that catalyze electrogenic import of more protons than the number of sodium ions that are exported in the antiporter turnover.;  This orientation of the pH gradient reduces the total PMF that drives proton-coupled processes such as proton-coupled ATP synthesis, and in many bacteria, proton-coupled uptake of solutes as well as motility.;  How then, do aerobic alkaliphiles carry out robust PMF-dependent work? The expected answer was that the low inwardly directed PMF would not be used by alkaliphiles but that the larger sodium-ion gradient could energize ATP synthesis just as it energizes alkaliphiles’ solute uptake systems and motility (Figure ​(Figure2).2).;  As mentioned earlier, there are indeed F1Fo-ATP synthases that are coupled to sodium ions.;  B. pseudofirmus OF4, which was originally named B. firmus OF4, was the first alkaliphile found to use a proton-coupled ATP synthase, in experiments using purified synthase reconstituted and assayed in proteoliposomes (Hicks and Krulwich, 1990).;  It was also noted that there was barely detectable hydrolytic activity, a typical feature of alkaliphile ATP synthases.;  Without suppression of ATP hydrolysis by alkaliphile synthases, alkaliphiles would be susceptible to loss of ATP via hydrolysis when the low PMF dipped stochastically.;  Subsequently, the expected use of protons by B. alcalophilus was reported (Hoffmann and Dimroth, 1991), and, since then, other aerobic and alkaliphilic strains have similarly exhibited proton-coupling, e.g., thermo-alkaliphilic Caldalkalibacillus thermarum strain TA2.A1, which only exhibits non-fermentative growth at alkaline pH values and couples the ATP synthase to protons (Cook et al., 2003; McMillan et al., 2009).; The model of an F1Fo-ATP synthase in Figure ​Figure3A3A is based on work by other investigators who have developed key features of this rotary machine (Stock et al., 2000; Yoshida et al., 2001; Boyer, 2002; Walker, 2013).;  Recently, a structural study of the a-subunit from the algae Polytomella sp., which has a dimeric F-type ATP synthase structure, has shown that the membrane-embedded helices of the a-subunit stator are horizontal relative to the c-ring (Allegretti et al., 2015).;  In addition to the major problem of an insufficient PMF to account for the ATP synthesis observed, challenges that were likely to require special adaptations included the risk of proton loss to an alkaline environment before the protons reach a proton binding site on the rotor ring or while the rotor ring is in rotation within the lipid milieu.;  In Figure ​Figure3B,3B, the operons encoding three different F1Fo-ATP synthases, from B. subtilis, alkaliphilic B. pseudofirmus OF4, and an actinomycete example, Nonomuraea ATCC39727 are compared.;  Like neutralophilic B. subtilis, alkaliphilic strain B. pseudofirmus OF4, has an atp operon with the expected eight structural, ATP synthase protein-encoding genes and an atpI gene whose protein product contributes to stability and assembly of the synthase (Suzuki et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2013).; (A) A model of a bacterial F1Fo-ATP synthase and (B) schematic examples of bacterial atp operons.;  The Fo sector contains the proton-conducting elements utilized to transform proton electrochemical gradients into rotational energy that supports ATP synthesis.;  Of special interest here are the a- and c-subunits in the Fo that work together to convert the proton electrochemical gradient into c-ring rotation, ultimately leading to ATP synthesis.;  In the earliest mutagenesis study, the K180 residue was replaced by glycine, the consensus residue for non-alkaliphiles, resulting in major loss of growth on malate at pH 10.5 but not 7.5 and major loss of ATP synthesis by ADP + Pi-loaded membrane vesicles while replacement of G212 by serine had a much smaller defect (Wang et al., 2004).;  The resulting ATP synthases were all defective in their ability to grow on malate and carry out ATP synthesis.; Special features of alkaliphilic Bacillus ATP synthase a-subunits.; The sequence similarity among 21 Bacillus alkaliphiles in identified alkaliphile amino acid variants in the ATP synthase a-subunit.; Phenotypes of B. pseudofirmus OF4 ATP synthase a-subunit mutants.;  The ΔGp is the phosphorylation potential (ΔG0’ + RT ln[ADP][Pi]/[ATP]) and the Δp is the proton-motive force (arithmetic sum of ΔpH in mV and the membrane potential).;  Mutagenesis studies on the two motifs showed that a quadruple mutant in which the four alanines of the AxAxAVA motif were changed to glycines resulted in loss of only 50% of the WT hydrolytic activity but loss of over 80% of the enzyme’s ATP synthesis capacity (Liu et al., 2009).;  The ATP synthase from the A16G mutant in the c-subunit displayed c-rings with both a c13 (WT) and c12 stoichiometry while double A16G/A20G mutants displayed c-rings with only a c12 stoichiometry (Liu et al., 2010).;  During the 360° rotation of the rotor ring, with the attached central stalk γϵ subunits, three ATPs are synthesized in the F1 sector β subunits.;  The number of coupling ions translocated for synthesis of the three molecules of ATP is determined by the c-ring stoichiometry: a larger c-ring is beneficial under circumstances of a lower PMF and vice versa; this notion is consistent with results of engineering of rotor ring stoichiometries both in upward and downward directions (Pogoryelov et al., 2012; Preiss et al., 2013).; In contrast to the scenario with aerobic alkaliphiles that couple c-rotor rotation exclusively to proton movements, it is worth noting that some anaerobic alkaliphiles, which are fermentative and do not carry out oxidative phosphorylation, can couple their ATPase (in this case a hydrolase) to pump sodium ions uphill against the trans-membrane ion gradient.; After proton-coupling of alkaliphile ATP synthases was clearly established, a major focus was set next on elements and hypotheses that rationalize the thermodynamic challenge of an apparently insufficient bulk PMF to account for the observed synthesis.;  Much of the effort and hypotheses have focused on rapid movement of protons from the proton-pumping complexes to the proton-coupled ATP synthase.;  The F1Fo-ATP synthase is shown embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane with a proton-pumping respiratory chain element near the synthase.; Finally, even stronger candidates for promoting micro-domains that might bring the proton pumps into greater proximity with the ATP synthase are membrane flotillins and their associated proteins (Lopez and Kolter, 2010; Bach and Bramkamp, 2013, 2015; Bramkamp and Lopez, 2015).;  The finding that alkaliphilic aerobes that grow non-fermentatively, use energy derived from a proton-pumping respiratory chains and complete oxidative phosphorylation using proton-coupled ATP synthases has challenged a tenet of the formal Mitchellian chemiosmotic hypothesis."

"water","D014867",33819431,8219186,"Water activity is an important characteristic for describing unusual waters and is a determinant of habitability for microorganisms.;  However, few empirical studies of water activity have been done for natural waters exhibiting an extreme chemistry.;  Here, we investigate water activity for acid brines from Western Australia and Chile with pH as low as 1.4, salinities as high as 32% total dissolved solids, and complex chemical compositions.;  For the most extreme brine, its water activity (0.714) was considerably lower than that of saturated (pure) NaCl brine.;  This study provides a thermodynamic insight into life within end-member natural waters that lie at, or possibly beyond, the very edge of habitable space on Earth. ; Acid brines are considered among the most extreme natural waters, based on their low pH, high salinities, and complex chemical compositions.;  However, little is known about a key thermodynamic parameter of acid brines: their water activity.;  For a solution or solid substance, it is water activity that defines water availability (relative humidity is used for a gas).;  At a given temperature and pressure, the maximum equilibrium relative humidity is designated the value 100%, whereas the maximum possible water activity, at a given temperature and pressure, is designated a value of 1.;  In general, the higher the concentration of solutes in a water, the lower the water activity.;  For example, seawater has ∼19,000 ppm (or mg/L) Cl-, ∼10,500 ppm Na+, and ∼2,700 ppm SO42-, accounting for ∼32,200 ppm, or ∼3.22% of the ∼3.5% total dissolved solids (TDS) in this natural water (Drever, 1997).;  Seawater has a relatively high water activity that is, nevertheless, stressful for some types of microorganisms (Brown, 1990).;  In general, the lower the water activity, the less likely the environment is to host a diverse biome (Larson and Belovsky, 2013; Stevenson et al.,
2015a; Lee et al.,
2018; Merlino et al.,
2018).;  A less widely appreciated aspect of low water activity of natural waters is the likely influence on physical processes such as evaporation and fluid flow (e.g., Raup, 1970; Benison et al.,
2008).; Despite the significance of specific water chemistry and geochemical processes to cellular life and the intimate interactions of ecosystems with the environment, the identification and characterization of the most-extreme waters on Earth is a relatively recent area of study.;  Terrestrial waters of both high salinity and low pH are among these extreme waters and are, perhaps, the least understood (Bowen and Benison, 2009; Benison and Bowen, 2015; Hallsworth, 2019a).;  In contrast, modern seawater has pH of approximately 8.1 and salinity of approximately 3.5% TDS (Drever, 1997).;  Brines are traditionally defined as waters with at least 10% TDS (Drever, 1997).;  Whereas there is no universally agreed pH value at which we define high-salinity, low-pH waters as acid brines, those with pH less than 5 contain no detectable carbonate or bicarbonate (Bowen and Benison, 2009).;  Western Australian lakes and groundwaters with pH <4 have been termed “extremely acidic” (Benison et al.,
2007).;  Only extreme xerophiles or halophiles can function below 0.800, and only a very small number of microbes are able to function below 0.755 water activity (Stevenson et al.,
2015a, 2015b; Lee et al.,
2018).;  Therefore, in this study, we will consider any brines with both pH <2 and < 0.755 water activity as the most-extreme acid brines.; Empirical studies of brine water activity have traditionally focused on synthetic solutions (most commonly of NaCl-H2O mixtures) rather than compositionally complex brines such as those of extreme acid-brine lakes (e.g., Winston and Bates, 1960; Robson and Loneragan, 1970; Chirife et al.,
1983; Grant, 2004; Lee et al.,
2018).;  To understand how far life can prevail under extreme thermodynamic constraints, more work is needed to elucidate the water chemistries of acid-brine systems and how these can impact cellular function.;  Here, we describe acid brines from lakes of Western Australia and northern Chile and reveal their measured water activities in the context of other biophysical and geochemical parameters.; Both equilibrium relative humidity and water activity are measures of the mole fraction of water, for the vapor phase and the liquid phase, respectively.;  At a given temperature and pressure, the maximum possible equilibrium relative humidity is designated the value 100% and the maximum possible water activity is designated a value of 1.;  All dissolved substances reduce water activity, so the more concentrated a solution of a specific salt is, the lower its water activity typically is.;  However, some salts/ions reduce water activity more than others, both at a given concentration, and due to their different valences and solubility limits (Winston and Bates, 1960).;  Generally, divalent salts such as MgCl2 depress water activity more than monovalent salts such as NaCl (Hallsworth et al.,
2007).;  Salts with a high solubility typically depress water activity to lower values than those that are less soluble (Winston and Bates, 1960).;  The water activity of a microbial substrate (or indeed any solution) of unknown composition can only be determined empirically (Brown, 1990), and such examples include the complex and undefined brines found in nature (Hallsworth et al.,
2007; Yakimov et al.,
2015; Rubin et al.,
2017; La Cono et al.,
2019).;  The vast majority of microbial species exhibit no metabolism or growth below 0.900 water activity, and, until recently, the metabolism/growth of extreme halophiles was thought to be limited to values of ≥0.755 water activity (Grant, 2004; Rummel et al.,
2014).;  We now know that this water activity, which is equivalent to saturated NaCl, does not prevent life in many brine systems and, indeed, is not at all inhibitory for some extremophiles.;  Empirical data show that only the most extremely halotolerant archaea can grow down to water activities as low as 0.635, and extrapolated values indicate theoretical limits as low as 0.611 (Stevenson et al.,
2015a).;  Recent studies of the fungal xerophile/halophile Aspergillus penicillioides have demonstrated differentiation and cell division at values as low as 0.585 water activity, albeit on glycerol-supplemented media, with a theoretically determined minimum of <0.565 (Stevenson et al.,
2017b).;  What has yet to be established for acid brines is how their extreme pH and complex composition influence/determine water activities, and whether the latter lie in the known range for active life.; In studies of geochemistry, microbiology, and astrobiology, the water activity of extreme waters has generally been derived by using models and then expressed to only two decimal places.;  Yet many methods to determine water activity are also inaccurate (as discussed by Yu et al.,
2009; Stevenson et al.,
2015a) and do not approach the same level of sensitivity as the microbial cell (see below).;  An additional challenge is that many natural waters from extreme environments have complex compositions that either do not allow for complete compositional identifications and/or are difficult, if not impossible, to produce a synthetic match in the laboratory.;  Natural acid brines, for example, are extremely acid, extremely saline, and contain unusually high concentrations of elements and compounds typically not found in higher than trace amounts in dilute, neutral waters.;  Nevertheless, empirical determinations of water activity for extremely acid brines have not yet been made.; Recent studies have shown that microbial systems are sensitive to changes in water activity of <0.010, and, in some cases, may be sensitive to ≤0.001 (Stevenson et al.,
2015b).;  It is therefore imperative to measure and express water activity to this level of accuracy.;  As stated by Stevenson et al. (2015b), “water activity determinations to one decimal place can lack biological meaning, and those made to two decimal places are far less [accurate] than what we would accept for biological studies [which focus on equivalent changes in] temperature or other environmental parameters.”; This current study investigates the water activities of lake waters from two distinctly different types of acid saline settings: lakes in Western Australia exist on an Archean craton and salars in northern Chile are hosted by volcaniclastic sediments above an active subduction zone (Figs. 1 and ​and2).2).;  Acid brines of Western Australia and northern Chile formed by different geologic processes, yet their geologic products (waters and minerals) are similar.;  These acid brines are among the most chemically extreme natural waters on Earth (Bowen and Benison, 2009; Benison and Bowen, 2015; Hallsworth, 2019a).;  Lake-water temperatures closely conform to the local air temperatures and range from 0°C to 50°C.;  The regional groundwater system is acid and saline, with an average pH of ∼3.5 (Bowen and Benison, 2009).;  Acid lake brines and associated groundwaters are chemically complex, with unusually high concentrations of minor elements and trace elements, including metals (Bowen and Benison, 2009).;  Water chemistry, including pH and salinity, fluctuates through time (hours to months) and space (meters to kilometers) due to flooding-evapoconcentration-desiccation cycles and localized water-rock interaction.;  In turn, the saturation states of the water with respect to minerals fluctuate over the same temporal and spatial scales; halite, as well as some other minerals, dissolves during flooding and precipitates during evapoconcentration.;  The waters also have changing saturation states with respect to other authigenic minerals, including gypsum, jarosite, alunite, hematite, and clays.;  This results in natural systems with highly variable authigenic mineral suites, as well as fluctuating water composition, pH, and salinity, over relatively small spatial and temporal scales (Benison et al.,
2007; Bowen and Benison, 2009; Benison and Bowen, 2013).;  The acid brines of Western Australia likely evolved over millions of years, involving (1) elimination by chemical weathering of any buffer minerals or compounds in a previous warm, wet climate; (2) oxidation of sulfide minerals disseminated in the host rocks to form sulfuric acid and iron oxides; and (3) the concentration of waters by evapoconcentration with aridification of climate (Benison and Bowen, 2015).;  Zaikova et al. (2018) analyzed a lake water (pH 2.3, 30% TDS), a groundwater (pH 3.4, 4% TDS), and a saline mudflat sediment (pH 1.7, 26% TDS) from Lake Magic near Hyden, Western Australia.;  Paradoxically for a hypersaline environment, the lake water hosted more eukaryotic microbes than bacteria, and there were very few archaea.;  The Lake Magic groundwater and sediment samples had more diverse communities of bacteria, with more eukaryotes than archaea.;  At Salar Gorbea, lake waters reach a pH value as low as 1.8 and salinity as high as 29% TDS.;  Lake waters at Salar Ignorado are less geochemically extreme; pH ranges from 3.3 to 4.1, and salinity ranges from 0.5% to 2.0% TDS (Benison, 2019a).;  Lake waters at Salars Gorbea and Ignorado are most likely evapoconcentrated hydrothermal waters that migrate upward from subsurface magma bodies (Karmanocky and Benison, 2016).; Microorganisms have been documented in acid waters at Salars Gorbea and Ignorado.; For this study of water activity, we sampled evapoconcentrated acid brine lake waters from Western Australia and Chile.;  In addition, we collected one seawater sample from Helen's Bay, County Down, Northern Ireland, to serve as a natural non-brine, non-acidic comparator.;  For the current study, we focused on lake water samples and their corresponding field data, from four lakes sampled in Western Australia in January 2009 and January 2015: (1) one sample from Gneiss Lake, east of the town of Grass Patch; (2) two samples from Lake Magic (also known in Bowen and Benison [2009] as Wave Rock Lake) near Hyden, collected from the same site 15 days apart; (3) one sample from Lake Aerodrome, a part of the Cowan Basin near Norseman; and (4) one sample from Twin Lake West, south of Salmon Gums.;  These water samples were selected to include some of the lowest pH and highest salinity ever reported, in contrast to measurements made during previous field trips (e.g., Benison et al.,
2007).;  Sampling dates and environmental conditions of lake water samples are shown in Table 1.;  All water samples were in evapoconcentrated stage.;  Three acid lake water samples from the two salars were used for comparison with the Western Australian acid brines.; In the field, we used multiple Oakton Double Junction pHTestr 2 portable pH meters to measure the pH of lake waters.;  Salinity of lake waters, as represented by TDS, was measured in the field with three handheld Hauke optical salinity refractometers (model HRS-28) equipped with automatic temperature compensation.;  The refractometers measure refractive index of a water sample and convert it to salinity expressed in % TDS (as known for various concentrations of solutions made by dilution and concentration of seawater) and specific gravity.;  Because the specific gravity of the water samples used in this study exceeds the maximum measurement of 1.070 g/cm3 on the refractometer scale, the specific gravities are not reported here; we estimate that they are as high as 1.22 g/cm3.;  The water temperatures and air temperatures were measured with plastic-encased glass and alcohol thermometers.;  Lake waters were collected by filling sterile high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with screw tops to the top, so there was no head space.; Major, minor, and trace element ion concentrations in the lake water samples were measured by a variety of techniques by Activation Laboratories Ltd. of Ancaster, Ontario, Canada.; Water activity was determined by measuring relative humidity above each water sample until equilibrium was reached.;  Most equipment manufactured to quantify water activity has levels of sensitivity which are an order of magnitude less than those of cellular systems (Stevenson et al.,
2015a, 2015b) and so have limited value for studies of microbiology or habitability.;  For this study, we employed a Novasina Humidat IC-II, an instrument capable of accurately measuring water activity to three decimal places.;  It can be manually calibrated along continuous scales of water activity and temperature and has been proven accurate for quantification of water activity to the third decimal place, including for undefined and complex brines (Hallsworth and Nomura, 1999; Stevenson et al.,
2015a; Yakimov et al.,
2015; La Cono et al.,
2019).; Calibration salts and brine samples were maintained at the temperature recorded during sampling, prior to water-activity determinations, which were also made at the same temperature.;  In each case, a Novasina IC-II water activity machine was first calibrated by using a saturated salt solution (i.e., NaCl, KCl, or K2SO4) with a water activity that was closest to that of the samples at the appropriate temperature.;  In the range of 25°C to 35°C, a saturated solution of pure NaCl (i.e., Na-Cl-H2O) has a water activity of 0.755; from 15°C to 20°C, it has a water activity of 0.760; and at 10°C, a water activity of 0.765 (Winston and Bates, 1960).; To test reproducibility of results, three independent replicates of each sample were used for water activity determinations.;  Accuracy was ±0.001 water activity in the pertinent range (0.900–0.600).; The field geochemistry and water activity measurements for four Western Australian acid saline lakes and three pools at two Chilean acid salars are summarized in Table 1.;  Salinities ranged from 5% to 32% TDS, pH ranged from 1.4 to 3.8, temperatures ranged from 14°C to 34°C, and measured water activities ranged from 0.944 down to 0.714.;  The seawater sample had a measured water activity of 0.980 at 20.0°C.;  The lower the pH in these lake waters, the higher the salinity tended to be (Fig. 3a).;  It is likely that water-rock interactions, which produce ions in solution, are enhanced by lower pH solutions (Benison and Bowen, 2015), thereby adding more ions to the lake waters.;  Likewise, there is a relationship between water activity and salinity, as well as between water activity and pH (Fig. 3b, ​,3c).3c).;  In general, the higher the salinity, the lower the water activity, and the lower the pH, the lower the water activity.;  Of the water samples, that with the lowest water activity (0.714) had the highest salinity (32% TDS) and lowest pH (1.4).;  Three samples from three different Western Australian lakes should be considered the most-extreme brines because they had both pH less than 2 and water activity less than 0.755.;  Conversely, except for the seawater sample, the highest water activity (0.944) was measured for the water sample from an acid saline lake in Chile with lowest salinity (3.8% TDS) and the highest pH (3.8).;  However, the relationships among water activity, salinity, and pH are not linear.;  The two Lake Magic waters had the same salinity (30% TDS) but have different pH and water activities; the pH 1.6 Lake Magic sample had a water activity of 0.726, and the pH 2.0 Lake Magic sample has a water activity of 0.742.;  Salar Gorbea's site 7 water, with 28% TDS salinity and pH 2.7, had a considerably higher water activity (0.799) than Twin Lake West sample (0.745), despite a similar salinity and pH (27% TDS and pH 2.6).; Plots showing relationships among pH, salinity, and water activity. (a) pH versus salinity (expressed as percent of total dissolved solids). (b) pH versus water activity. (c) Salinity versus water activity.;  There was a slight influence of temperature on water activity; at 30°C, this 1.4 pH, 32% TDS water has a water activity of 0.717.;  At 4°C higher, the same acid brine sample has a measured water activity of 0.714.;  Although the lake waters were precipitating salt minerals at the time of collection due to evaporation in the environment, no further precipitation was observed after collection.;  In contrast, Mg:Ca in seawater is approximately 5:1 and Al:Ca in seawater is 0.008:1.;  Al:Ca, however, ranges from 0.3:1 to 9.9:1 in Western Australian samples and 16.4:1 to 25.4:1 in Salar Gorbea waters.;  Furthermore, natural saline waters that have negligible levels of HCO3- (below limits of detection) are scarce and are restricted to low-pH solutions (Bowen and Benison, 2009).; Whereas the measured water-activity values were more extreme than we had anticipated, the geochemical data for the samples in this study fall within the compositional ranges detected in previous, more detailed geochemical analyses of previously sampled acid brines from the same locations in Western Australia and Chile (Risacher et al.,
2002; Bowen and Benison, 2009; Kipnis et al.,
2020).;  These acid brines are considerably more enriched in major and minor ions than seawater and are more chemically complex and more spatially and temporally variable than other well-known salt-precipitating brines, such as those of Badwater Basin in Death Valley and the Dead Sea (Hunt et al.,
1966; Salhotra et al.,
1985; Lowenstein and Risacher, 2009).; This study shows that pH and ionic compositions/concentrations of solutions, in addition to total salinity and temperature, are important factors in water activity of natural brines.;  Previous empirical measurements of water activity in brines have most commonly focused on synthetic salt solutions with a limited number of dissolved salt compounds, most commonly NaCl or MgCl2 (e.g., Harrison et al.,
2013; Stevenson et al.,
2015a).;  The acid brines of this current study are considerably more complex, characterized by a large range of ions, including Na, Cl, SO42-, Mg, Ca, and K, but also high concentrations of Br, Al, Fe, and Si, which are absent or of negligible concentrations in most natural waters.; The relationships between salinity and water activity, or between pH and water activity, are not perfectly linear (Fig. 3).;  Therefore, other factors, such as elemental types and concentrations, appear to play a significant role in the water activity.;  Salar Gorbea site 10 water, at 18% TDS, 1.8 pH, and 14°C, had significantly higher Cl, SO4, Si, and Al than more saline, less acid, and warmer Gorbea site 7 water.;  All waters studied from Western Australia had water activities lower than synthetic NaCl-saturated brines, which have been measured at 0.755 in the same general temperature range (25°C to 35°C) as the Western Australian waters (Winston and Bates, 1960).; The water studied with the highest salinity and the lowest pH was from Gneiss Lake in Western Australia.;  This sample was measured for water activity at two different temperatures.;  At 30°C, the water activity was 0.717, and at 34°C, it was only lower by 0.003, with a water activity of 0.714.;  This study demonstrates that temperature differences, in the range of 4°C at least, may have a moderate effect on water activity in acid brines.;  Therefore, at times of greater environmental extremes, the lakes may reach even lower water activities than measured in this study.;  Possible water-activity values below 0.714 are likely when a lake is at a more evapoconcentrated stage, just prior to desiccation.;  This current study also reveals that a slight increase in temperature can lower a brine's water activity.;  The highest air and water temperature we have recorded at an acid saline lake in Western Australia is 50°C (Benison et al.,
2007), although samples from that temperature were not included in the current study.;  Regardless of this, the dynamic nature of environmental conditions at these most extreme acid brine lakes suggests the potential for water-activity values lower than those measured.;  Mormile et al. (2009) used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to determine DNA from waters sampled at 11 Western Australian lakes, including Gneiss Lake and Twin Lake.;  Studies of Lake Magic waters have shown that there is a diverse community in which fungi and algae are more abundant and diverse than bacteria, and in which archaea are almost absent (Zaikova et al.,
2018).;  However, even during flooding stage, at which time the waters are more dilute and less acidic, the combined environmental conditions of high salinity, low pH, complex water composition, fluctuating water chemistry and availability, and high solar radiation impose a selection pressure that favors polyextremophiles.;  Nevertheless, it is intriguing to note that it can tolerate the combination of extreme pH, reduced water activity, osmotic stress, and ionic conditions while retaining biotic function.;  Furthermore, from culture-based studies of isolated microbial strains, we have not yet identified a microbe capable of confirmed growth in saturated brines with acidity in the range pH 1–2 and water activity ≤0.755.;  The close association between microorganisms and organic compounds such as beta carotene suggests that these microorganisms are living in the lake water and not simply getting carried into the lake by wind.;  The observed heterogeneity of microbial communities among shallow lakes within kilometers of one another, as well as the distinctly different communities in Lake Magic lake water contrasted to sandflat sediment adjacent to Lake Magic, suggests that a majority of microorganisms are adapted to individual lakes and their specific water geochemistry (Mormile et al.,
2009; Zaikova et al.,
2018).;  Western Australian lake waters with salinity at or above 29% TDS and pH at or below 1.8 all had measured water activities less than 0.726, suggesting to us that these lakes may indeed be habitats for polyextremophiles.;  At pH 2.0, 30% TDS, and 29°C, this shallow lake water had a water activity of 0.742.;  The lake water at this time and under these environmental conditions hosted a diverse community.;  Prokaryotes in this Lake Magic water were of low diversity and abundance, with only 0.030% of reads attributed to archaea.;  The alphaproteobacterial genus Methylobacterium was detected in Lake Magic waters, but the most abundant bacterium was the proteobacterial genus Salinisphaera (Zaikova et al.,
2018).;  Eukaryotes dominated this Lake Magic water, composing 73% of reads.;  In addition to fungi, Lake Magic I lake water sample also included several genera of green alga: Dunaliella, Volvox, Oedogonium, and Monoraphidium (Zaikova et al.,
2018), but no diatoms.;  This Lake Magic I sample suggests that environments with a water activity beyond that of saturated NaCl might possibly support active communities of diverse microbes, and that haloarchaea are not necessarily the dominant organisms in acid brines.; Previous studies suggest a lack of biotic activity in brines of pH <3 and <0.750 water activity (Harrison et al.,
2013).;  Such metabolic activity is, however, plausible because some halophiles are known to retain biotic activity and undergo cell division beyond the water activity of NaCl-saturated brines, and even close to or below 0.600 (Stevenson et al.,
2015a, 2017a, 2017b; Lee et al.,
2018).;  We propose that, even at low pH, active life may occur at water activity values below the relatively moderate value of 0.755 (Lee et al.,
2018).;  The presence of microbial communities in acid brines of pH 1.8 and water activity 0.726 (see above) keeps alive the intriguing question of whether the resident acidotolerant halophiles are metabolically active at times when the waters are so concentrated.; The current study determined low water activity for modern, terrestrial acid brines that host diverse communities of microorganisms, including archaea, bacteria, fungi, and algae.;  Microorganisms and organic compounds are entrapped within primary fluid inclusions in these Permian and Triassic halites, strongly suggesting that life existed in these ancient extreme environments, some of which likely had water activities lower than 0.714 (Benison, 2019b).;  Some Archean and Paleoproterozoic sedimentary rocks are composed of high concentrations of silica and iron oxides due to depositional waters enriched in Si and Fe, like some modern acid brines.;  Our study of water activities in modern acid brines may have implications for better understanding the links between geochemistry and microbial life for Precambrian Earth and perhaps on Mars.; Using a model-based approach, Tosca et al. (2008) derived a value of 0.400 water activity for ancient brines that precipitated saline minerals on the surface at Meridiani Planum, Mars, which suggests that life on Mars was highly unlikely.;  Whereas other studies of water availability on Mars have drawn similar conclusions for the surface and shallow subsurface (Rummel et al.,
2014; Hallsworth, 2020).;  A study of deep-sea brines claims active life at 0.400 water activity (Steinle et al.,
2018), although there is no direct biological evidence for this (Hallsworth, 2019b).;  Modeling of water activity of acid brines has not yet been validated by empirical measurements.;  Future studies that test how well water-activity measurements compare to modeled results for acid brines are needed before potential for habitability based on water activity can be reliably predicted for Mars.;  Studies of synthetic martian brines report water-activity values up to 0.984 (Fox-Powell et al.,
2016), and studies of salt deliquescence suggest that perchlorate brines form on present-day Mars with water activities up to 0.800.;  We propose that the low water activities of habitable acid brines on Earth increase the likelihood that, at moderate martian temperatures, some microbes might be capable of metabolic activity on Mars.; Here, for natural, compositionally complex acid brines, we revealed their water activity that was previously unknown, and we explain why models cannot be used to accurately quantify water activity.;  Measured water activities of Western Australian lakes were considerably beyond those of saturated NaCl brines, from 0.745 to 0.714.;  Lakes in northern Chile were less extreme in terms of water activity (0.944 to 0.799), as well as their pH and salinity.;  In general, the lower the pH, the lower the water activity.;  The combination of extreme water activity, pH, and salinity in Western Australian brines, which contain phylogenetically diverse communities of microbes that are presumably acidotolerant/acidophilic and halophilic, expands our knowledge of the biophysical limits for life on Earth and beyond this planet."
"brine","C017082",33819431,8219186," Here, we investigate water activity for acid brines from Western Australia and Chile with pH as low as 1.4, salinities as high as 32% total dissolved solids, and complex chemical compositions.;  These acid brines host diverse communities of extremophilic microorganisms, including archaea, bacteria, algae, and fungi, according to metagenomic analyses.;  For the most extreme brine, its water activity (0.714) was considerably lower than that of saturated (pure) NaCl brine.; Acid brines are considered among the most extreme natural waters, based on their low pH, high salinities, and complex chemical compositions.;  However, little is known about a key thermodynamic parameter of acid brines: their water activity.;  Nevertheless, and surprising to some in the scientific community, evidence of microbial communities has been documented for a number of acid brines (Mormile et al.,
2009; Escudero et al.,
2013, 2018; Johnson et al.,
2015, 2020; Zaikova et al.,
2018).; Modern acid brines with pH as low as 1.4 and salinity as high as 32% TDS are known from ephemeral lakes in southern Western Australia (Benison et al.,
2007; Bowen and Benison, 2009; Benison and Bowen, 2015).;  Whereas there is no universally agreed pH value at which we define high-salinity, low-pH waters as acid brines, those with pH less than 5 contain no detectable carbonate or bicarbonate (Bowen and Benison, 2009).;  At pH less than ∼3.5, relatively high concentrations of Al, Fe, and Si can exist in brines in Western Australia and Chile (Risacher et al.,
2002; Bowen and Benison, 2009) and help to precipitate minerals such as alunite, jarosite, Fe-oxides, and clays (Benison et al.,
2007; Story et al.,
2010; Benison and Bowen, 2013; Benison, 2019a).;  All acid brines in Western Australia and Chile precipitate halite and gypsum as well, making these a complex form of NaCl-CaSO4 saturated brines (Risacher et al.,
2002; Benison et al.,
2007; Bowen and Benison, 2009; Benison, 2019a).;  Therefore, in this study, we will consider any brines with both pH <2 and < 0.755 water activity as the most-extreme acid brines.; Empirical studies of brine water activity have traditionally focused on synthetic solutions (most commonly of NaCl-H2O mixtures) rather than compositionally complex brines such as those of extreme acid-brine lakes (e.g., Winston and Bates, 1960; Robson and Loneragan, 1970; Chirife et al.,
1983; Grant, 2004; Lee et al.,
2018).;  To understand how far life can prevail under extreme thermodynamic constraints, more work is needed to elucidate the water chemistries of acid-brine systems and how these can impact cellular function.;  For example, it is unclear whether microbial communities found in situ are active during the evapoconcentration phase of lakes when brine chemistry is at its most extreme.;  Here, we describe acid brines from lakes of Western Australia and northern Chile and reveal their measured water activities in the context of other biophysical and geochemical parameters.;  The water activity of a microbial substrate (or indeed any solution) of unknown composition can only be determined empirically (Brown, 1990), and such examples include the complex and undefined brines found in nature (Hallsworth et al.,
2007; Yakimov et al.,
2015; Rubin et al.,
2017; La Cono et al.,
2019).;  We now know that this water activity, which is equivalent to saturated NaCl, does not prevent life in many brine systems and, indeed, is not at all inhibitory for some extremophiles.;  It is not surprising, therefore, that NaCl-saturated brines can support biomass-dense and biodiverse ecosystems, which are dominated by microbial halophiles (Lee et al.,
2018).;  What has yet to be established for acid brines is how their extreme pH and complex composition influence/determine water activities, and whether the latter lie in the known range for active life.;  Water-activity values of these brines derived from models, however, can only be trusted if validated via empirical determinations.;  Natural acid brines, for example, are extremely acid, extremely saline, and contain unusually high concentrations of elements and compounds typically not found in higher than trace amounts in dilute, neutral waters.;  Nevertheless, empirical determinations of water activity for extremely acid brines have not yet been made.;  Acid brines of Western Australia and northern Chile formed by different geologic processes, yet their geologic products (waters and minerals) are similar.;  These acid brines are among the most chemically extreme natural waters on Earth (Bowen and Benison, 2009; Benison and Bowen, 2015; Hallsworth, 2019a).; Locations of acid brines used in this study. (a) Four acid brine lakes on the Yilgarn Craton of southern Western Australia. (b) Two acid salars on the Altiplano of northern Chile.;  Acid lake brines and associated groundwaters are chemically complex, with unusually high concentrations of minor elements and trace elements, including metals (Bowen and Benison, 2009).;  The acid brines of Western Australia likely evolved over millions of years, involving (1) elimination by chemical weathering of any buffer minerals or compounds in a previous warm, wet climate; (2) oxidation of sulfide minerals disseminated in the host rocks to form sulfuric acid and iron oxides; and (3) the concentration of waters by evapoconcentration with aridification of climate (Benison and Bowen, 2015).; Life in acid brine lakes in Western Australia is confined to microorganisms, yet these microorganisms live in diverse communities.;  Work has not yet been carried out to determine the biophysical/physicochemical limits for biotic function of these acid brine ecosystems (and whether they are active during the evapoconcentration stage).;  These two acid salars, along with four acid-brine lakes of Western Australia, are the focus of the current study.; For this study of water activity, we sampled evapoconcentrated acid brine lake waters from Western Australia and Chile.;  In addition, we collected one seawater sample from Helen's Bay, County Down, Northern Ireland, to serve as a natural non-brine, non-acidic comparator.;  Three acid lake water samples from the two salars were used for comparison with the Western Australian acid brines.;  It can be manually calibrated along continuous scales of water activity and temperature and has been proven accurate for quantification of water activity to the third decimal place, including for undefined and complex brines (Hallsworth and Nomura, 1999; Stevenson et al.,
2015a; Yakimov et al.,
2015; La Cono et al.,
2019).; Calibration salts and brine samples were maintained at the temperature recorded during sampling, prior to water-activity determinations, which were also made at the same temperature.;  The natural acid brines and calibration solutions were allowed to equilibrate at the required temperature for 2–3 weeks.; There was a general relationship between pH and salinity in these Western Australian and Chilean brines.;  Three samples from three different Western Australian lakes should be considered the most-extreme brines because they had both pH less than 2 and water activity less than 0.755.;  At 4°C higher, the same acid brine sample has a measured water activity of 0.714.;  For example, ratios of Mg:Ca ranged from 14.9:1 to 94.3:1 in Western Australian brines and 143.2:1 to 174.0:1 in Salar Gorbea brines.;  Ratios were much lower in Salar Ignorado brine, that is, 1.14:1.;  A high range and high concentration of some individual ion concentrations also characterize these acid brines.;  The Al concentrations of 5660 and 3610 mg/L in the Chilean acid brines and 2870 mg/L in Gneiss Lake are among the highest dissolved Al recorded in the scientific literature.;  When added to the high Na and Cl in these acid brines, the unusual ratios of major elements Mg, Ca, and K, as well as high concentrations of SO4, Mg, Br, Al, Si, and Fe, can confer idiosyncratic physical properties and behaviors on these complex brines.; Whereas the measured water-activity values were more extreme than we had anticipated, the geochemical data for the samples in this study fall within the compositional ranges detected in previous, more detailed geochemical analyses of previously sampled acid brines from the same locations in Western Australia and Chile (Risacher et al.,
2002; Bowen and Benison, 2009; Kipnis et al.,
2020).;  These acid brines are considerably more enriched in major and minor ions than seawater and are more chemically complex and more spatially and temporally variable than other well-known salt-precipitating brines, such as those of Badwater Basin in Death Valley and the Dead Sea (Hunt et al.,
1966; Salhotra et al.,
1985; Lowenstein and Risacher, 2009).; This study shows that pH and ionic compositions/concentrations of solutions, in addition to total salinity and temperature, are important factors in water activity of natural brines.;  Previous empirical measurements of water activity in brines have most commonly focused on synthetic salt solutions with a limited number of dissolved salt compounds, most commonly NaCl or MgCl2 (e.g., Harrison et al.,
2013; Stevenson et al.,
2015a).;  The acid brines of this current study are considerably more complex, characterized by a large range of ions, including Na, Cl, SO42-, Mg, Ca, and K, but also high concentrations of Br, Al, Fe, and Si, which are absent or of negligible concentrations in most natural waters.;  In addition, acids such as H2SO4, HCl, and HBr make these acid brines unusual.;  All waters studied from Western Australia had water activities lower than synthetic NaCl-saturated brines, which have been measured at 0.755 in the same general temperature range (25°C to 35°C) as the Western Australian waters (Winston and Bates, 1960).;  This study demonstrates that temperature differences, in the range of 4°C at least, may have a moderate effect on water activity in acid brines.; The acid brine samples from Western Australian lakes were collected during evapoconcentration stage for this study.;  This current study also reveals that a slight increase in temperature can lower a brine's water activity.;  Regardless of this, the dynamic nature of environmental conditions at these most extreme acid brine lakes suggests the potential for water-activity values lower than those measured.; Acid brines host microbially diverse communities of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, many of which are novel.;  We cannot be certain that these microbes are metabolically active during the evaporative stage of acid-brine lakes when the brines are at their most concentrated and most acidic.;  However, Acidohalobacter has not been identified in acid brine lakes thus far.;  Furthermore, the NaCl tolerance of 7.5% (w/v) would be insufficient for activity in the acid brines reported in the current study.;  Furthermore, from culture-based studies of isolated microbial strains, we have not yet identified a microbe capable of confirmed growth in saturated brines with acidity in the range pH 1–2 and water activity ≤0.755.;  The novel taxa identified in extreme acid brines during metagenomic surveys have yet to be studied in relation to their stress biology to determine their biophysical limits when using culture-based systems.;  This Lake Magic I sample suggests that environments with a water activity beyond that of saturated NaCl might possibly support active communities of diverse microbes, and that haloarchaea are not necessarily the dominant organisms in acid brines.; Previous studies suggest a lack of biotic activity in brines of pH <3 and <0.750 water activity (Harrison et al.,
2013).;  Such metabolic activity is, however, plausible because some halophiles are known to retain biotic activity and undergo cell division beyond the water activity of NaCl-saturated brines, and even close to or below 0.600 (Stevenson et al.,
2015a, 2017a, 2017b; Lee et al.,
2018).;  The presence of microbial communities in acid brines of pH 1.8 and water activity 0.726 (see above) keeps alive the intriguing question of whether the resident acidotolerant halophiles are metabolically active at times when the waters are so concentrated.; The current study determined low water activity for modern, terrestrial acid brines that host diverse communities of microorganisms, including archaea, bacteria, fungi, and algae.;  These Permo-Triassic acid lake brines were also enriched in Al, Fe, and/or Si (Benison et al.,
1998).; Modern and Permo-Triassic acid brine lakes may share some geochemical similarities with Precambrian Earth environments that hosted early life.;  Some Archean and Paleoproterozoic sedimentary rocks are composed of high concentrations of silica and iron oxides due to depositional waters enriched in Si and Fe, like some modern acid brines.;  Our study of water activities in modern acid brines may have implications for better understanding the links between geochemistry and microbial life for Precambrian Earth and perhaps on Mars.; Using a model-based approach, Tosca et al.

2018), although there is no direct biological evidence for this (Hallsworth, 2019b).;  It is not known how accurate modeling is for extreme acid brines; such modeling may be complicated by the complex chemical compositions, as well as low pH, high salinities, and a wide range of temperatures that would be likely on Mars.;  Modeling of water activity of acid brines has not yet been validated by empirical measurements.;  Future studies that test how well water-activity measurements compare to modeled results for acid brines are needed before potential for habitability based on water activity can be reliably predicted for Mars.; Mars likely also hosted acid brines in the past.;  Mineral assemblages found on Mars, including chlorides, hydrated calcium sulfates, jarosite, alunite, silica, and clay minerals, are consistent with those precipitated by modern and ancient terrestrial acid brines (e.g., Benison and LaClair, 2003; Squyres et al.,
2004; Benison, 2006, 2019a; Benison and Bowen, 2006).;  In terrestrial acid-brine lakes, precipitation of chemical sediments halite and gypsum entraps microorganisms within primary fluid inclusions.;  Studies of synthetic martian brines report water-activity values up to 0.984 (Fox-Powell et al.,
2016), and studies of salt deliquescence suggest that perchlorate brines form on present-day Mars with water activities up to 0.800.;  We propose that the low water activities of habitable acid brines on Earth increase the likelihood that, at moderate martian temperatures, some microbes might be capable of metabolic activity on Mars.; Here, for natural, compositionally complex acid brines, we revealed their water activity that was previously unknown, and we explain why models cannot be used to accurately quantify water activity.;  Measured water activities of Western Australian lakes were considerably beyond those of saturated NaCl brines, from 0.745 to 0.714.;  The combination of extreme water activity, pH, and salinity in Western Australian brines, which contain phylogenetically diverse communities of microbes that are presumably acidotolerant/acidophilic and halophilic, expands our knowledge of the biophysical limits for life on Earth and beyond this planet."
"phenolic","C017616",36581887,9798632," However, kraft lignins are a valuable source of phenolic compounds that can be valorized in new bio-based products.; Laccases are particularly suitable to act on kraft lignins extracted from the black liquors of kraft pulping due to the strong phenolic nature of these technical lignins.;  Content in phenolic (a) and carbonylic groups (b) in control (grey) and treated eucalyptus kraft lignin with laccases Li10 (blue), Li11 (purple) and C-LeB (green).; Wild fungal laccases commonly show maximum activities at pH 2–3 with ABTS and pH 3–5 for oxidation of phenolic compounds [36]. In fact, the wild fungal laccase, PM1L, has maximum activities at pH 2 with ABTS and 3–4 with DMP [33], while 7A12 shows maximum activities at pH 3 with ABTS [32] and pH 4 with DMP (Fig. 2A).;  Both enzymes showed the typical pH-dependent bell-shaped activity profile for oxidation of phenolic compounds.;  Mutations F392N and F392T were also selected in a previous study, proving to promote the interaction of phenolic substrates in the active site by opening the enzyme pocket, and resulting in the shift of activity towards more neutral pH [26]. Other mutations in this position seem to modify the binding site anchor [41].; The loss of affinity for DMP at alkaline pH observed in Li10 variant may be related to changes in the protonation state of the residues of the catalytic pocket, from more positively to negatively charged with increasing pH, which might disturb the positioning and binding of the substrate [26]. Besides, replacement of hydrophobic Phe392 delimiting the substrate-binding pocket by polar Asn in Li10 may also alter the substrate–protein interaction [26]. Also, deprotonation of lignin phenolic compounds at alkaline pH [45] might influence substrate binding.; During the laccase engineering campaign resulting in RY2, Asn263 located in the entrance of the substrate-binding pocket was mutated to Asp263 with the objective of improving the affinity for aniline at acid pH [27]. This aspartate residue stabilized the anilinium cation in the active site and favoured the electron transfer at acidic pH [46]. The mutations selected here in position 263 demonstrated that non-charged, non-polar and small amino acids (Val, Ala, Gly) are preferred for the oxidation of phenolic substrates at pH ≥ 8 (Additional File 1: Fig.; Enzymatic depolymerization of kraft lignins into phenolic platform chemicals and polyols embodies one of the potential breakthrough applications for valorization of kraft lignins whose recovery in pulp mills was 265,000 t in 2018 [57] and it is expected to increase in the coming years.; Kraft lignins are characterized by the high content in free phenolic OH groups caused by the breakdown of aryl-ether bonds during kraft pulping [58]. This greatly favours the oxidation of kraft lignin by laccase to form phenoxyl radicals.;  Here, lignin oxidation was evidenced by the increment in carbonyl content after 2 h of laccase treatment, whereas the increment of free phenolic groups suggested bond cleavage and, therefore, lignin depolymerization.;  Thereafter, the decrease in the phenolic content [63] and some increased in the Mw distribution of lignin after 24 h of laccase treatment correlate with the occurrence of non-enzymatic repolymerization reactions, although some low-Mw peaks were also found.;  The phenolic and carbonyl contents of laccase-treated and control lignins were spectrophotometrically determined by Folin Ciocalteu Reactive (Abs. 760 nm) and Brady reagent (Abs. 450 nm), respectively [47] Mw distribution of lignin samples were determined by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex75 column pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 11.6)."

By contrast, Li10 and C-LeB laccases developed here, which are active on lignin phenols at pH 8–10, hold a Met in this position due to the presence of mutation F460M, but conserve the high redox potential of parent laccase RY2 (with a Phe in this position).;  Best variant selected by improved oxidation of lignin phenols in each directed evolution round was used as parent for the next round."

"lignin","D008031",34669438,8752141," To explore the degradation potential of specific thermophiles, we have identified and characterized extremophilic microorganisms isolated from hot springs environments that are capable of biodegrading lignin and cellulose substrates under thermoalkaline conditions, using a combination of culturing, genomics, and metabolomics techniques.;  Organisms that can use lignin and cellulose as a sole carbon source at 60 to 75°C were isolated from sediment slurry of thermoalkaline hot springs (71 to 81°C and pH 8 to 9) of Yellowstone National Park.;  Interestingly, most of these isolates demonstrated biofilm formation on lignin, a phenotype that is correlated with increased bioconversion.;  Assessment of metabolite level changes in two Geobacillus isolates from two representative springs were undertaken to characterize the metabolic responses associated with growth on glucose versus lignin carbon source as a function of pH and temperature.;  Microbial ligninolytic and cellulolytic enzymes are of high interest in biorefineries for the valorization of lignocellulosic biomass, as they can withstand the extreme conditions (e.g., high temperature and high pH) required for processing.;  Of great interest is the ligninolytic potential of specific Geobacillus thermoleovorans isolates to function at a broad range of pH and temperatures, since lignin is the bottleneck in the bioprocessing of lignocellulose.;  In this study, results obtained from G. thermoleovorans isolates originating from YNP springs are significant because very few microorganisms from alkaline thermal environments have been discovered to have lignin- and cellulose-biodegrading capabilities, and this work opens new avenues for the biotechnological valorization of lignocellulosic biomass at an industrial scale.;  Alkaline pretreatment of LCB waste at high temperatures has been considered an effective approach due to its high selectivity for the depolymerization of lignin into simple sugars, which can then be fermented into ethanol (3, 4, 9, 12).;  The biological deconstruction of lignocellulose in well-characterized bacteria and saprophytic fungi is driven by a complementary set of ligninolytic and cellulolytic enzymes, which are involved in the depolymerization of different constituents and are often stable under both high temperatures and alkaline conditions (13,–17).;  The pathways for lignin degradation, primarily driven by fungi, require specialized enzymes, including laccases, glucanases, multicopper oxidases, and phenol oxidases (2, 5, 13,–15, 18).;  Since lignin biodegradation is the major bottleneck of lignocellulose conversion, these microbial ligninolytic enzymes are of high interest in biorefineries, since they represent a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to abiotic chemical processes (5) to improve biofuel production from feedstock waste products.;  In one of the springs, several trees have naturally fallen into the water, and we observed white colored remnants of plant biomass similar to those typically produced by lignin-degrading white rot fungi (Basidiomycota) present in natural moderate temperature environments (15).;  The characteristic biomass remnants found in that spring are thus likely enriched in cellulose and depleted in lignin (see Table S1).;  G. thermoleovorans isolates obtained from these two representative thermal springs were successfully cultured in the laboratory and investigated using lignocellulosic substrates, including lignin, cellulose, and xylose, with incubations at pH 8.5 and 70°C.;  Some G. thermoleovorans isolates displayed a particular phenotype in the presence of lignin as the sole carbon source, forming a biofilm structure that was not observed when grown on cellulose or xylose.;  By further characterizing and identifying cellular metabolites produced by these organisms when grown on different carbon sources (e.g., lignin versus glucose) across a range of pH and temperature conditions, we have begun to characterize specific features of their metabolic responses.;  Results from this study provide insights into metabolic use of lignin as an energy source in these isolates of the two representative thermoalkaline springs.; Following successive streaking on agar plates containing purified lignin, cellulose, or xylose as the only carbon source, cell cultures were incubated at 60°C for 10 days, facilitating the isolation of distinct lignocellulose-degrading microbial colonies with diverse morphologies (see Fig.; Phylogenetic tree of the Geobacillus thermoleovorans isolates obtained by enrichment on lignin (L), cellulose (C), and xylose (X) substrates from Treefall (TF) and Five Sisters 2 (FS2) springs, based on Sanger sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes.;  All strains contain a single copy of the lignin peroxidase (CAZyme AA2) encoding gene, and from two to three copies of the gene encoding a vanillyl alcohol oxidase (AA4) enzyme.;  In addition, each organism contains a single copy of the Mn superoxide dismutase gene (codA) and an additional gene characterized as codA-like, suggesting that G. thermoleovorans may have multiple metabolic pathways for lignin degradation.;  While this does not support our hypothesis that the Treefall spring specifically hosts a microbial population capable of degradation complex carbon substrates, the close sequence similarity of these different G. thermoleovorans strains suggests that they might be capable of degrading lignin, cellulose, and xylose, and potentially a variety of other carbon substrates using laccases, cellulases, and xylanases, as has been reported for other G. thermoleovorans strains isolated from various natural environments (19, 23,–27).; Selected G. thermoleovorans isolates from the lignin, cellulose, and xylose plates were further incubated in liquid cultures with 0.5 g/L of the corresponding carbon substrate, at 70°C (pH 8.5), under aerobic conditions.;  In the lignin cultures, the O2 concentration decreased from 20% to between 15 and 5%, while the CO2 concentration increased to 1 to 4% of the headspace content after 2 weeks of cell growth (Fig. 3A).;  Selected G. thermoleovorans colonies isolated from the Five Sisters 2 (FS2) and Treefall (TF) springs exhibited distinct gas profiles during culture on the lignin substrate, potentially indicating level of variability, or different growth performances or metabolic processes (Fig. 3A).; Headspace oxygen and carbon dioxide content (%) measured over time by GC in the lignin cultures containing G. thermoleovorans isolates from FS2 (squares) and TF (triangles) thermoalkaline springs, compared to the noninoculated controls (crosses).;  The assays were incubated with lignin (A), cellulose (B), and xylose (C) powders as the only carbon source (0.5 g/L, i.e., 5 mg initial content) at 75°C and pH 8, with air in the headspace.;  The dashed lines in the lignin assays represent two different isolates from each spring.;  Specific isolates (from Fig. 2) used in this experiment include: TF L C1 (full line), TF L C3 (dotted line), FS2 L C1 (full line), and another isolate (dotted line) from FS2 (lignin) that was not sequenced due to poor sequence quality; TF C C2 and FS2 C C5 (cellulose); and TF X C1 and FS2 X C1 (xylose).; When plotting oxygen consumption versus corresponding carbon dioxide production as the percent difference between the initial and final headspace content of these gases for each incubation period (i.e., before and after air exchange), we observed a generally linear relationship with good correlations (0.918 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.992) for cell cultures grown on lignin or xylose (see Fig.;  Comparatively, the lignin (slope = 0.28) and cellulose (slope = 0.32) polymers presented lower CO2/O2 ratios (see Fig.;  For these measurements, an initial amount of 5 mg of lignin, cellulose, or xylose was added to each culture as the only carbon source.;  The lignin cultures contained an initial amount of 3 mg of oxygen corresponding to 20% of O2 (air) in the headspace, and no air exchange was performed over 26 days of incubation.;  This indicates that the lignin biomass may have undergone physical changes, such as solubilization, under these mild thermoalkaline conditions, where O2 becomes dissolved in the liquid phase and bound to the organic matter, as previously observed on lignocellulosic waste substrates like sugarcane bagasse (12).;  Indeed, a comparable solid/liquid ratio of 1:10 (wt/vol) at 70°C under mild alkaline conditions allowed partial solubilization of lignin and hemicelluloses into oligomers (12).; When visually examining the culture tubes during the experiments, the formation of a biofilm structure was observed in some of the G. thermoleovorans microbial incubations grown on lignin (see Fig.;  The noninoculated culture sample revealed the complex structure of the lignin matrix only (Fig. 4A).;  The lignin polymer branches were measured to be 300 to 600 nm long and 20 to 40 nm wide, forming a loosely compacted matrix with a varying intermolecular space.;  The inoculated sample included rod-shaped G. thermoleovorans cells, 0.5 μm wide and 4 μm long, which appeared to be physically connected (Fig. 4B) and surrounding the lignin matrix, possibly embedded within secreted exopolymeric substances.; FE-SEM images obtained from the incubations at 70°C and pH 8.5 with lignin as the only carbon source. (A) Lignin matrix in the abiotic control (Mag = 49.13 KX, WD = 4.8 mm, EHT = 1.00 kV). (B) Formation of a biofilm on the lignin matrix by G. thermoleovorans cells of the TF L C1 isolate from Fig. 2 (Mag = 20.30 KX, WD = 5.1 mm, EHT = 1.00 kV).; In the G. thermoleovorans cultures incubated with lignin, the observed biofilm structures varied in size and were comprised of relatively small (2 to 4 mm wide) or larger (4 to 6 mm wide) floating clumps of G. thermoleovorans cells (see Fig.;  When we compared the metabolic activities of the isolate phenotypes in the lignin enrichments, we observed that the presence of a biofilm correlated predominantly with higher O2 consumption and higher CO2 production (see Table S3).;  In the absence of a biofilm, the isolates exhibited lower O2 consumption, with concentrations remaining above 12% in the headspace, and a lower CO2 production of ≤2%. We postulate that the different phenotypes (i.e., biofilm versus free-floating) of the G. thermoleovorans isolates may influence their metabolic activities, when lignin was the sole carbon source and the cells were grown at 70°C and pH 8.5.;  The formation of a biofilm around the lignin matrix has beneficial implications for enhancing depolymerization of lignocellulosic waste, since it might improve enzyme accessibility to substrate and the cleavage of molecular bonds.;  However, due to biological heterogeneity, different responses could be observed between replicate cultures; thus, additional experiments are needed to fully investigate whether biofilm formation is required for lignin degradation.; Extracted metabolites from G. thermoleovorans grown aerobically in a minimal salt medium containing either glucose or lignin as sole carbon source (see Table S5) were analyzed using one-dimensional (1D) 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Table 3; see also Tables S3 and S4).;  The 1D 1H NMR spectra of intracellular polar metabolite mixtures extracted from G. thermoleovorans cell pellets grown on glucose or lignin as the sole carbon source (Tables 3 and ​and4,4, Fig. 5A and ​andB)B) were recorded and analyzed.;  Cells grown on glucose resulted in significantly stronger 1H NMR signals and yielded a larger number of metabolite identifications compared to the 1H NMR spectra recorded on the intracellular polar metabolite mixtures from cells grown on lignin (Table 4, Fig. 5C and ​andD).D).;  This difference is in all likelihood due to the growth advantage of culturing G. thermoleovorans on glucose as the sole carbon source as opposed to the complex lignin polymer (see Table S5).;  In contrast, only 13 polar intracellular and 9 extracellular metabolites could be unambiguously identified from the cell cultures that were grown with lignin (Table 4).;  Although these differences identified metabolite numbers between the two different cell cultures are most likely due to G. thermoleovorans growing better in the presence glucose as the sole carbon source compared to lignin (as assessed by headspace GC measurements; see Table S6), several observable NMR signals could not be attributed to specific metabolites, as reference spectra were not available in the Chenomx database used for metabolite annotation.; Representative 1D 1H NMR spectra of intracellular metabolite mixtures extracted from G. thermoleovorans cell cultures (isolate TF L C1, Fig. 2), grown aerobically at 70°C and pH 8.5 in minimal salt media with glucose (1 g/L) or lignin (1 g/L) as the sole carbon source, recorded on MSU’s 600-MHz solution NMR spectrometer.;  NMR signals assigned to specific signals are abbreviated as follows: DSS, sodium salt of 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid. (A and C) Representative 1D 1H NMR spectra of intracellular metabolites extracted from Geobacillus cell cultures grown on glucose (A) or lignin (C) as the sole carbon source.; Average concentrations of metabolites in intracellular and extracellular fractions, identified and quantified by NMR, that are common to G. thermoleovorans cell cultures grown in the presence of glucose or lignina; Concentrations of metabolites, identified and quantified by NMR, extracted from 500-ml G. thermoleovorans cell cultures and grown in the presence of lignin as the sole carbon source at 70°C and pH 8.5a; Several identified metabolites were found to be common to G. thermoleovorans grown in the presence of glucose and lignin, and included acetate, formate, fumarate, lactate, pyruvate, and succinate (Table 3).;  Of particular interest when comparing the concentrations of these metabolites in the lignin versus glucose cell cultures, the majority of these shared intracellular metabolites were present in larger amounts for cell cultures grown on lignin (acetate, formate, fumarate, pyruvate, etc.).;  This trend is opposite to the extracellular metabolites present in the spent medium with lignin versus glucose (Table 3).;  This supports that G. thermoleovorans growing on lignin is less metabolically active than when grown in the presence of glucose as the sole carbon source.;  A potentially interesting identified metabolite observed in intracellular metabolite extracts under both conditions included syringate, whose level was found to be 3-fold higher with lignin as the sole carbon source.;  Syringate is an intermediate of lignin degradation, and its further degradation leads to production of pyruvate and oxaloacetate, which are key intermediates of several metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation, amino acid metabolism, and others (32, 33).;  Another interesting compound, 4-hydroxybenzoate, was also detected when G. thermoleovorans was cultured with lignin instead of glucose. 4-Hydroxybenzoate is an aromatic metabolite product of alkaline lignin degradation through the benzoic acid pathway (34), a model lignin compound that can be further converted by bacteria (35).; In a first experiment, representative lignin-degrading G. thermoleovorans isolates from TF spring and one from FS2 spring were incubated in liquid cultures in the presence of lignin (0.5 g/L) as the only carbon source at pH 8.5, 70°C, with air present in the headspace.;  These analyses revealed that metabolites such as a carbohydrate, a lipid, a tannin compound, a lignin-rich molecule, and/or a carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecule (CRAM) were found in higher levels in the FS strain.;  Comparatively, the levels of two lipids and of a lignin-rich metabolite (and/or a CRAM) were higher in the TF strain (Fig. 6A).; Heat maps showing small molecule features measured via LC-MS in liquid cultures with the greatest power to differentiate cultures. (A) G. thermoleovorans isolates from TF (TF L C1; Fig. 2) and FS2 (FS2 L C1; Fig. 2) springs grown on lignin (0.5 g/L) at pH 8 and 70°C.;  The colored boxes highlight the main classes of compounds identified in the samples. (B) G. thermoleovorans from FS2 spring (isolate FS2 L C1, Fig. 2) grown on lignin (0.5 g/L) at pH 7 or 9 and at 60 or 70°C for 13 days.; In a second experiment, a lignin-degrading G. thermoleovorans isolate from FS2 spring was incubated in the presence of lignin (0.5 g/L) as the only carbon source in aerobic cultures (Fig. 6B).;  H:C and O:C ratios were then used to fit compounds in macromolecule classes such as condensed carbohydrates, lignin-rich molecules and/or CRAMs, lipids, and proteins.;  In the 60°C and pH 7 samples, a condensed carbohydrate, lignin-rich molecule and/or CRAM compound, and two lipids were in higher concentration relative to the other culture conditions.;  One lignin-rich molecule and/or CRAM compound was also determined to be at a low concentration in a 60°C and pH 7 culture, while being in higher concentration in all other culture conditions (Fig. 6B).;  Geobacillus thermoleovorans strains from thermoalkaline springs in YNP were isolated using lignin, cellulose, or xylose as sole carbon sources.;  In the presence of lignin as the sole carbon substrate, G. thermoleovorans formed biofilm structures that surrounded the complex lignin matrix, and this biofilm phenotype was found to correlate with increased CO2 production under the growth conditions tested in this study.;  The NMR metabolomics studies demonstrated that significant metabolic adaptations take place when G. thermoleovorans is grown on glucose versus lignin as the sole carbon source.;  G. thermoleovorans appeared to be less metabolically active when grown with lignin as the sole carbon source; however, the presence of intracellular syringate suggests that the organism was using lignin as an energy source.;  Overall, the G. thermoleovorans isolates obtained from thermoalkaline springs in YNP demonstrate bioconversion of lignin and cellulose and may represent promising candidates for the valorization of LCB.;  In this study, fallen trees in the spring provided visual signs of biomass degradation in the water, characterized by white stringy remnants enriched in cellulose and depleted in lignin (15), compared to the second spring which was devoid of immersed tree branches (see Table S1).; Liquid enrichments in the presence of purified lignin, cellulose, or xylose as sole carbon sources were performed to grow and isolate thermoalkaline lignocellulose-degrading microbial colonies.;  Purified lignin (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL), cellulose (Acros Organics, Morris Plains, NJ), and xylose (Acros Organics) powders were used as the only carbon source at a final concentration of 0.5 g/L in liquid plate assays throughout the study.;  The purity of the commercial lignin was assessed via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), using standard methods for determination of carbohydrate and lignin content of biomass (39, 40).;  Briefly, the commercial lignin powder was submitted to an alkaline pretreatment and then solubilized by Cu-catalyzed alkaline hydrogen peroxide treatment for depolymerization to aromatic monomers, which were then quantified by HPLC (Agilent 1260 Series).;  No carbohydrates were detected in the commercial powder used in this study (see Table S1), confirming that lignin was the only carbon source provided to the cells.;  Selected isolates from lignin, cellulose, or xylose-containing cell culture plates were transferred to triplicate liquid culture samples in Hungate tubes containing 10 ml of growth media prepared with corresponding carbon substrates (0.5 g/L, air headspace), followed by incubation at thermoalkaline conditions, i.e., pH 8.5 and 70°C, in a cell culture oven.; The headspace gas content (O2, CO2, H2, N2, CO) of the cultures containing lignin, cellulose, and xylose as the only carbon sources, as well as the cell-free and carbon-free negative controls, was assessed over time using gas chromatography (GC).; In some of the thermoalkaline lignin incubations, the G. thermoleovorans cells appeared to aggregate as a floating biofilm.; Cultures (500 ml) of the isolated G. thermoleovorans with either glucose or lignin (0.5 g/L) as the only carbon source were set up in parallel to characterize the production of extracellular and intracellular metabolite and proteins.;  Cell cultures were inoculated with G. thermoleovorans collected from a lignin cell culture plate and incubated at 70°C and pH 8.5 until the liquid microbial cultures reached exponential phase of growth, as indicated by headspace CO2 concentrations monitored via GC (8 days for the glucose assays and 38 days for the lignin assays).;  The internal (0.25 mM) DSS standard was used for metabolite quantitation, and intracellular and extracellular metabolite concentrations were further normalized to protein content to account for biomass differences between cell cultures grown on glucose versus lignin.;  In the presence of lignin (0.5 g/L) as the only carbon source, selected G. thermoleovorans isolates from FS2 and TF springs were incubated in liquid cultures (10 ml [final volume in Hungate tubes]) at 70°C and pH 8.5."
"carbon","D002244",34669438,8752141," Organisms that can use lignin and cellulose as a sole carbon source at 60 to 75°C were isolated from sediment slurry of thermoalkaline hot springs (71 to 81°C and pH 8 to 9) of Yellowstone National Park.;  Assessment of metabolite level changes in two Geobacillus isolates from two representative springs were undertaken to characterize the metabolic responses associated with growth on glucose versus lignin carbon source as a function of pH and temperature.;  These isolates grew on lignocellulosic substrates as sole carbon sources, which they mineralized into carbon dioxide over time.;  Some G. thermoleovorans isolates displayed a particular phenotype in the presence of lignin as the sole carbon source, forming a biofilm structure that was not observed when grown on cellulose or xylose.;  By further characterizing and identifying cellular metabolites produced by these organisms when grown on different carbon sources (e.g., lignin versus glucose) across a range of pH and temperature conditions, we have begun to characterize specific features of their metabolic responses.; Following successive streaking on agar plates containing purified lignin, cellulose, or xylose as the only carbon source, cell cultures were incubated at 60°C for 10 days, facilitating the isolation of distinct lignocellulose-degrading microbial colonies with diverse morphologies (see Fig.;  When collecting the colonies by gentle scraping of the plates, these isolates appeared to be brown in color, irrespective of the type of carbon substrate employed for cell growth.;  Representative isolates for each thermoalkaline spring and each lignocellulosic substrate were streaked on corresponding carbon plates to obtain uniform colonies, which were selected for full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Sanger, Table 2).; We hypothesized that the fallen tree spring, containing indigenous recalcitrant carbon sources, hosted microbial populations capable of metabolizing complex carbon substrates.;  The phylogenetic tree does not reveal any correlation between the clustering of the isolates and the type of carbon substrate used, or the geothermal spring from which they were isolated (Fig. 2), indicating that G. thermoleovorans is ubiquitous in these springs over a range of temperatures (70 to 80°C) and alkaline pH (8.4 to 8.5) (Fig. 1 and Table 1).;  While this does not support our hypothesis that the Treefall spring specifically hosts a microbial population capable of degradation complex carbon substrates, the close sequence similarity of these different G. thermoleovorans strains suggests that they might be capable of degrading lignin, cellulose, and xylose, and potentially a variety of other carbon substrates using laccases, cellulases, and xylanases, as has been reported for other G. thermoleovorans strains isolated from various natural environments (19, 23,–27).; Selected G. thermoleovorans isolates from the lignin, cellulose, and xylose plates were further incubated in liquid cultures with 0.5 g/L of the corresponding carbon substrate, at 70°C (pH 8.5), under aerobic conditions.;  The headspace gas content was measured by GC over time in all of the cultures and compared to the noninoculated controls for each carbon substrate (Fig. 3).; Headspace oxygen and carbon dioxide content (%) measured over time by GC in the lignin cultures containing G. thermoleovorans isolates from FS2 (squares) and TF (triangles) thermoalkaline springs, compared to the noninoculated controls (crosses).;  The assays were incubated with lignin (A), cellulose (B), and xylose (C) powders as the only carbon source (0.5 g/L, i.e., 5 mg initial content) at 75°C and pH 8, with air in the headspace.; After the gas content had stabilized (Fig. 3B and ​andC),C), the headspace of the cultures grown on cellulose or xylose as the only carbon source were exchanged with filtered air to replenish oxygen.; When plotting oxygen consumption versus corresponding carbon dioxide production as the percent difference between the initial and final headspace content of these gases for each incubation period (i.e., before and after air exchange), we observed a generally linear relationship with good correlations (0.918 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.992) for cell cultures grown on lignin or xylose (see Fig.;  For these measurements, an initial amount of 5 mg of lignin, cellulose, or xylose was added to each culture as the only carbon source.; FE-SEM images obtained from the incubations at 70°C and pH 8.5 with lignin as the only carbon source.

 Specifically, extracellular concentrations of formate, fumarate, and lactate were found to be higher in the spent medium of cells grown in the presence of glucose as the sole carbon source.;  This supports that G. thermoleovorans growing on lignin is less metabolically active than when grown in the presence of glucose as the sole carbon source.;  A potentially interesting identified metabolite observed in intracellular metabolite extracts under both conditions included syringate, whose level was found to be 3-fold higher with lignin as the sole carbon source.;

In a second experiment, a lignin-degrading G. thermoleovorans isolate from FS2 spring was incubated in the presence of lignin (0.5 g/L) as the only carbon source in aerobic cultures (Fig. 6B).;  This allowed for chemical formula generation and the determination of hydrogen to carbon and oxygen to carbon ratios.; In this study, we hypothesized that high temperature alkaline geothermal springs (temperature 72 to 85°C and pH 8 to 9) containing endogenous and recalcitrant carbon sources (e.g., plant biomass and humic acids), host thermophile populations with high potentials for metabolizing complex carbons substrates.;  Geobacillus thermoleovorans strains from thermoalkaline springs in YNP were isolated using lignin, cellulose, or xylose as sole carbon sources.;  Regardless of a visible carbon input in the spring, e.g., in the form of a fallen tree in the TF spring, the microbial isolates were found to be closely related based on phylogenetic identification.;  Results from our study demonstrate that these G. thermoleovorans isolates could metabolize different lignocellulose substrates as the sole carbon source when grown in liquid cultures and mineralize the organic substrate to CO2.;

(A and C) Representative 1D 1H NMR spectra of intracellular metabolites extracted from Geobacillus cell cultures grown on glucose (A) or lignin (C) as the sole carbon source.; Average concentrations of metabolites in intracellular and extracellular fractions, identified and quantified by NMR, that are common to G. thermoleovorans cell cultures grown in the presence of glucose or lignina; Several identified metabolites were found to be common to G. thermoleovorans grown in the presence of glucose and lignin, and included acetate, formate, fumarate, lactate, pyruvate, and succinate (Table 3).;  Of particular interest when comparing the concentrations of these metabolites in the lignin versus glucose cell cultures, the majority of these shared intracellular metabolites were present in larger amounts for cell cultures grown on lignin (acetate, formate, fumarate, pyruvate, etc.).;  This trend is opposite to the extracellular metabolites present in the spent medium with lignin versus glucose (Table 3).;  Specifically, extracellular concentrations of formate, fumarate, and lactate were found to be higher in the spent medium of cells grown in the presence of glucose as the sole carbon source.;  This supports that G. thermoleovorans growing on lignin is less metabolically active than when grown in the presence of glucose as the sole carbon source.;  Another interesting compound, 4-hydroxybenzoate, was also detected when G. thermoleovorans was cultured with lignin instead of glucose. 4-Hydroxybenzoate is an aromatic metabolite product of alkaline lignin degradation through the benzoic acid pathway (34), a model lignin compound that can be further converted by bacteria (35).;  The NMR metabolomics studies demonstrated that significant metabolic adaptations take place when G. thermoleovorans is grown on glucose versus lignin as the sole carbon source.; Cultures (500 ml) of the isolated G. thermoleovorans with either glucose or lignin (0.5 g/L) as the only carbon source were set up in parallel to characterize the production of extracellular and intracellular metabolite and proteins.;  Cell cultures were inoculated with G. thermoleovorans collected from a lignin cell culture plate and incubated at 70°C and pH 8.5 until the liquid microbial cultures reached exponential phase of growth, as indicated by headspace CO2 concentrations monitored via GC (8 days for the glucose assays and 38 days for the lignin assays).;  The internal (0.25 mM) DSS standard was used for metabolite quantitation, and intracellular and extracellular metabolite concentrations were further normalized to protein content to account for biomass differences between cell cultures grown on glucose versus lignin."

With ectoine and hydroxyectoine, the major variation after 24 h storage at 4 °C for the protected and unprotected soaked samples lies within the samples and no clear separation is observed in the first principal component (PC).11,12 Further PCs did not separate the protected samples from the denatured ones coated by soaking (cf.;  Subsequently, separation of protected and unprotected samples was possible in the case of ectoine and a trend was observed in the case of hydroxyectoine.;  This indicates that exposure of the protein to ectoine and hydroxyectoine solutions changes the protein orientation or conformation, whereas trehalose does not show this effect.; Samples coated with ectoine [Fig. 5(a)] by the drop-coating method differ from protected and soaking-method coated samples by the following signals, loading positively in PC1 (scores above 0.1; assignments of fragments to amino acids in brackets): m/z 55.02, C3H3O+ (Tyr/ligand); m/z 69.04, C4H5O+ (Thr); m/z 71.01, C3H3O2+ (Ser); m/z 72.08, C4H10N+ (Val); m/z 82.05, C4H6N2+ (His); m/z 107.05, C7H7O+ (Tyr); m/z 110.09, C5H8N3+ (His, Arg); and m/z 136.08, C8H10NO+ (Tyr).; Hydroxyectoine coated samples differ to a less significant extent [Fig. 5(b)], and a clear separation cannot be reached even with the drop-coating method.;  The overlap between sample types indicates that even a short exposure to hydroxyectoine can influence the protein conformation.;  The loadings suggest that the drop-coated samples contain even more of the outer shell components of HRP than the protected ones, indicating a fast reorientation process upon contact with hydroxyectoine solution.;  The scores of the trehalose protected samples show a larger spread than ectoine or hydroxyectoine protected ones, which may be related to the less homogeneous distribution of trehalose over the HRP surface (cf.; The contact time of unprotected HRP and (aqueous) ectoine solution has a significant influence on the amino acids exposed at the protein surface.;  Thus, additionally, the ABTS activity assay was performed on unprotected coatings stored for 24 h at 4 °C, both soaked in ectoine solution (30 or 60 min) and drop-coated with a solute (Fig.;  This indicates that the protein structure may change back to exposing the more hydrophilic domains upon immersion in aqueous ectoine or hydroxyectoine solution; however, the correct folding of the enzyme does not seem to be achieved.; The findings of this project show that ectoine and hydroxyectoine are most efficient for keeping a protein coated surface hydrated (hydrophilic amino acids are prevalent on the surface of the protein) and active.;  Due to the latter effect, trehalose coatings are more well-suited for surface analytical investigation of protein denaturation, while the (hydroxy-)ectoine coatings are more promising for application in the dry storage of protein modified devices.; In the present work, we investigate the stabilization of dried protein coatings on solid supports by the compatible solutes ectoine, hydroxyectoine, and the sugar trehalose.;  The activity of horseradish peroxidase after 24 h dry storage at 4 °C coated with ectoine and hydroxyectoine was comparable to freshly dried, unprotected protein surfaces.; Ectoine and hydroxyectoine coated protein surfaces were furthermore shown to contain a higher amount of disulfide bonds than trehalose protected surfaces.;  Comparing the ToF-SIMS spectra of protected and unprotected HRP indicates that a rehydration of denatured protein is possible with ectoine and hydroxyectoine, whereas no change of the protein conformation was observed for trehalose coatings.;  Hydroxyectoine and ectoine produce very homogeneous coatings on protein monolayers and hydrate the latter efficiently, allowing for longer periods of dry storage of protein coated surfaces."

"water","D014867",29958498,6026024," The protective effect can be explained by the preferred exclusion model; i.e., the solutes trap a thin water layer around the protein, retaining an aqueous environment and preventing unfolding of the protein.;  The compatible solutes do not directly interact with the protein structure; i.e., they stabilize by not binding to the proteins but by trapping water between the protein and themselves.;  Recently, Wolkers et al. were able to show trehalose induced water retention at the biomolecule surface upon drying by infrared spectroscopy.24 Ectoines have already found application as cell protectants in skin care and as protein-free stabilizers of proteins and cells in life sciences.25;  All organic solvents were of water-free grade.; Ti (100 nm) was sputtered onto a silica wafer in a Createc SP-P-US-6M-3Z UHV instrument, ultrasonically cleaned in ethanol and deionized (DI) water, and anodized at 20 V for 2 min in 1 mol/l H2SO4 (Merck), and a Pt sheet was used as a counter electrode.;  All samples were rinsed with DI water after the anodization process and then cleaned by exposure to UV light for at least 30 min (while being completely immersed in DI water)32 to photocatalytically remove contaminations and subsequently dried under a stream of N2.;  Samples were rinsed according to Foster et al.33 Subsequently, they were coated with 75 μl of a 26 mmol/l solute solution in DI water for 30 min, according to Xia et al.11 Finally, samples were spin-dried at 3000 rpm for 30 s and stored for the respective times at either RT or in a fridge (4 °C).;  To minimize artifacts by protein dissolution into the solute solution, references for the activity assay were prepared by coating the samples with 75 μl of DI water.;  Water contact angles were measured with droplets of 10 μl DI water and recorded with a Leica DFC295 digital camera using the leica application suite 3.7.0 software.;  The absence of the solute molecules in the spectra is in agreement with the “preferential exclusion model”;21–23 i.e., the small molecules seem not to stabilize the protein by direct interaction, but a solute stabilized water shell may be encapsulating the protein."
"salt","D012492",35137260,8825391," Our understanding of the biological effects of salt composition diversity is limited; therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of different anions on the growth of halophilic bacteria.;  Accordingly, the salt composition and concentration preference of 172 strains isolated from saline and soda lakes that differed in ionic composition was tested using media containing either carbonate, chloride or sulfate as anion in concentration values ranging from 0 to 0.40 mol/L.;  Differences in salt-type preference among bacterial strains were observed in relationship to the salt composition of the natural habitat they were isolated from indicating specific salt-type adaptation.;  Our results suggest that the extent of the effect of dissolved salts in saline lakes is not limited to their concentration but the type of anion also substantially impacts the growth and survival of individual microorganisms.;  Endorheic lakes are filled with precipitation water, groundwater and runoff from the surrounding land but due to the lack of outflow, water loss happens only through evaporation, which leaves behind the dissolved salts (Wetzel 2001; Tundisi and Tundisi 2012).; In terms of salt concentration and ionic composition, saline lakes may differ significantly from each other (Waiser and Robarts 2009; Boros and Kolpakova 2018).;  Saline waters can be characterized by the amount of eight major ions dissolved in the water: Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3−, CO32−, Cl− and SO42−. Similarly to the salt concentration, chemical composition of the salts is also primarily determined by the mineral composition of the drainage basin.;  Furthermore, due to the evaporation induced concentration increases, certain types of salts may precipitate, while others remain in solution further modifying the ionic composition.;  The first salt to precipitate is typically lime (CaCO3), followed by dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2], then gypsum (CaSO4 × H2O), and finally other salts (Waiser and Robarts 2009; Schagerl 2016).; The concentration of different salts also affects other physicochemical properties of the lake water, e.g., with increasing salt concentration, the oxygen solubility and the freezing point of the water decreases, while density increases; and dissolved salts can also modulate the amount of available nutrients (Williams and Sherwood 1994; Shadrin 2018).;  However, salt concentration and composition also directly affect aquatic organisms.;  Simultaneously, bacteria due to their unicellular nature are particularly sensitive to osmotic and ionic changes making salt concentration and ionic composition a particularly important selective force modifying abundance, composition and activity of aquatic microbial communities (Székely and Langenheder 2014; Banciu and Muntyan 2015; Gunde-Cimerman et al. 2018; Menéndez-Serra et al. 2021).;  Despite the obvious importance of diverse ions in general cellular processes (Rosenberg et al. 2013), salinity tolerance studies usually focus only on the effect of overall salt concentration, which is mainly regarded as NaCl, or salinity and its values are estimated based on in situ measurements of electric conductivity.;  To achieve this, growth tests were performed using media with different salt concentration values and ionic compositions on bacterial strains that were isolated from three sets of saline lakes that differed in ionic composition (Fig. 1): (1) two soda lakes located in Kiskunság (Hungary, Central Europe), characterized by high sodium hydrogen carbonate content (Boros et al. 2014); (2) two soda lakes in Vojvodina (Serbia, Central/Southeast Europe) with approximately equal proportion of sodium hydrogen carbonate, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate (Boros et al. 2014); and (3) two Transylvanian saline lakes (Romania, Eastern Europe), which are dominated by sodium chloride (Borsodi et al. 2013; Máthé et al. 2014; Andrei et al. 2015; Felföldi et al. 2016).; Salt composition of the lake water from where the strains were isolated and the media used in the salt tolerance test.;  Dissolved salts are shown in molar ratio.; Before the salt tolerance tests, strains were transferred and grown in liquid media that had the same composition as the solid media used for their maintenance (Table S1).; The salt tolerance tests were performed using nutrient-based (DSMZ medium 1, www.dsmz.de) media containing sodium chloride, sodium hydrogen carbonate and sodium carbonate or sodium sulfate at different concentration (Table ​(Table1);1); which throughout this study are referred to as ‘chloride’, ‘carbonate’ and ‘sulfate’ media, respectively.;  For each salt treatment, six different concentrations ranging from 0.06 to 0.40 mol/L were applied (Table ​(Table1).1).;  As the commonly used salinity categories according to Hammer (1986) are defined based on mass concentrations (w/v%), most of the applied salt concentrations corresponded to hypo- and mesosaline salinity.;  The only exception was the highest salt concentration treatment used for sulfate, which due to the high molar weight of sodium sulfate corresponded to the hypersaline category.;  In summary, the tests were performed using nutrient broth containing one of the three tested salts and each type of media consisted of a series of eight different salt concentration values.; Mass and molar concentration of salts in the liquid nutrient media used for the salt tolerance tests; Salt tolerance tests were performed in 96-well microtiter plates using 300 μL of salt-containing nutrient medium and 10 μL of bacterial cell suspension.;  Sterile nutrient broth was used as a salt-free control.; In this study a total of 3268 individual salt tolerance measurements have been obtained using 172 bacterial strains grown in 19 different ionic composition and/or salt concentration media (6 carbonate, 6 chloride, 6 sulfate and 1 salt-free nutrient media as control).;  Based on the measured OD values, it can be generally concluded that the members of the studied bacterial collection grew more intensively at salt concentration values higher than the control medium (only 2 strains had their growth maximum in the control medium) (Fig. 3).; Growth intensity of bacterial strains in liquid media containing the three tested salt types in different concentration values based on turbidity data (z-score normalized OD).; Clustering of the growth patterns measured in the salt tolerance test.; The salt preference determined based on the comparison of the weighted growth values of each strain in the three different salts showed that 59% of the strains grew best in sulfate, 33% in chloride and 8% in carbonate media (Table ​(Table2).2).;  Sulfate preferring strains were over-represented among the strains from Kiskunság (i.e., showed a higher ratio than expected based on the salt preference distribution of all strains: 72% of the strains from Kiskunság grew best on sulfate media, while only 59% of all strains), while they were slightly underrepresented among strains from Transylvania and Vojvodina.; The mean weighted growth value of the strains also significantly differed among the three salts (Kruskal–Wallis chi-squared = 135.64, df = 2, p value < 0.001) with the growth in carbonate being substantially lower than in chloride and sulfate and the growth in sulfate being slightly but significantly higher than in chloride (Fig. 5, Table S4).;  Furthermore, the taxonomic affiliation of the strains showed no substantial relationship with their weighted growth value in different anion media as no visible clustering by taxonomy along weighted growth in any salt could be identified (i.e., taxa belonging to the same class could show both high and low weighted growth for the same salt as seen in Fig. 5).; In this study we demonstrated that the salt tolerance of strains isolated from saline lakes with different salt composition depends not only on the concentration of salt in the media but also the anion composition of the salt.;  Namely, the majority of bacterial strains isolated from lakes dominated by chloride, were adapted to grow in media with higher concentrations of chloride, while strains isolated from aquatic systems containing a considerable amount of carbonate salts were adapted to grow with carbonates.; Contrary to most halotolerance studies focusing on the limits of growth, our study investigated growth at less extreme salt concentration values (0.06–0.4 M) such as those characteristic to the soda pans and the upper layers of the saline Transylvanian lakes from, where the studied bacterial strains were isolated.;  More precisely, in moderately saline aquatic habitats and in environments with fluctuating salinity such as those typical for shallow soda pans, microbes are more likely to cope with osmotic stress by applying the energetically more expensive but flexible ‘salt-out’ (’compatible solute’) strategy (i.e., exclusion of salt ions from the cytoplasm with simultaneous accumulation of low molecular weight organic compounds to lower the intracellular water activity and stabilize the hydration shell of proteins) rather than the ‘salt-in’ strategy (accumulation of inorganic salts intracellularly) (Oren 2013a; Gunde-Cimerman et al. 2018; Menéndez-Serra et al. 2021).;  According to the salt tolerance test almost all strains in this study preferred elevated salt concentrations over the control medium and all media used in this study contained complex components (e.g., peptone and meat extract) that most likely included the precursor molecule(s) of glycine betaine biosynthesis (Imhoff and Rodriguez-Valera 1984; Gunde-Cimerman et al. 2018) suggesting that the compatible solute strategy could be a common coping mechanism among our halophilic strains.; Natural and artificial saline aquatic habitats represent an enormous variability of salinity and ionic composition (brackish river estuaries, soda lakes, saltern crystallizer ponds, etc.; Hammer 1986; Waiser and Robarts 2009; Oren 2013a).;  Despite this huge diversity of ionic composition in saline aquatic habitats, most salt adaptation studies focus only on the biological effect of different concentration values of NaCl, making studies like ours, where salt tolerance is explored for salts others than NaCl crucial for the understanding of the selective forces that saline habitats exert on aquatic microbes.; Although organisms living in saline environments with different dominant ions are expected to have different strategies to cope with the unfavorable effects of dissolved ions (Hallsworth et al. 2007; Banciu and Muntyan 2015; Sorokin et al. 2015), the influence of different salts on bacteria has been scarcely studied previously.;  For example, Stevens and Cockell (2020) determined for a single Bacillus subtilis strain in eight different salts the highest molar concentration, where growth could be still detected.;  Waajen et al. (2020) also indicated that anion properties were among the most important parameters that affected the survival of a Planococcus halocryophilus strain at extremely low temperature values when comparing brine solutions of nine different salts, while Banciu et al. (2004) observed higher biomass yield of a Thialkalivibrio halophilus strain in NaCl than in Na2CO3, and hypothesized that the adaptation to high salinities could, at least partly, be explained with differences in the osmotic pressure caused by these salts at equal sodium ion concentration (4 M).;  Contrary to these experiments performed on individual bacterial strains, to the best of our knowledge, systematic study on the effect of different dissolved ions on a large set of bacteria isolated from different saline lakes like ours (i.e., 172 bacterial strains isolated from 6 different lakes in 3 different regions and tested on 3 different salts) has not been carried out before.;  We have to emphasize that as high concentration of dissolved Na-carbonates increases pH, to avoid the potential confounding effect of varying pH, all salt tolerance tests were performed under alkaline conditions (pH ~ 9.0), Still, carbonate had the most substantial effect on the growth, as on average the strains showed significantly poorer growth in these media than in chloride or sulfate indicating widespread maladaptation to carbonate.;  Meanwhile, on average the strains grew best in the sulfate media and except for a slight over-representation of sulfate preference among the strains isolated from Kiskunság, no regional differences could be detected for this salt.; Overall bacterial strain collections isolated from all sites showed a broad range of salt adaptation.;  For example, strains from the two soda lake regions showed growth at diverse concentrations of all three tested salts, while the strains from Transylvania, although they grew mostly poorly in carbonate media, had a wide optimum range for chloride and sulfate.;  The salt concentration of the soda pans in the Carpathian Basin usually varies between 1 and 20 g/L with substantial seasonal variability and occasional extremes as high as 70 g/L (Boros et al. 2014, 2017).;  The broad and diverse salt tolerance among the strains of each habitat suggests that the local microbial communities are well-adapted and resilient to the inherent environmental variation of the source lakes.; It should be mentioned that there was an association between the observed differences in salt tolerance and the taxonomic affiliation of the strains.; Meanwhile, interspecies variability in response to salt stress was also observed with strains of the same species exhibiting different traits.;  For example, the 9 strains of Bacillus alkalisediminis isolated from Zab-szék in Kiskunság clustered into the three different clusters on the heatmap and among them all three salt preferences types could be identified (i.e., carbonate, chloride and sulfate).;  The existence of high diversity of salt preference and tolerance within each class was also evident based on the weighted growth comparisons, while similar traits were identified in taxonomically distant taxa as indicated by the occurrence of natronophily in all six classes present among the strains of this study.; Our study demonstrated that the analysis of the effect of low to medium salinity stress exerted by different sodium salts (carbonate, chloride, and sulfate) can reveal rich, origin-dependent diversity in bacterial adaptation that studies testing salt tolerance and adaptation only to sodium chloride at high concentrations mostly overlook.;  The results of our study, similar to the conclusions of previous studies based on the analysis of single strains, corroborated the idea that salinity tolerance is not only salt concentration dependent but it is also greatly influenced by the anion type of the given salt.;  More precisely, we concluded that in general sodium carbonate salts pose a selective force that impact bacteria more substantially than the other tested salts and to which only few, so called natronophilic microorganisms are adapted.;  Furthermore, we found that while sulfate tolerance was widespread among strains isolated from different saline sources, in general, growth intensity in media with different concentrations of different salts was related to the origin and to some extent the taxonomy of the strains.; Conceptualization: AB, AJS, BC, and TF; funding acquisition: AJS, BC, and TF; Investigation: sample collection and determination of environmental parameters: AB, BC, and EB; strain isolation and maintenance: AB, BC, and IM; salt tolerance tests: AB, HN, and TF; methodology: AB, AJS, BC, and TF; supervision: AJS, BC, and TF; visualization: AB, AJS, BC, and TF; writing—original draft: AB, AJS, BC, and TF; writing—review and editing: AB, AJS, BC, EB, HN, IM, and TF."

"saline","D012965",35137260,8825391,"Beside sodium chloride, inland saline aquatic systems often contain other anions than chloride such as hydrogen carbonate and sulfate.;  Accordingly, the salt composition and concentration preference of 172 strains isolated from saline and soda lakes that differed in ionic composition was tested using media containing either carbonate, chloride or sulfate as anion in concentration values ranging from 0 to 0.40 mol/L.;  Our results suggest that the extent of the effect of dissolved salts in saline lakes is not limited to their concentration but the type of anion also substantially impacts the growth and survival of individual microorganisms.; According to a conventional definition, saline lakes have a salinity of at least 3 g/L (Williams 1996).;  Inland saline lakes occur on every continent (Hammer 1986; Sorokin et al. 2014; Waiser and Robarts 2009), and their total number and volume on Earth is comparable to that of all freshwater lakes (Williams 1993; Lerman 2009).;  Athalassic saline lakes, that have not been connected to marine systems in geologically recent times, are globally widely distributed (De Wit 2016).;  For example, shallow saline lakes are particularly exposed to the effect of precipitation and evaporation induced water level fluctuation with droughts leading to drastic increases in salinity and even periodical complete desiccation (Hammer 1986; Waiser and Robarts 2009; Schagerl 2016; Szabó et al. 2020), while unrestricted water withdrawals from the watershed (e.g., irrigation) can also cause increases in salinity (Liu et al. 2020).; In terms of salt concentration and ionic composition, saline lakes may differ significantly from each other (Waiser and Robarts 2009; Boros and Kolpakova 2018).;  In the case of soda lakes, high concentration of dissolved carbonates increases pH and serves as a buffer creating a permanently alkaline character for the saline lake (Wetzel 2001; Boros and Kolpakova 2018).;  Therefore, most saline waters have a predominance of Na+, and there are only a few lakes dominated by Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations.;  However, there is a remarkable diversity in the case of anions: although Cl− anion dominates in most saline lakes, soda lakes are dominated by HCO3− and CO32−, while SO42− is also present in many saline lakes at relatively high concentration values (Wetzel 2001; Boros and Kolpakova 2018).;  Hence, bacterioplankton play an essential role in the biochemical processes in saline aquatic habitats (Pedrós-Alió et al. 2000; Waiser and Robarts 2009; Schagerl 2016; Felföldi 2020).; The aim of this study was to determine the effect of different concentrations of three anions (i.e., CO32− + HCO3−, Cl− and SO42−) common to saline lakes on bacterial strains isolated from such lakes.;  To achieve this, growth tests were performed using media with different salt concentration values and ionic compositions on bacterial strains that were isolated from three sets of saline lakes that differed in ionic composition (Fig. 1): (1) two soda lakes located in Kiskunság (Hungary, Central Europe), characterized by high sodium hydrogen carbonate content (Boros et al. 2014); (2) two soda lakes in Vojvodina (Serbia, Central/Southeast Europe) with approximately equal proportion of sodium hydrogen carbonate, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate (Boros et al. 2014); and (3) two Transylvanian saline lakes (Romania, Eastern Europe), which are dominated by sodium chloride (Borsodi et al. 2013; Máthé et al. 2014; Andrei et al. 2015; Felföldi et al. 2016).; The bacterial strains used in this study were isolated from water samples collected from Zab-szék and Sós-ér soda pans located in Kiskunság (Hungary) on October 18, 2016, and from water samples collected from Rusanda soda pan and Slano Kopovo soda-saline pan (according to the classification Boros and Kolpakova 2018) in Vojvodina (Serbia) on May 17, 2018.;  Bacterial strains isolated from the upper layers of the saline Ursu Lake (Bear Lake) and Roşu Lake (Red Lake) in Transylvania (Romania) were obtained from the culture collection of the Department of Bioengineering, Sapientia Hungarian University of Transylvania (Miercurea Ciuc, Romania).;  As the commonly used salinity categories according to Hammer (1986) are defined based on mass concentrations (w/v%), most of the applied salt concentrations corresponded to hypo- and mesosaline salinity.;  The only exception was the highest salt concentration treatment used for sulfate, which due to the high molar weight of sodium sulfate corresponded to the hypersaline category.; In this study we demonstrated that the salt tolerance of strains isolated from saline lakes with different salt composition depends not only on the concentration of salt in the media but also the anion composition of the salt.; Contrary to most halotolerance studies focusing on the limits of growth, our study investigated growth at less extreme salt concentration values (0.06–0.4 M) such as those characteristic to the soda pans and the upper layers of the saline Transylvanian lakes from, where the studied bacterial strains were isolated.;  The tested salinity levels correspond mostly to hypo- and mesosaline conditions with the only exception of the highest sodium sulfate media that corresponded to hypersaline conditions.;  More precisely, in moderately saline aquatic habitats and in environments with fluctuating salinity such as those typical for shallow soda pans, microbes are more likely to cope with osmotic stress by applying the energetically more expensive but flexible ‘salt-out’ (’compatible solute’) strategy (i.e., exclusion of salt ions from the cytoplasm with simultaneous accumulation of low molecular weight organic compounds to lower the intracellular water activity and stabilize the hydration shell of proteins) rather than the ‘salt-in’ strategy (accumulation of inorganic salts intracellularly) (Oren 2013a; Gunde-Cimerman et al. 2018; Menéndez-Serra et al. 2021).; Natural and artificial saline aquatic habitats represent an enormous variability of salinity and ionic composition (brackish river estuaries, soda lakes, saltern crystallizer ponds, etc.; Hammer 1986; Waiser and Robarts 2009; Oren 2013a).;  Examples of saline systems with non-NaCl dominated ionic composition include soda lakes and ponds (with large amounts of Na-carbonates; Kebede et al. 1994; Boros et al. 2014; Schagerl 2016; Boros and Kolpakova 2018), MgSO4- and CaCl2-brines (Dickson et al. 2013; Fox-Powell and Cockell 2018) and soda lime deposits (mainly with calcium as cation; Kalwasińska et al. 2015, 2019).;  Apart from saline surface waters, aquatic habitats with diverse salinity composition exist also beneath the surface of Earth such as in the deep anoxic brines of the Mediterranean Sea that are almost saturated with MgCl2 (Cita 2006) or the Ca- and K-dominated subsurface saline waters in sedimentary basins (Hanor 1994).;  Furthermore, non-NaCl dominated saline brines exist also on other planetary bodies, e.g., on Europa and Mars (Kargel 2000; Vaniman et al. 2004).;  Despite this huge diversity of ionic composition in saline aquatic habitats, most salt adaptation studies focus only on the biological effect of different concentration values of NaCl, making studies like ours, where salt tolerance is explored for salts others than NaCl crucial for the understanding of the selective forces that saline habitats exert on aquatic microbes.; Although organisms living in saline environments with different dominant ions are expected to have different strategies to cope with the unfavorable effects of dissolved ions (Hallsworth et al. 2007; Banciu and Muntyan 2015; Sorokin et al. 2015), the influence of different salts on bacteria has been scarcely studied previously.;  Contrary to these experiments performed on individual bacterial strains, to the best of our knowledge, systematic study on the effect of different dissolved ions on a large set of bacteria isolated from different saline lakes like ours (i.e., 172 bacterial strains isolated from 6 different lakes in 3 different regions and tested on 3 different salts) has not been carried out before.; Since most natural saline lakes have sodium cation dominance (Hammer 1986; Waiser and Robarts 2009), we focused only on the effect of dissolved anions (namely, chloride, sulfate and carbonates).; The anion-preference and tolerance of the studied strains was related to whether they were isolated from chloride- (Transylvania region: Ursu and Roşu Lake) or carbonate-rich saline lakes (Kiskunság: Zab-szék and Sós-ér; Vojvodina: Rusanda and Slano Kopovo).;  Next, most strikingly the strains isolated from the NaCl-dominated saline lakes that had only negligible proportion (~ 1 e%) of carbonates, grew very poorly on carbonate further corroborating the idea that coping with carbonates requires special physiological adaptation.;  Furthermore, we found that while sulfate tolerance was widespread among strains isolated from different saline sources, in general, growth intensity in media with different concentrations of different salts was related to the origin and to some extent the taxonomy of the strains.;  Understanding the impact of salinity stress caused by different anions on microbial growth and survival is particularly important considering the vast ionic diversity of athalassic saline lakes as well as the expected changes in salinity in such habitats due to climate change intensified evaporation and anthropogenic water withdrawal practices."

which throughout this study are referred to as ‘chloride’, ‘carbonate’ and ‘sulfate’ media, respectively.; To evaluate the differences in the anion preference of the strains, the OD values measured for each strain in the 19 different growth media were z-score normalized, and then the normalized OD values were multiplied by the molar concentration of each medium and summed within ion types to create a weighted growth value for each strain and anion type (i.e., carbonate, chloride and sulfate).;  As anion the Transylvanian lakes have almost exclusively chloride (> 94 e%; with ~ 4 e% sulfate in the deeper regions of Ursu Lake), while the soda pans of the Kiskunság contain ~ 26–27 e% of chloride and ~ 55–65 e% of carbonates (hydrogen carbonate + carbonate).;  Compared to Kiskunság, the soda pans of Vojvodina have lower concentration of carbonates (~ 30–38 e%) and similar or higher values of chloride (29 and 48 e% in Rusanda and Slano Kopovo, respectively).; In this study a total of 3268 individual salt tolerance measurements have been obtained using 172 bacterial strains grown in 19 different ionic composition and/or salt concentration media (6 carbonate, 6 chloride, 6 sulfate and 1 salt-free nutrient media as control).;  Members of cluster 1 grew well in higher concentrations of the sulfate media, showed slight preference of intermediate concentrations of carbonate and grew relatively poorly in chloride media.;  In contrast, the strains in cluster 2 showed poor growth in carbonate media and intensive growth at higher concentrations of chloride and sulfate media.;  Finally, cluster 3 comprised strains that showed the best growth at medium concentrations of chloride and relatively worse growth in carbonate and sulfate media.; The salt preference determined based on the comparison of the weighted growth values of each strain in the three different salts showed that 59% of the strains grew best in sulfate, 33% in chloride and 8% in carbonate media (Table ​(Table2).2).; The mean weighted growth value of the strains also significantly differed among the three salts (Kruskal–Wallis chi-squared = 135.64, df = 2, p value < 0.001) with the growth in carbonate being substantially lower than in chloride and sulfate and the growth in sulfate being slightly but significantly higher than in chloride (Fig. 5, Table S4).;  The growth in the carbonate and chloride media significantly differed also for the strains originating from different regions (Kruskal–Wallis chi-squared = 90.823, df = 2, p value < 0.001, and Kruskal–Wallis chi-squared = 57.529, df = 2, p value < 0.001, respectively).;  The post-hoc analyses by Dunn-test revealed that overall the strains from Kiskunság and Vojvodina grew better in the carbonate media than the strains from Transylvania (Fig. 5, Table S4), while the strains from Transylvania grew better in chloride than those from Vojvodina and Kiskunság, and those from Vojvodina grew also slightly better in chloride than those from Kiskunság (Fig. 5).;  In general, the bacterial strains of Kiskunság and Vojvodina are well-adapted to carbonate, chloride and sulfate, while bacteria isolated from Transylvanian lakes were the least adapted to carbonate, but grew well in the presence of chloride and sulfate.;  Namely, the majority of bacterial strains isolated from lakes dominated by chloride, were adapted to grow in media with higher concentrations of chloride, while strains isolated from aquatic systems containing a considerable amount of carbonate salts were adapted to grow with carbonates.;  Similarly, Fox-Powell and Cockell (2018) observed the shortest doubling times of a Marinococcus strain in sodium and chloride ion containing media.; Since most natural saline lakes have sodium cation dominance (Hammer 1986; Waiser and Robarts 2009), we focused only on the effect of dissolved anions (namely, chloride, sulfate and carbonates).;  We have to emphasize that as high concentration of dissolved Na-carbonates increases pH, to avoid the potential confounding effect of varying pH, all salt tolerance tests were performed under alkaline conditions (pH ~ 9.0), Still, carbonate had the most substantial effect on the growth, as on average the strains showed significantly poorer growth in these media than in chloride or sulfate indicating widespread maladaptation to carbonate.;  According to this nomenclature, only 14 strains in this study were truly natronophiles having higher growth in carbonate than in chloride or sulfate media.; The anion-preference and tolerance of the studied strains was related to whether they were isolated from chloride- (Transylvania region: Ursu and Roşu Lake) or carbonate-rich saline lakes (Kiskunság: Zab-szék and Sós-ér; Vojvodina: Rusanda and Slano Kopovo).;  The strains isolated from the Transylvanian lakes had significantly better growth in chloride than the strains isolated from the carbonate-rich lakes and the NaCl-preferring halophilic strains were also over-represented among them.;  Contrary to this, in our study, the majority of strains irrespective of their site of isolation grew best in the sulfate-containing media and not in chloride.;  For example, strains from the two soda lake regions showed growth at diverse concentrations of all three tested salts, while the strains from Transylvania, although they grew mostly poorly in carbonate media, had a wide optimum range for chloride and sulfate.;  For example, the 9 strains of Bacillus alkalisediminis isolated from Zab-szék in Kiskunság clustered into the three different clusters on the heatmap and among them all three salt preferences types could be identified (i.e., carbonate, chloride and sulfate).; Our study demonstrated that the analysis of the effect of low to medium salinity stress exerted by different sodium salts (carbonate, chloride, and sulfate) can reveal rich, origin-dependent diversity in bacterial adaptation that studies testing salt tolerance and adaptation only to sodium chloride at high concentrations mostly overlook."

All source habitats contained a remarkable amount of sulfate (4–33 e%), which could originate both from decomposing organic matter (e.g., from leaves of surrounding trees or shoreline macrophytes), as well as from dissolution from the bedrock (in the case of Ursu Lake, sulfate concentration increases gradually with depth probably due to the activity of green sulfur bacteria; Máthé et al. 2014; Andrei et al. 2015; Felföldi et al. 2016; Alexe et al. 2017).;  After phosphate, sulfate is the second most abundant soluble oxyanion inside the bacterial cells (Silver and Walderhaug 1992).;  Contrary to this, in our study, the majority of strains irrespective of their site of isolation grew best in the sulfate-containing media and not in chloride.;  The intensive growth of most tested strains in the presence of sulfate suggest proper adaptation to high concentrations of this anion.;  This could be explained with the abundant occurrence of sulfate in nature as it is the most thermodynamically stable form of sulfur under oxic conditions (Rabus et al. 2013) as well as with the importance of sulfate to microorganisms as the most common source of sulfur (Aguilar-Barajas et al. 2011).;

 As anion the Transylvanian lakes have almost exclusively chloride (> 94 e%; with ~ 4 e% sulfate in the deeper regions of Ursu Lake), while the soda pans of the Kiskunság contain ~ 26–27 e% of chloride and ~ 55–65 e% of carbonates (hydrogen carbonate + carbonate).;  Compared to Kiskunság, the soda pans of Vojvodina have lower concentration of carbonates (~ 30–38 e%) and similar or higher values of chloride (29 and 48 e% in Rusanda and Slano Kopovo, respectively).; In this study a total of 3268 individual salt tolerance measurements have been obtained using 172 bacterial strains grown in 19 different ionic composition and/or salt concentration media (6 carbonate, 6 chloride, 6 sulfate and 1 salt-free nutrient media as control).;  Members of cluster 1 grew well in higher concentrations of the sulfate media, showed slight preference of intermediate concentrations of carbonate and grew relatively poorly in chloride media.;  In contrast, the strains in cluster 2 showed poor growth in carbonate media and intensive growth at higher concentrations of chloride and sulfate media.;  Finally, cluster 3 comprised strains that showed the best growth at medium concentrations of chloride and relatively worse growth in carbonate and sulfate media.; The salt preference determined based on the comparison of the weighted growth values of each strain in the three different salts showed that 59% of the strains grew best in sulfate, 33% in chloride and 8% in carbonate media (Table ​(Table2).2).;  Finally, carbonate preference was over-represented among the strains from Vojvodina (18% compared to 8% for all) and missing among the Transylvanian strains (Table ​(Table2).2).; The mean weighted growth value of the strains also significantly differed among the three salts (Kruskal–Wallis chi-squared = 135.64, df = 2, p value < 0.001) with the growth in carbonate being substantially lower than in chloride and sulfate and the growth in sulfate being slightly but significantly higher than in chloride (Fig. 5, Table S4).;  The growth in the carbonate and chloride media significantly differed also for the strains originating from different regions (Kruskal–Wallis chi-squared = 90.823, df = 2, p value < 0.001, and Kruskal–Wallis chi-squared = 57.529, df = 2, p value < 0.001, respectively).;  The post-hoc analyses by Dunn-test revealed that overall the strains from Kiskunság and Vojvodina grew better in the carbonate media than the strains from Transylvania (Fig. 5, Table S4), while the strains from Transylvania grew better in chloride than those from Vojvodina and Kiskunság, and those from Vojvodina grew also slightly better in chloride than those from Kiskunság (Fig. 5).;  In general, the bacterial strains of Kiskunság and Vojvodina are well-adapted to carbonate, chloride and sulfate, while bacteria isolated from Transylvanian lakes were the least adapted to carbonate, but grew well in the presence of chloride and sulfate.;  Namely, the majority of bacterial strains isolated from lakes dominated by chloride, were adapted to grow in media with higher concentrations of chloride, while strains isolated from aquatic systems containing a considerable amount of carbonate salts were adapted to grow with carbonates.;  Examples of saline systems with non-NaCl dominated ionic composition include soda lakes and ponds (with large amounts of Na-carbonates; Kebede et al. 1994; Boros et al. 2014; Schagerl 2016; Boros and Kolpakova 2018), MgSO4- and CaCl2-brines (Dickson et al. 2013; Fox-Powell and Cockell 2018) and soda lime deposits (mainly with calcium as cation; Kalwasińska et al. 2015, 2019).; Since most natural saline lakes have sodium cation dominance (Hammer 1986; Waiser and Robarts 2009), we focused only on the effect of dissolved anions (namely, chloride, sulfate and carbonates).;  We have to emphasize that as high concentration of dissolved Na-carbonates increases pH, to avoid the potential confounding effect of varying pH, all salt tolerance tests were performed under alkaline conditions (pH ~ 9.0), Still, carbonate had the most substantial effect on the growth, as on average the strains showed significantly poorer growth in these media than in chloride or sulfate indicating widespread maladaptation to carbonate.;  The special effect of carbonate on microbial life has been recognized before and Banciu and Sorokin (2013) even suggested distinguishing microorganisms that prefer Na-carbonates as natronophiles over NaCl-preferring halophiles.;  According to this nomenclature, only 14 strains in this study were truly natronophiles having higher growth in carbonate than in chloride or sulfate media.;  Still, interestingly none of these strains had its highest growth in the highest carbonate concentration media but at intermediate concentrations suggesting that coping with high carbonate concentrations is challenging even for carbonate adapted microorganisms.; The anion-preference and tolerance of the studied strains was related to whether they were isolated from chloride- (Transylvania region: Ursu and Roşu Lake) or carbonate-rich saline lakes (Kiskunság: Zab-szék and Sós-ér; Vojvodina: Rusanda and Slano Kopovo).;  First, all natronophiles were isolated from the carbonate-rich lakes.;  Next, most strikingly the strains isolated from the NaCl-dominated saline lakes that had only negligible proportion (~ 1 e%) of carbonates, grew very poorly on carbonate further corroborating the idea that coping with carbonates requires special physiological adaptation.;  The strains isolated from the Transylvanian lakes had significantly better growth in chloride than the strains isolated from the carbonate-rich lakes and the NaCl-preferring halophilic strains were also over-represented among them.;  For example, strains from the two soda lake regions showed growth at diverse concentrations of all three tested salts, while the strains from Transylvania, although they grew mostly poorly in carbonate media, had a wide optimum range for chloride and sulfate.;  Accordingly, we found that adaptation to carbonate was more common for Bacilli strains than for other taxa, while carbonate maladaptation was more often detected among proteobacterial and especially Gammaproteobacteria strains.;  For example, the 9 strains of Bacillus alkalisediminis isolated from Zab-szék in Kiskunság clustered into the three different clusters on the heatmap and among them all three salt preferences types could be identified (i.e., carbonate, chloride and sulfate).; Our study demonstrated that the analysis of the effect of low to medium salinity stress exerted by different sodium salts (carbonate, chloride, and sulfate) can reveal rich, origin-dependent diversity in bacterial adaptation that studies testing salt tolerance and adaptation only to sodium chloride at high concentrations mostly overlook.;  More precisely, we concluded that in general sodium carbonate salts pose a selective force that impact bacteria more substantially than the other tested salts and to which only few, so called natronophilic microorganisms are adapted."
"Sodium carbonate","C005686",35137260,8825391," Sodium carbonate represented the strongest selective force, while majority of strains was well-adapted to growth even at high concentrations of sodium sulfate."
"sodium sulfate","C012036",35137260,8825391," Sodium carbonate represented the strongest selective force, while majority of strains was well-adapted to growth even at high concentrations of sodium sulfate.;  To achieve this, growth tests were performed using media with different salt concentration values and ionic compositions on bacterial strains that were isolated from three sets of saline lakes that differed in ionic composition (Fig. 1): (1) two soda lakes located in Kiskunság (Hungary, Central Europe), characterized by high sodium hydrogen carbonate content (Boros et al. 2014); (2) two soda lakes in Vojvodina (Serbia, Central/Southeast Europe) with approximately equal proportion of sodium hydrogen carbonate, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate (Boros et al. 2014); and (3) two Transylvanian saline lakes (Romania, Eastern Europe), which are dominated by sodium chloride (Borsodi et al. 2013; Máthé et al. 2014; Andrei et al. 2015; Felföldi et al. 2016).; The salt tolerance tests were performed using nutrient-based (DSMZ medium 1, www.dsmz.de) media containing sodium chloride, sodium hydrogen carbonate and sodium carbonate or sodium sulfate at different concentration (Table ​(Table1);1); which throughout this study are referred to as ‘chloride’, ‘carbonate’ and ‘sulfate’ media, respectively.;  The only exception was the highest salt concentration treatment used for sulfate, which due to the high molar weight of sodium sulfate corresponded to the hypersaline category.;  The tested salinity levels correspond mostly to hypo- and mesosaline conditions with the only exception of the highest sodium sulfate media that corresponded to hypersaline conditions."
"salts","D012492",35137260,8825391," Our results suggest that the extent of the effect of dissolved salts in saline lakes is not limited to their concentration but the type of anion also substantially impacts the growth and survival of individual microorganisms.;  Endorheic lakes are filled with precipitation water, groundwater and runoff from the surrounding land but due to the lack of outflow, water loss happens only through evaporation, which leaves behind the dissolved salts (Wetzel 2001; Tundisi and Tundisi 2012).;  Saline waters can be characterized by the amount of eight major ions dissolved in the water: Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3−, CO32−, Cl− and SO42−. Similarly to the salt concentration, chemical composition of the salts is also primarily determined by the mineral composition of the drainage basin.;  Furthermore, due to the evaporation induced concentration increases, certain types of salts may precipitate, while others remain in solution further modifying the ionic composition.;  The first salt to precipitate is typically lime (CaCO3), followed by dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2], then gypsum (CaSO4 × H2O), and finally other salts (Waiser and Robarts 2009; Schagerl 2016).; The concentration of different salts also affects other physicochemical properties of the lake water, e.g., with increasing salt concentration, the oxygen solubility and the freezing point of the water decreases, while density increases; and dissolved salts can also modulate the amount of available nutrients (Williams and Sherwood 1994; Shadrin 2018).;  Dissolved salts are shown in molar ratio.;  In summary, the tests were performed using nutrient broth containing one of the three tested salts and each type of media consisted of a series of eight different salt concentration values.; Mass and molar concentration of salts in the liquid nutrient media used for the salt tolerance tests; The salt preference determined based on the comparison of the weighted growth values of each strain in the three different salts showed that 59% of the strains grew best in sulfate, 33% in chloride and 8% in carbonate media (Table ​(Table2).2).; The mean weighted growth value of the strains also significantly differed among the three salts (Kruskal–Wallis chi-squared = 135.64, df = 2, p value < 0.001) with the growth in carbonate being substantially lower than in chloride and sulfate and the growth in sulfate being slightly but significantly higher than in chloride (Fig. 5, Table S4).;  Namely, the majority of bacterial strains isolated from lakes dominated by chloride, were adapted to grow in media with higher concentrations of chloride, while strains isolated from aquatic systems containing a considerable amount of carbonate salts were adapted to grow with carbonates.;  More precisely, in moderately saline aquatic habitats and in environments with fluctuating salinity such as those typical for shallow soda pans, microbes are more likely to cope with osmotic stress by applying the energetically more expensive but flexible ‘salt-out’ (’compatible solute’) strategy (i.e., exclusion of salt ions from the cytoplasm with simultaneous accumulation of low molecular weight organic compounds to lower the intracellular water activity and stabilize the hydration shell of proteins) rather than the ‘salt-in’ strategy (accumulation of inorganic salts intracellularly) (Oren 2013a; Gunde-Cimerman et al. 2018; Menéndez-Serra et al. 2021).;  Despite this huge diversity of ionic composition in saline aquatic habitats, most salt adaptation studies focus only on the biological effect of different concentration values of NaCl, making studies like ours, where salt tolerance is explored for salts others than NaCl crucial for the understanding of the selective forces that saline habitats exert on aquatic microbes.; Although organisms living in saline environments with different dominant ions are expected to have different strategies to cope with the unfavorable effects of dissolved ions (Hallsworth et al. 2007; Banciu and Muntyan 2015; Sorokin et al. 2015), the influence of different salts on bacteria has been scarcely studied previously.;  For example, Stevens and Cockell (2020) determined for a single Bacillus subtilis strain in eight different salts the highest molar concentration, where growth could be still detected.;  Waajen et al. (2020) also indicated that anion properties were among the most important parameters that affected the survival of a Planococcus halocryophilus strain at extremely low temperature values when comparing brine solutions of nine different salts, while Banciu et al. (2004) observed higher biomass yield of a Thialkalivibrio halophilus strain in NaCl than in Na2CO3, and hypothesized that the adaptation to high salinities could, at least partly, be explained with differences in the osmotic pressure caused by these salts at equal sodium ion concentration (4 M).;  Contrary to these experiments performed on individual bacterial strains, to the best of our knowledge, systematic study on the effect of different dissolved ions on a large set of bacteria isolated from different saline lakes like ours (i.e., 172 bacterial strains isolated from 6 different lakes in 3 different regions and tested on 3 different salts) has not been carried out before.;  For example, strains from the two soda lake regions showed growth at diverse concentrations of all three tested salts, while the strains from Transylvania, although they grew mostly poorly in carbonate media, had a wide optimum range for chloride and sulfate.; Our study demonstrated that the analysis of the effect of low to medium salinity stress exerted by different sodium salts (carbonate, chloride, and sulfate) can reveal rich, origin-dependent diversity in bacterial adaptation that studies testing salt tolerance and adaptation only to sodium chloride at high concentrations mostly overlook.;  More precisely, we concluded that in general sodium carbonate salts pose a selective force that impact bacteria more substantially than the other tested salts and to which only few, so called natronophilic microorganisms are adapted.;  Furthermore, we found that while sulfate tolerance was widespread among strains isolated from different saline sources, in general, growth intensity in media with different concentrations of different salts was related to the origin and to some extent the taxonomy of the strains."

"water","D014867",36000901,9602452,"Balneotherapeutic water springs, such as those with thermal, saline, sulfur, or any other characteristics, have recently been the subject of phylogenetic studies with a closer focus on the description and/or isolation of phylogenetically novel or biotechnologically interesting microorganisms.;  In this culture-dependent study of radioactive water springs of Jáchymov (Joachimstahl), Czech Republic, we investigated a combination of classical cultivation approaches with those imitating sampling source conditions.;  Due to their origin from radioactive waters, we determined the resistance of the isolates to oxidative stress.;  In summary, our culturomic analysis shows that subsurface water springs contain diverse bacterial populations, including as-yet-undescribed taxa and strains with promising biotechnological potential.; IMPORTANCE The mine Svornost in Jáchymov (Joachimstahl), Czech Republic is a former silver-uranium mine and the world’s first and for a long time only radium mine, nowadays the deepest mine devoted to the extraction of water which is saturated with radon and has therapeutic benefits given its chemical properties.;  This healing water, which is approximately 13 thousand years old, is used under medical supervision for the treatment of patients with neurological and rheumatic disorders.;  Our culturomic approach using low concentrations of growth substrates or the environmental matrix itself (i.e., water filtrate) in culturing media combined with prolonged cultivation time resulted in the isolation of a broad spectrum of microorganisms from 4 radioactive springs of Jáchymov which are phylogenetically novel and/or bear various adaptive or coping mechanisms to thrive under selective pressure and can thus provide a wide spectrum of capabilities potentially exploitable in diverse scientific, biotechnological, or medical disciplines.; Geothermally heated groundwater, such as thermal springs with temperatures higher than 37°C or less warm thermal springs reaching the surface with a temperature of at least 20°C, are natural phenomena that occur worldwide (1, 2).;  Since the final character of water springs can be influenced not just by the chemical composition, pH, temperature, and salinity (3, 4), but also by tectonic settings and subsurface bedrock (1), every single water spring can be considered to be a unique habitat.; A promising location both in terms of potentially taxonomically and/or biotechnologically novel microorganisms is the mine Svornost in Jáchymov (Joachimstahl), Czech Republic, a former silver-uranium mine and the world’s first and for a long time only radium mine, nowadays the deepest mine devoted to the extraction of water which is saturated with radon (222Rn ~ 24 kBq/l) (29) due to radium decay in Jáchymov subsoil, and has therapeutic benefits given its chemical properties.;  This healing water, which is approximately 13 thousand years old, is used under medical supervision for the treatment of patients with neurological and rheumatic disorders.;  The first radioactive water spring to be used was named Curie, followed by the springs called Agricola, C1, and Academician Běhounek.;  This geologically ancient site with very rare characteristics of its waters can be described as an inhospitable place for any form of life.;  Furthermore, due to their radioactive character, the waters were expected to host radiotolerant or radioresistant microorganisms.; With the above in mind, we applied a series of environmentally relevant cultivation methods leading to the isolation of a diverse spectrum of prokaryotic microorganisms from Jáchymov's radioactive water springs.;  Moreover, in order to imitate the conditions of water springs, we used sterilized spring water as the liquid part of all media, or even as the medium itself.; The media adjustments used here, such as the dilution of commercial media, use of water filtrate from the original source in media, low concentration of heterotrophic substrates, etc. (Table 1), resulted in the isolation of 1,095 pure cultures spanning 9 phylogenetic classes of 5 phyla (Fig. 1).;  None of the isolates were isolated simultaneously from all 4 water springs, and only members of the genus Bacillus were isolated from all 4 springs.; (a) Relative abundance of dereplicated isolates (at the level of genus and class) in 4 radioactive water springs. (b) Phylogenetic tree showing evolutionary relationship of isolates.;  The only isolate which was novel at the genus level was isolated from radioactive water spring C1 (radioactivity 11 kBq/l) on the FRR medium, and was designated J379.; In order to confirm the hypothesis that microorganisms living in the radioactive water springs of the Svornost mine are able to sustain oxidative stress, we conducted a functional assay of the oxidative stress response of the isolated cultures to menadione (80 μM) and hydrogen peroxide (9.8 M).; Response to induced oxidative stress as zone of clearance upon exposure of strains to hydrogen peroxide and menadione (a) and presence of genes (shown as a gene copy per genome) involved in endogenous defense mechanism (EDM), including antioxidant defense genes (b) and completeness of diverse carotenoid biosynthesis pathway (c) in genomes of phylogenetically novel taxa from Jáchymov’s radon water springs.; Radionuclides in subsurface waters are a common phenomenon on Earth.;  The majority of radioactive elements in water come from uranium, thorium, and actinium series, with the most abundant elements being 238U, 236Ra, and 232Th (38).;  Radon, produced by the radioactive decay of uranium and radium, is a very frequent radioactive gas contained in water springs (39,–41), an example being Jáchymov's water springs.;  Among these exceptional sites are the Stripa granite groundwaters (Sweden), with an 222Rn concentration of ~100 kBq/l (40, 47), and also the highly radioactive water springs of Jáchymov studied here, with the concentration of 222Rn reaching up to 24 kBq/l (29).; In general, due to their deep location and inaccessible terrain, underground water springs are rarely explored, and so their microbial colonization remains hidden.;  So far, only a small number of radioactive water springs have been subjected to microbial screening (48,–50), and extremely little is known about the composition of the microbial communities of underground radioactive springs.;  The 16S rRNA gene-based and metagenomic analyses also proved the presence of several members of Archaea in many water springs (51,–54).;  In this report, a culturomic survey was conducted of four springs from the world’s oldest radium mine devoted to the extraction of radon-saturated water by applying ‘elemental’ culture procedures using media containing substrates relevant to oligotrophic environments (Fig. 1).;  These results clearly support the hypothesis that extreme environments, such as the radon waters analyzed here, host phylogenetically novel microorganisms (Fig. 2b and Table 2).;  Moreover, the assumption that radon water populations are able to resist oxidative stress was confirmed (Fig. 3); some 30% of the tested isolates, in particular those from the Micrococcaceae, Deinococcaceae, Bacillaceae, and Moraxellaceae families, exhibited lower sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide than D. radiodurans DSM 20539T, which was reported to be highly resistant to oxidative stress (60).;  Some isolates in our study belonged to families usually found in soils or rhizosphere, such as Bradyrhizobiaceae and Rhizobiaceae (Fig. 2a), yet their isolation from subsurface waters is in accordance with the study of Pedron, 2019 (67), who isolated populations of these families from Italian thermal springs.;  In fact, members of Bradyrhizobiaceae and Rhizobiaceae as well as other bacteria living in aquifers can naturally occur in sediments or on rock surfaces attached to mineral particles (67), and thus their presence in spring water samples can be expected.;  In line with the hypothesis that Jáchymov's very deep and ancient radon waters are extremely nutrient-poor matrices where microorganisms utilize inorganic substrates from the surrounding rock and water or utilize scarce organic matter that has infiltrated into the underground through groundwater, we used plain spring water as the main component of the cultivation media.;  Since we obtained more than 130 isolates using this non-supplemented groundwater-based medium (Fig. 1), we suppose that this imitation of the environment contributes to increased cultivation yields similarly to Wu, 2020 (70).;  In terms of the isolation of previously unidentified taxa, the spring-water-amended 1/10 R2A and lactate medium turned out to be the most suitable for such cultivation, yet members of novel species were also isolated on FRR and Thiobacillus agar (Table 2).;  The closest relatives of some of the newly described taxa were previously isolated from aquatic environments, such as Rhizobacter profundi DS48-6-5T (74), isolated from freshwater sediment in Korea; Aquabacterium pictum W35T (75), isolated from Tama River in Japan; Aquincola tetriaricarbonis L10T (76), isolated from contaminated groundwater (Germany); or Flavobacterium album HYN0059T (77), isolated from a freshwater lake (Korea).;  Our study thus contributes to a growing body of studies that report radioactive sites and water springs as sites with as-yet uncultured or unidentified microorganisms, often with desired capabilities, such as UV-radiation resistant Deinococcus sahariensis isolated from water springs in the Tunisian Sahara (84), or γ radiation-tolerant Sphingomonas jaspsi isolated from fresh water in the Misasa region in Japan, which is known for its high natural radioactivity (85).; The high radon level in Jáchymov's water springs very likely represents conditions that have forced the indigenous microorganisms to undergo some of the above specific adaptations.; In summary, our culturomic approach using low concentrations of growth substrates or the environmental matrix itself (i.e., water filtrate) in culturing media combined with prolonged cultivation time resulted in the isolation of a broad spectrum of microorganisms.; The 4 radioactive water springs Agricola (water resource yield 10 l/min., temperature 29°C, radioactivity 20 kBq/l), Běhounek (300 l/min., 36°C, 10 kBq/l), C1 (30 l/min., 29°C, 11 kBq/l), and Curie (30 l/min., 29°C, 5 kBq/l) spring up at a depth of 500 m below the surface of gneiss mountain bedrock, in the former silver-uranium mine Svornost (Jáchymov, Czech Republic; GPS 50°22′22.9″N 12°54′42.1″E).;  The chemical composition of the water springs is summarized in Table S1.;  Under sterile conditions, 20 liters of each spring water was collected and separately filtered with low vacuum through Merck Millipore Sterito Sterile Vacuum Bottle-Top Filters with PES filter membranes with a 0.2 μm pore size (Fisher Scientific).;  Filtered water (filtrate) was preserved for further experiments overnight at 28°C or 37°C (according to the spring’s temperature).;  Filter membranes with retained cells were excised from the plastic cup using a sterile pair of tweezers, placed into 25 mL of sterile filtrate of the respective spring water, and incubated for 48 h at 120 rpm.; Six nutrient-poor media imitating the original conditions of the water springs and 2 nutrient-rich media were used in this study (Table 1).;  The sixth nutrient-poor medium, a Thiobacillus agar (DSMZ, no. 36m), and 2 nutrient-rich media, 10x diluted Reasoners' 2A medium (1/10 R2A; Merck) and FRR 6, FRR 8 agar (DSMZ no. 822, herein referred to as FRR), were prepared according to the manufacturers' instructions, except that the distilled water was replaced with the filtrate.;  Inoculated and sealed plates were incubated at 28°C or 37°C, according to the respective water spring’s temperature, for 6 to 14 weeks until the appearance of colonies.; Genomic DNA of dereplicated isolates was isolated by thermal lysis (by resuspending an entire microbiological loop of biomass in water for molecular biology and heating it at 98°C for 20 min) or, for hardly lysable cultures, with the aid of a PureLink Genomic DNA Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.;  The nearly complete 16S rRNA gene was amplified with 8-27F primer (5′-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3'') (115) and 1509 −1492R primer (5′-GYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′) (115) in 15 μL reactions containing: 7.5 μL KAPA HiFi HotStart Mix 2x (KapaBiosystems, Roche; 0.02U/μL; mixture already contains Mg2+ and dNTPs); 0.3 μM primers (Sigma-Aldrich, UK); 1 μL of DNA template (5-20 ng/μL); and 6,41 μL of water for molecular biology (Sigma-Aldrich, UK)."

"menadione","D024483",36000901,9602452," Most of the isolates were more resistant to menadione than the model strain Deinococcus radiodurans DSM 20539T.;  Based on this presumption, we built up a functional analysis of isolated cultures where chemical compounds menadione (34,–36) and hydrogen peroxide (34, 36, 37) were used as intracellular ROS inducers.; In order to confirm the hypothesis that microorganisms living in the radioactive water springs of the Svornost mine are able to sustain oxidative stress, we conducted a functional assay of the oxidative stress response of the isolated cultures to menadione (80 μM) and hydrogen peroxide (9.8 M).;  The growth inhibition zones of the reference strain D. radiodurans DSM 20539T were very similar for menadione and hydrogen peroxide, 18 and 17 mm, respectively.;  The majority of the isolates were more resistant to menadione than D. radiodurans DSM 20539T, with the most resistant isolates having an inhibition zone radius of 0–5 mm.;  In addition, hydrogen peroxide appeared to be a stronger growth inhibitor than menadione (Fig. 3), with the most resistant isolates being those of the genera Bacillus, Bosea, Microbacterium, and Pseudomonas.; Response of bacterial isolates to menadione (a) and hydrogen peroxide (b).; Seven out of the 12 phylogenetically novel isolates were more resistant to menadione than D. radiodurans DSM 20539T, with those affiliated to the genera Pseudomonas (J452) and Phenylobacterium (J367 and J426) exhibiting the highest resistance to menadione (Fig. 4a).;  J276 with abundant stress response genes also had the highest tolerance to hydrogen peroxide and menadione (Fig. 4 a and ​andb,b, and Fig.; Response to induced oxidative stress as zone of clearance upon exposure of strains to hydrogen peroxide and menadione (a) and presence of genes (shown as a gene copy per genome) involved in endogenous defense mechanism (EDM), including antioxidant defense genes (b) and completeness of diverse carotenoid biosynthesis pathway (c) in genomes of phylogenetically novel taxa from Jáchymov’s radon water springs.;  The presence of genes that were positively correlated with tolerance to both hydrogen peroxide and menadione included: mutL, mutS (DNA mismatch repair protein) (P ≤ 0.05 and P ≤ 0.001, respectively), and glutathione peroxidase (P ≤ 0.01 and P ≤ 0.001, respectively).;  Similarly, the genes for catalase-peroxidase (P ≤ 0.05), the superoxide dismutase-Cu-Zn family (P ≤ 0.001), DNA polymerase IV (P ≤ 0.001), radA (DNA recombination and repair protein) (P ≤ 0.001), 5-oxoprolinase (P ≤ 0.001), glutamate-cysteine ligase (P ≤ 0.001), and glutathione synthetase (P ≤ 0.001) were positively correlated with tolerance to menadione, whereas crtL (Lycopene β-cyclase) (P ≤ 0.01), Mn-containing catalase (P ≤ 0.05), DNA polymerase I (P ≤ 0.001), endonuclease III (P ≤ 0.001), and formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (P ≤ 0.001) were correlated negatively.; Spearman's rank correlation analysis representing relationship between response to induced oxidative stress (menadione and hydrogen peroxide) and the presence of endogenous defense genes.;  In addition, the vast majority of the isolates were more resistant to menadione (80 mM) than D. radiodurans DSM 20539T (Fig. 3).;  Even the isolate of the genus Deinococcus (strain J250) was more resistant to both hydrogen peroxide and menadione (Fig. 3).;  Radio-resistant microorganisms are often co-resistant, or at least less sensitive, to other types of DNA- or protein damage caused by UV-irradiation, desiccation, exposure to toxic metals, high temperatures (50), or by certain chemical compounds such as menadione or hydrogen peroxide that were also used here as oxidative stress inducers.;  Many of our isolates proved to be more tolerant to menadione than the reference strain D. radiodurans DSM 20539T, and some were more resistant to hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 3).;  One of the genes positively correlated with the response to hydrogen peroxide and menadione was glutathione peroxidase (P ≤ 0.01 and P ≤ 0.001, respectively) (Fig. 5).;  Similarly, antioxidant genes such as those encoding catalase-peroxidase (P ≤ 0.05) and the superoxide dismutase-Cu-Zn family (P ≤ 0.001) were also positively correlated with tolerance of menadione.;  Additionally, a positive correlation between hydrogen peroxide or menadione tolerance and the presence of genes encoding MutL, MutS (DNA mismatch repair protein) (P ≤ 0.05 and P ≤ 0.001, respectively) emphasize the role of DNA repair in the adaption to this stress (95).;  The DNA recombination and repair protein RadA (P ≤ 0.001) was also positively correlated wiht the response to menadione.;  The positive correlation of the presence of genes responsible for glutathione synthesis, such as glutamate-cysteine ligase (P ≤ 0.001) and glutathione synthetase (P ≤ 0.001), with menadione tolerance emphasizes the glutathione-mediated scavenging of ROS (93, 94).;

"hydrogen peroxide","D006861",36000901,9602452," Moreover, isolates of the Deinococcacecae, Micrococcaceae, Bacillaceae, Moraxellaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae families even exhibited higher resistance in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.;  Based on this presumption, we built up a functional analysis of isolated cultures where chemical compounds menadione (34,–36) and hydrogen peroxide (34, 36, 37) were used as intracellular ROS inducers.; In order to confirm the hypothesis that microorganisms living in the radioactive water springs of the Svornost mine are able to sustain oxidative stress, we conducted a functional assay of the oxidative stress response of the isolated cultures to menadione (80 μM) and hydrogen peroxide (9.8 M).;  The growth inhibition zones of the reference strain D. radiodurans DSM 20539T were very similar for menadione and hydrogen peroxide, 18 and 17 mm, respectively.;  In addition, hydrogen peroxide appeared to be a stronger growth inhibitor than menadione (Fig. 3), with the most resistant isolates being those of the genera Bacillus, Bosea, Microbacterium, and Pseudomonas.; Response of bacterial isolates to menadione (a) and hydrogen peroxide (b).;  J276 with abundant stress response genes also had the highest tolerance to hydrogen peroxide and menadione (Fig. 4 a and ​andb,b, and Fig.;

 The presence of genes that were positively correlated with tolerance to both hydrogen peroxide and menadione included: mutL, mutS (DNA mismatch repair protein) (P ≤ 0.05 and P ≤ 0.001, respectively), and glutathione peroxidase (P ≤ 0.01 and P ≤ 0.001, respectively).;  The presence of the recF gene (DNA recombination and repair protein) (P ≤ 0.05) was positively correlated with tolerance to hydrogen peroxide, whereas catalase-peroxidase (P ≤ 0.05), γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (P ≤ 0.05) and glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (P ≤ 0.01) were correlated negatively.; Spearman's rank correlation analysis representing relationship between response to induced oxidative stress (menadione and hydrogen peroxide) and the presence of endogenous defense genes.;  Moreover, the assumption that radon water populations are able to resist oxidative stress was confirmed (Fig. 3); some 30% of the tested isolates, in particular those from the Micrococcaceae, Deinococcaceae, Bacillaceae, and Moraxellaceae families, exhibited lower sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide than D. radiodurans DSM 20539T, which was reported to be highly resistant to oxidative stress (60).;  Even the isolate of the genus Deinococcus (strain J250) was more resistant to both hydrogen peroxide and menadione (Fig. 3).;  Radio-resistant microorganisms are often co-resistant, or at least less sensitive, to other types of DNA- or protein damage caused by UV-irradiation, desiccation, exposure to toxic metals, high temperatures (50), or by certain chemical compounds such as menadione or hydrogen peroxide that were also used here as oxidative stress inducers.;  Many of our isolates proved to be more tolerant to menadione than the reference strain D. radiodurans DSM 20539T, and some were more resistant to hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 3).;  One of the genes positively correlated with the response to hydrogen peroxide and menadione was glutathione peroxidase (P ≤ 0.01 and P ≤ 0.001, respectively) (Fig. 5).;  Additionally, a positive correlation between hydrogen peroxide or menadione tolerance and the presence of genes encoding MutL, MutS (DNA mismatch repair protein) (P ≤ 0.05 and P ≤ 0.001, respectively) emphasize the role of DNA repair in the adaption to this stress (95).;  In fact, our isolates with missing radA genes were less tolerant to hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 4a and Fig.;  Menadione 80 mM (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone; Merck) and hydrogen peroxide 9.8 M (30%wt/wt; Merck) were used as oxidative stress-inducing agents.;  The type strain D. radiodurans DSM 20539T, which exhibits a strong resistance to oxidative stress, including that induced by hydrogen peroxide (60), was used as a reference strain to determine the resistance/sensitivity of the isolates to oxidative stress.; The genomes of identified phylogenetically novel taxa were screened for the presence of genes involved in protecting against oxidative damage by various ROS, such as those encoding for catalases, metal-catalases, alkyl hydroperoxide reductases, and organic hydroperoxides as well as carotenoid biosynthesis enzymes, DNA repair enzymes, glutathione, and other regulatory genes, including those encoding the redox-sensitive transcriptional activator SoxR and hydrogen peroxide-inducible genes activator OxyR.;

"saline","D012965",34256694,8278772,"Our results indicate that AQPs play an important role in C. rosea responses to saline-alkaline soils and drought stress.;  Canavalia rosea belongs to the “mangrove associates” group, in which some elaborate mechanisms for adapting to highly saline and alkaline soils and drought stress have evolved at both the morphological and physiological-molecular levels.;  Saline-alkaline soils and drought stress both cause plant cellular water deficits [3] and result in water imbalances, from root water uptake to leaf transpiration [4]. Identification of genes involved in responding to water-deficit stress in C. rosea may be valuable for molecular breeding improvement of saline-alkaline and drought-related traits through genetic engineering.;  This is largely because AQP genes are seen as candidates for use in genetic modification of crops to increase agricultural productivity [39, 40]. The saltbush Atriplex canescens is highly tolerant of saline-alkaline soils, drought, heavy metals, and cold, and the AQP genes AcPIP2 and AcNIP5;1 have been shown to be involved in abiotic stress tolerance in this species, and their overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis caused altered tolerance to drought and salt [41, 42]. Compared with cultivated soybean, the wild Glycine soja is relatively salt-alkaline tolerant.; Canavalia rosea is a salt- and alkaline-tolerant and drought-adapted halophyte, and abiotic stressors, such as saline-alkaline soil, seasonal drought, strong solar irradiance, and high temperatures, are the main limiting factors that induce osmotic stress and disturb water balance for this species and other tropical seaside plants.;  The results showed that CrPIP expression was most affected under the saline-alkaline, high osmotic stress, and ABA treatments.;  These data are especially helpful for characterizing AQP-interacting protein complexes involved in C. rosea’s adaptations to harsh environmental conditions such as low water availability and saline-alkaline soils.;  We assessed the overexpression of CrPIP1;5 in transgenic Arabidopsis, and CrPIP1;5 lead to slightly reduced saline-alkaline and drought tolerance, which showed the exact opposite phenotype compared with CrPIP2;3’s overexpression in Arabidopsis [36]. This also suggests that CrPIP1;5 could play a key role in water transport.; The leguminous nitrogen-fixing plant, C. rosea, presents extreme saline-alkaline and drought resistance and is used as pioneer species on islands and reefs for artificial vegetation construction.;  Although our results showed that overexpression of CrPIP1;5 could increase sensitivity to saline-alkaline and drought conditions in yeast and plants, combining the high and regulatable expression of CrPIP1;5 in C. rosea, it can be inferred that CrPIP1;5 is one of basic and important functional genes for facilitating water transportation in vivo, and might be involved in the C. rosea ecological adaptation to tropical coral reef."
"water","D014867",34256694,8278772," Seawater and drought tolerance in this species may be facilitated by aquaporins (AQPs), channel proteins that transport water and small molecules across cell membranes and thereby maintain cellular water homeostasis in the face of abiotic stress.; Canavalia rosea (Sw.) DC. (also called bay bean) is an extremophile halophyte and nitrogen-fixing legume species that is widely distributed in coastal areas of tropical and subtropical regions and is highly adapted to seawater and drought conditions [1]. The seeds of C. rosea have nutritional and medicinal value and this species constitutes an important wild plant resource.;  Saline-alkaline soils and drought stress both cause plant cellular water deficits [3] and result in water imbalances, from root water uptake to leaf transpiration [4]. Identification of genes involved in responding to water-deficit stress in C. rosea may be valuable for molecular breeding improvement of saline-alkaline and drought-related traits through genetic engineering.; Water is an essential component of any biological system and plants exhibit elaborate adaptations to maintain survival in the presence of water stress.;  Aquaporins (AQPs) are transmembrane proteins that play critical roles in controlling transmembrane water transport in and out of plant cells by forming water channels [5]. In addition to water transport, AQPs facilitate the transport of small molecules such as urea, H2O2, and NO, and elements such as boron and silicon across cell membranes [6]. Aquaporins are found in a wide variety of taxa, including microbes, animals, and plants, and are the oldest family of major intrinsic proteins (MIPs).;  These conserved, hydrophobic loops seem to be the most important features maintaining AQP function by forming short helices [12, 13]. Aromatic/Arginine regions (ar/R) and Froger’s positions are also conserved in most of AQPs [14]. Generally, AQPs are inserted into membranes in a tetrameric structure comprising four independent pores created by AQP monomers [15]. Besides being water channel proteins, some AQPs are also involved in facilitating the transport of CO2 [16], NO [17], glycerol [18], H2O2 [19], some trivalent elements [20], and a wide range of small uncharged solutes [21]. It is clear that AQPs show versatile functions in water uptake, nutrient balancing, long-distance signal transfer, nutrient/heavy metal acquisition in plant development, and stress responses [22].;  The AQP family in E. salsugineum has been characterized by assessing differential gene expression patterns, with research mostly focused on assessing responses to salt, cold, and drought stress [29, 30]. Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) has better drought tolerance than most of leguminous species and its AQP gene family has been characterized to further investigate its adaptability to water deficit [31, 32]. Furthermore the AQP gene family of cassava (Manihot esculenta), a drought-tolerant tuber that is an important food resource in many African countries, has been characterized in terms of its evolution, structure, and expression patterns [33]. Canavalia rosea is more tolerant to drought, high salinity, heat, and low nitrogen and phosphorous than most of leguminous plants.; The phosphorylation state of AQP proteins is a key factor regulating the transport of water and other small molecules, or affecting of the protein subcellular localization [14, 22]. In this study, we predicted the possible phosphorylation sites of CrAQPs.;  The subcellular localizations of CrAQPs showed diverse and broad patterns, indicating that the in vivo compartmentation of CrAQPs is highly variable for each member to regulate transport of water and/or solutes across the plasma membrane and intracellular membrane systems, thereby exercising unique biological functions.;  In addition, because PIPs play an important roles in maintaining water balance in plant cells, we summarized the abiotic stress-related cis-acting elements (including ABRE, ERE, MYB, MBS, TC-rich repeats, and MYC) within 11 CrPIP promoter regions (Fig. 4b).;  Combining these results with the RNA-Seq data (Fig. 5), it is evident that these genes maintained higher expression levels than the other CrAQP genes across different tissues and habitats, suggesting that they may be involved in maintaining basic and primary water homeostasis during C. rosea growth and development.; A previous study indicated that plant PIP1 and PIP2 members can associate together in heterodimers and tetramers [35]. In our previous study, we have functional identified a C. rosea PIP2 gene, CrPIP2;3, being involved in drought tolerance in transgenic plant [36]. CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 were both initially isolated from C. rosea cDNA library, and these two members showed much higher expression level in different tissues of C. rosea than other CrAQPs (Fig. 5a), which might indicate their relative importance of maintaining water balance in vivo.;  Together, these results indicate that, at least in yeast cells, these two CrPIP members can interact with themselves and each other to form active pores for water and small molecule transport across membranes.; The seeds of WT and CrPIP1;5 OX lines were grown in well-watered conditions for 30 days, and prior to the salt, drought, and alkaline stress treatments, the growth rates of adult plants (WT and three CrPIP1;5 OX lines) were relatively consistent.;  After 10 days of water withdrawal, all plants wilted to some degree in both WT and the three CrPIP1;5 OX lines.;  After re-watering and growing for another 7 days, most of the CrPIP1;5 OX plants did not recover, while most of the WT plants did recover and had a higher survival rate than CrPIP1;5 OX plants (Fig. 9b).;  Within the plasma membrane, CrPIP1;5 was folded into a specific transmembrane channel and functioned as a water transporter.;  Aquaporins are a class of integral membrane proteins that facilitate the diffusion of water and other small solutes.;  Aquaporins have been reported to play crucial roles in plant water balance and homeostasis under adverse growing conditions [5, 21] and in response to specific biotic challenges [37, 38]. In this study, we performed genome-wide identification and characterization of AQPs in C. rosea to understand the evolution of this family and its molecular roles.;  Two AQP genes from G. soja, GsTIP2;1 and GsPIP2;1, minimized tolerance to salt and dehydration stress when overexpressed in Arabidopsis, implying they have negative impacts on stress tolerance by regulating water potential [43, 44]. In most functional analyses conducted in transgenic plants, the overexpression of AQP genes caused elevated tolerance to salt and drought, such as in Malus zumi (gene MzPIP2;1) [45], Sesuvium portulacastrum (SpAQP1) [46], Stipa purpurea (SpPIP1) [47], Simmondsia chinensis (ScPIP1) [48], Thellungiella salsuginea (TsPIP1;1) [49], and Phoenix dactylifera (PdPIP1;2) [50]. The elevated expression of AQP genes in plants can lead to cellular changes in water potential, which cause alterations in water uptake and transpiration, and ultimately modify tolerance to water deficit stress.;  In this respect, understanding the distribution, expansion, regulation, phylogenetic diversity, and evolutionary selection of AQP genes in extremophile plants like C. rosea is an important step toward potentially improving the water utilization abilities and drought adaptations of other plant species, including agricultural crops.; Plant AQPs play versatile physiological roles in combatting abiotic stress, not only by regulating water content and potential, but also by transporting certain signaling molecules and nutrients.;  We also analyzed Froger’s positions (P1–P5), five conserved amino acid residues that are related to glycerol transport in water-conducting AQPs.;  It is supposed that plant TIPs may transport various small solutes, including H2O2, NH4+, and urea, in addition to water [40]. As with other plant TIPs, CrTIPs are mainly located in vacuolar membranes and may be involved in the regulation of water flow across subcellular compartments of organelles [52]. The variation of CrTIPs in ar/R selectivity filter sequences may contribute to their multiple transport functions, and their NPA spacing varies from 79 to 127 amino acid residues, which indicates that CrTIPs might also be involved in the transmembrane transport of multiple small molecules.; Canavalia rosea is a salt- and alkaline-tolerant and drought-adapted halophyte, and abiotic stressors, such as saline-alkaline soil, seasonal drought, strong solar irradiance, and high temperatures, are the main limiting factors that induce osmotic stress and disturb water balance for this species and other tropical seaside plants.;  For regulating the water transport under different abiotic stresses efficiently, plant often changes the expression of aquaporin genes through a series of complex steps to control the water uptake or management.;  However, the water management effectiveness and patterns could always depending on the plant growth conditions or tissue type, as well as the different types or degrees of water stress and the specificity of AQP members [54]. In plant, the PIP isoforms were supposed to playing major roles in maintaining plant water homeostasis and responses to abiotic stress [11, 55]. Gene transcript levels are dependent upon the structures of their promoters.;  Similar results were also observed in leguminous plant, chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) [32]. In the drought-tolerant genotype chickpea, two subfamilies (CaPIPs and CaTIPs) showed high expression in all tissues as compared to other subfamilies, which indicated these two subfamilies were essential for water transportation and carried drought tolerant.;  The qRT-PCR results also showed some of PIP members showed much higher expression level in drought-tolerant genotype chickpea than in drought-tolerant genotype chickpea [32]. Our results suggest that differential expression of CrPIPs might be associated with different water use strategies in different habitats, and the higher expression level of CrAQPs in coastal C. rosea plants might be an adaptive mechanism to deal with intracellular and extracellular water-deficit signals.;  This can be attributed to the fact that in roots the PIP proteins mainly facilitate water absorption from external environments, while in vines and leaves, the PIPs may play a larger role in transpiration.;  These data are especially helpful for characterizing AQP-interacting protein complexes involved in C. rosea’s adaptations to harsh environmental conditions such as low water availability and saline-alkaline soils.;  We assessed the overexpression of CrPIP1;5 in transgenic Arabidopsis, and CrPIP1;5 lead to slightly reduced saline-alkaline and drought tolerance, which showed the exact opposite phenotype compared with CrPIP2;3’s overexpression in Arabidopsis [36]. This also suggests that CrPIP1;5 could play a key role in water transport.;  Here we speculated that as a foreign AQP gene, CrPIP1;5 might be involved in modifying the function of endogenous PIPs of Arabidopsis, or function more in water flowing out than water absorption in transgenic Arabidopsis roots, thereby resulted in sensitivity to salt and drought stresses.;  We also found that high levels of salt, alkaline, and ABA slightly decreased the expression of CrPIP1;5 in C. rosea, this further suggests that this gene is highly important for water movement between cells and tissues, and is indeed involved in a stress response pathway that protects yeast cells or plants from water loss under high salinity conditions and promotes water release under high osmotic stress or drought (Figs. 8b and ​and9).9).;  While in C. rosea, our results about the expression pattern of CrPIP1;5 regarding to different tissues or habitats (Fig. 5), as well as the transcriptional changes responding to salinity/alkaline, high osmotic stress, and ABA treatment (Fig. 6a), indicated that CrPIP1;5 might be boiled down to a “housekeeping gene” for basic water homeostasis, to some degree.;  Even the CrPIP1;5 showed higher expression level in YX sample than in SCBG sample (leaves) (Fig. 5b), which might be probably due to the long-term adaptive mechanism that C. rosea plants on YX island have to deal with much tougher water-deficit adversities than plants in SCBG, including water absorption from the external environment and water transportation in vivo.;  The slightly decreased expression of CrPIP1;5 in C. rosea seedlings caused by stress factors or ABA (Fig. 6a), which might be an emergency protection for alleviating the damages caused by water disturbances, since we only checked the CrPIP1;5’s expression changes in 24 h challenged by different factors.;  For example, tobacco PIP1 member, NtAQP1, caused a decline of root hydraulic conductivity and decreased resistance of plants to water stress [57]. Transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants overexpressing AtPIP1;4 and AtPIP2;5 displayed rapid water loss under dehydration stress and showed enhanced water flow under drought stress [58]. The Glycine soja gene GsPIP2;1 negatively impact salt and drought stress tolerance by regulating water potential when overexpressed in transgenic Arabidopsis [44]. In addition, Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AcPIP2 (a PIP gene from saltbush A. canescens) exhibited drought-sensitive phenotypes [41]. This can be explained by the nature and intensity of stresses, combining with the cooperation between the over-expressed foreign AQPs and the endogenous AQPs.;  When the water-deficit stress signals were perceived, the foreign AQPs’ over-expression might affect the expression patterns and distribution of endogenous AQPs, and as a result the plant stress-responsive effects might vary among plant species.;  In our study, the over-expression of CrPIP1;5 showed some sensitivity both in yeast and in Arabidopsis, which only reflect CrPIP1;5 did involve in water stress responses in vivo.;  That, combined with our previous related research about CrPIP2;3 [36], suggested that overexpression of these two PIP genes in transgenic Arabidopsis promoted plant responses to abiotic stressors by maintaining water homeostasis, as well as decreasing the damage caused by water-deficit stress.;  Overall, as an active water channel protein with high expression levels in C. rosea different tissues or challenged by different factors, the CrPIP1;5, as well as the CrPIP2;3, might be basic sustainers for water homeostasis during the development of C. rosea plants.;  Our results will be helpful for understanding the involvement of this gene family in adaptation to stressful abiotic conditions, particularly through its impact on water balance.;  Although our results showed that overexpression of CrPIP1;5 could increase sensitivity to saline-alkaline and drought conditions in yeast and plants, combining the high and regulatable expression of CrPIP1;5 in C. rosea, it can be inferred that CrPIP1;5 is one of basic and important functional genes for facilitating water transportation in vivo, and might be involved in the C. rosea ecological adaptation to tropical coral reef.;  The C. rosea plants growing in SCBG were introduced gradually from coastal area in Hainan Province since 2012, and grew steadily for one to seven years with regular water and fertilizer supply in Guangzhou, China.;  In brief, for the high osmotic stress treatment, seedlings were removed from their pots and carefully washed with distilled water to remove soil from the roots, and then transferred into a 300 mM mannitol solution.;  For drought tolerance assay, thirty to forty plants of each OX lines and WT control were cultured in growth chamber as described above without watering for another 20 days, since the original vermiculite humidity could ensure regular growth of Arabidopsis plants.;  The water content of vermiculite in the pots was reduced over this timeframe but did not induce drought stress.;  The plants were then subjected to a drought tolerance assay by continuous withdrawing water, whereby WT and transgenic plants (OX 1#, OX 5#, and OX 10#) turned to continuous drought conditions for 10 days and then rewatered adequately and recovered for another 7 days."

"
"salt","D012492",35630403,9146400," In the present work, we examined the effects of salt and pH on the spectroscopic properties and thermal stability of LH1-RCs from Hlr. halochloris compared with its mesophilic counterpart, Hlr. abdelmalekii.;  Experiments in which the photocomplexes were subjected to different levels of salt or variable pH revealed that the thermal stability of LH1-RCs from both species was largely retained in the presence of high salt concentrations and/or at alkaline pH but was markedly reduced by lowering the salt concentration and/or pH.; In a previous study, we reported salt- and pH-sensitive interconvertible LH1 Qy band shifts of the purified LH1-RC complex from Hlr. halochloris [25] and demonstrated that the native spectral properties of the LH1-RC were maintained in the presence of high concentrations of salts and/or at alkaline pH (>7).;  During these experiments, it was observed that lowering the salt concentration and/or the pH induced Qy blue-shifts and decreased the band intensities, suggesting that the thermal stability of the Hlr. halochloris LH1-RC complex might also be controlled by salt or pH.;  Therefore, in the present study, we systematically examined the effects of salts and pH on the thermal stability of the LH1-RC complex from Hlr. halochloris and compared them with those from its mesophilic counterpart, Hlr. abdelmalekii.;  Salt concentrations were adjusted by extensive washing of the purified Hlr. halochloris and Hlr. abdelmalekii LH1-RCs with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.08% DDM and an indicated concentration of salts (0–1 M) by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra-15, Millipore). ;  For all experiments, sample concentrations were normalized with respect to the Qx band at 600 nm because this band was shown to be unaffected by salt concentration or pH.; Figure 1A,B show the absorption spectra of desalted LH1-RCs from Hlr. halochloris and Hlr. abdelmalekii at pH 8 after supplementation with 0–1 M NaCl.;  For Hlr. halochloris (Figure 1A), the desalted LH1 Qy band appeared at 956 nm in the absence of NaCl and was red-shifted as the NaCl concentration increased, reaching 1014 nm at 1 M NaCl.;  The salt-dependent and interconvertible spectral changes of the Hlr. halochloris LH1-RCs were largely comparable to those reported previously [25] but were significantly different from those observed for the mesophilic Hlr. abdelmalekii LH1-RCs, as shown in Figure 1B.;  At pH 8, the desalted LH1 Qy band of this species was not completely blue-shifted to ~955 nm.;  However, a salt-dependent and interconvertible spectral change was also confirmed for Hlr. abdelmalekii LH1-RCs when the buffer pH was decreased to 7 (Figure 1C).;  The LH1 Qy band appeared at 955 nm upon desalting and was red-shifted as the NaCl concentration increased, reaching 1002 nm at 1 M NaCl.;  These results suggest that although there may be a common mechanism responsible for the salt-dependent LH1 spectral shifts of Hlr. halochloris and Hlr. abdelmalekii, the salt requirements for maintaining the native spectral properties of the LH1-RCs differ in the two Halorhodospira species at a given pH. ;  The salt- and pH-dependent spectral changes of these Halorhodospira species were nonspecific to coexisting ion species and their valences [25], and distinct from the Ca2+-specific spectral changes of several BChl a-containing purple sulfur bacteria, including Tch. tepidum [27], Alc. tepidum [22], and Thiorhodovibrio strain 970 [28]. These results also support our previous conclusion that electrostatic charges control the LH1 Qy transition energies of LH1-RC complexes from Hlr. halochloris [25], as they likely do in Hlr. abdelmalekii as well.; To better understand the relation between electrostatic charge and protein stability, the effects of salt and pH on the thermal stability of LH1-RCs from Hlr. halochloris and Hlr. abdelmalekii were examined.;  As can be seen, the thermal stability of Hlr. halochloris LH1-RCs was largely retained in the presence of 1 M NaCl but markedly reduced as NaCl concentrations were decreased, indicating that the photocomplexes of this species require salt for thermal stability. ;  Thus, as one might expect considering the geochemical conditions in the habitat of Hlr. halochloris [3], the thermal stability of this organism’s photocomplexes is greatest at both elevated pH and salt concentration.; These salt- and pH-dependent effects on the thermal stabilization of purified Hlr. halochloris LH1-RCs were confirmed using photosynthetic membranes (chromatophores) in which LH1-RCs remain embedded in the lipid bilayer (Figure S1).;  These results suggest that the salt- and pH-dependent thermal stability of photocomplexes in this species is not closely associated with the transmembrane regions, but instead, with the surfaces of the LH1s and/or RCs where solvent molecules are readily accessible. ;  By contrast to Hlr. halochloris, thermal decomposition of Hlr. abdelmalekii LH1-RCs was rapid in the absence of NaCl at pH 8 (Figure 2G); even with salt present at pH 5, degradation was rapid, as in Hlr. halochloris (Figure 2D,I).;  The degrees of thermal stability of Hlr. halochloris and Hlr. abdelmalekii LH1-RCs seemed comparable at pH 8 if salt was present (Figure 2A,F).;  However, significant differences in thermal stability were apparent as salt levels decreased at pH 8 (Figure 2H) or when pH decreased in the presence of salt (Figure 2J); these differences are clearly seen in the life times obtained with a first-order kinetics analysis of each decay (Tables S1 and S2).; To further probe how electrostatic charge influences the thermal stability of Hlr. halochloris LH1-RC complexes, we tested the capacity of different sodium (Figure 3A) or chloride (Figure 3B) salts to substitute for NaCl.;  Upon incubation at 45 °C for 60 min in the presence of 500 mM of each sodium salt (Figure 3A), the LH1 Qy band intensity of Hlr. halochloris was largely retained by Na2SO4, only moderately affected by NaCl and CH3COONa, and was reduced by approximately half with NaHCO3 and NaNO3.;  Since sodium ions are present in each of these salts, the effect of each on thermal stability is attributed to anions in the order of SO42− > Cl− ≈ CH3COO− > HCO3− > NO3−. This order is in general agreement with the Hofmeister series—a classification of ions in order of their ability to solubilize proteins or stabilize secondary and tertiary structures of proteins [29,30]. A standard Hofmeister anion series is SO42− > HPO42− > CH3COO− > Cl− > NO3− > ClO3− > I− > ClO4− > SCN− [31], in which the most potent stabilizing anions are located on the left side of each pair.;  Curiously, however, the Hofmeister cation series is in opposition to the results obtained with different chloride salts; the ability of cations to stabilize the Hlr. halochloris LH1-RCs was in the order of Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+ > Sr2+ > K+ >> NH4+ (Figure 3B). ; The relative Qy band intensities of the Hlr. halochloris LH1-RCs in the presence of 500 mM of various sodium salts (A) or chlorides (B) after incubation at 45 °C and pH 8 for 60 min.; In a previous study, we proposed that two factors may responsible for the salt- and pH-dependent spectral changes of the Hlr. halochloris LH1-RCs [25]. The first is the axial ligand for Mg2+ of BChl b bound to LH1 β-polypeptide.; A second factor that may affect salt- and pH-dependent spectral changes in Hlr. halochloris LH1-RCs is LH1 α-Cys+3 [25]. Such a residue is rarely present near an α-BChl b-binding His0 and is replaced with Leu or Val in most purple bacteria other than Roseospirillum parvum [33,34]. Based on the pKa values of the Cys side chain (ranging from 2.9 to 9.8 inside proteins) [35] and its close association with LH1 BChl molecules [36], we proposed the side chain thiol/thiolate of α-Cys+3 as a candidate for modulating the point-charge around molecules of BChl b that trigger the pH-dependent interconvertible LH1 Qy band shifts of Hlr. halochloris [25]. The present study demonstrated that the Hlr. abdelmalekii LH1-RCs exhibited salt- and pH-dependent interconvertible spectral changes as well (Figure 1).;  Under high salt conditions, the thiolate anions may be surrounded by cations, thus disturbing the protonation of the thiolate anions and maintaining the red-shifted LH1 Qy bands.; It is known that halophilic Archaea such as Halobacterium store high intracellular concentrations of inorganic salts (primarily K+) for osmoregulation purposes under hypersaline conditions by balancing the excess positive charges present from molar concentrations of K+ [38]. In contrast, most halophilic Bacteria and eukaryotes accumulate organic compatible solutes [39] instead of inorganic salts for osmoregulation.; The salt- and pH-dependent stabilization of the LH1-RC from Halorhodospira species was confirmed not only in purified LH1-RCs but also in photosynthetic membranes (Figure S1).;  This indicates that surfaces of the LH1-RCs in contact with solvents (rather than transmembrane domains) are the regions of the proteins that sense and respond to changes in salt concentration and pH.;  In addition, LH1 BChl molecules that exhibit a salt- and pH-dependent spectral change are located on the C-terminal side (periplasmic side) of the photosynthetic membranes.;  These views are compatible with the observation that halophilic proteins show a biased amino acid composition on the protein surface, with a large excess of acidic residues and a reduced number of basic residues compared to corresponding proteins from nonhalophiles [46,48]. The highly negative charges of the abundant acidic residues on the halophilic protein surfaces improve their solubility and flexibility at high salt concentrations and allow them to function normally.;  By contrast, their electrostatic repulsions are thought to be a major factor responsible for the pronounced instability of proteins at lower salt concentrations [45], consistent with the present salt-dependent destabilization of the Hlr. halochloris and Hlr. abdelmalekii LH1-RC complexes (Figure 2C,H).;  Therefore, cations of salts may help stabilize the excess negative charges on the surfaces of halophilic LH1-RCs. ; Halophilic proteins maintain functionally active conformations in the presence of high concentrations of kosmotropic ions (small size, high surface charge density, strong hydration and forming water structures) but become inactive in the presence of high concentrations of chaotropic salts (large size, low surface charge density, weak hydration and breaking water structures) [30,51]. These high concentrations of coexisting anions and cations may affect the water structure on halophilic proteins, as discussed in Section 4.2.;  By contrast, the Hofmeister cation series was in opposition to our results obtained with different chloride salts (Figure 3).; The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/microorganisms10050959/s1, Table S1: Lifetimes for the thermal degradation of the LH1-RC complexes from Hlr. halochloris and Hlr. abdelmalekii at pH 8 in the presence of indicated concentration of NaCl; Table S2: Lifetimes for the thermal degradation of the LH1-RC complexes from Hlr. halochloris and Hlr. abdelmalekii in the presence of 1M NaCl at various pHs; Figure S1: The relative Qy band intensities of Hlr. halochloris chromatophores in the presence of 4 M NaCl (A) or in the absence of NaCl (B) after incubation at the indicated pH and temperature for 60 min; Figure S2: Phototrophic growth curves for Hlr. halochloris in the presence of 3 M NaCl (black) or 3M KCl (purple) or in the absence of salts (gray) monitored as LH1 Qy peak intensity at 1020 nm."

Here we introduce a new concept for the storage/transport of microorganisms
by using ice recrystallization inhibiting poly(vinyl alcohol) in tandem
with poly(ethylene glycol).;  This cryopreserving formulation is shown
to result in a 4-fold increase in E. coli yield post-thaw,
compared to glycerol, utilizing lower concentrations, and successful
cryopreservation shown as low as 1.1 wt % of additive.;  The mechanism
of protection is demonstrated to be linked not only to inhibiting
ice recrystallization (by comparison to a recombinant antifreeze protein)
but also to the significantly lower toxicity of the polymers compared
to glycerol.; Cryopreservation traditionally requires the addition of organic
solvents to mitigate the damage caused by ice formation and growth
as well as membrane rupture and osmotic stress which would otherwise
lead to cell death.10,11 For mammalian cells, dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) is the most widely employed cryoprotectant for both
slow freezing and vitrification (depending on the DMSO concentration),
and for bacteria, glycerol is typically used.; This paper takes inspiration from extremophile organisms
to demonstrate
successful bacterial cryopreservation using a unique all-polymer,
glycerol-free, formulation.;  This formulation benefits from a synergistic
effect of an ice growth inhibiting polymer with a secondary hydrophilic
polymer, and they outperform the current gold-standard glycerol, leading
to increased cell yields at low cryoprotectant concentrations.; Different molecular weight PEGs
(100 mg mL–1; 200 Da, 400 Da, 1.5 kDa, 4 kDa, 6
kDa, and 8 kDa) and PVAs (1 mg mL–1; 10, 23, and
31 kDa) were dissolved in PBS for comparison in cryoprotective activity
alongside poly(isopropenyl acetate-alt-maleic anhydride)
functionalized with (dimethylamino)ethanol (poly(ampholyte)), AFPIII,
and glycerol.;  It is important
to note that PVA and PEG were particularly of interest as they are
low-cost (comparable to glycerol), are available in a range of molecular
weights, and are produced to food/clinical grades, making them ideal
for translational applications.44 The polymers’
IRI activity was evaluated by a modified splat assay (Figure ​Figure11B–G).; To evaluate the performance of these IRI active polymers
versus
glycerol, a series of cryopreservation experiments were undertaken.;  This was chosen to mimic laboratory conditions where stocks are
often frozen and thawed during routine use. 25% glycerol resulted
in an average of 15 recovered colonies compared to 1 for no added
cryoprotectant.;  PVA, AFP, and the poly(ampholyte) alone gave results
identical to those with no cryoprotectant added. (It should be noted
that the concentrations of each of the above were chosen based on
their relative IRI activity to give similar effects, not at equal
mass concentration to enable us to correlate the physical properties
to the observed biological responses.) Our previous work using red
blood cells (which also have no nucleus, like bacteria) has shown
that IRI active polymers increased post-thaw recovery only when used
in combination with a hydrating secondary cryoprotectant such as polymer
gels or hydroxyethyl starch.40,41 PEG was therefore added
(due to biocompatibility and commercial availability), and the mixture
PEG/PVA (100 mg mL–1 + 1 mg mL–1) was found to dramatically increase recovery to 69 colony forming
units, which is a >4-fold increase compared to glycerol alone.
PEG/AFP
mixtures lead to similar results (52 colonies), supporting the hypothesis
that controlling IRI is the key mechanism in protecting bacteria during
cryopreservation, by reducing ice growth especially during thawing.
The poly(ampholyte)s, however, showed no cryoprotective effect, despite
them previously being used for mammalian cells, where they appear
to function via cell membrane interactions.37 Poly(ampholyte)s have far weaker IRI than PVA or AFPs, and hence
this supports a mechanism of protection based on limiting ice recrystallization
rather than membrane plasticization/stabilization.;  Concentrations of cryoprotectants: [glycerol]
= 25 wt %; [AFPIII] = 1 mg mL–1; [PVA] = 1 mg mL–1; [PEG/AFPIII] = 100 + 0.01 mg mL–1; [PEG/PVA] = 100 + 1 mg mL–1; [poly(ampholyte)]
= 50 mg mL–1).; A key challenge associated with
the use of glycerol is its intrinsic
toxicity at cryopreservation concentrations, so the impact of incubating
the polymers with E. coli compared to glycerol was
evaluated.;  However, it is important to note that 10 mg mL–1 PEG with 1 mg mL–1 PVA is just
a 1.1 wt % solution but performs equally to 25 wt % glycerol, which
represents a remarkable cryopreservation outcome with a 25-fold reduction
in cryoprotectant.;  Post-freeze/thaw in either 25% glycerol or PEG/PVA
resulted in 15–18% of the E. coli retaining
intact membranes.;  These observations suggest that the mechanisms of
cryoinjury of both glycerol and our macromolecular antifreezes are
very similar.;  However, the colony counting results (Figure ​Figure22) confirmed the polymer approach
to be superior, supporting a hypothesis that the reduced toxicity
of the polymers means that more and healthier colonies can grow post-thaw,
and reduced growth inhibition compared to glycerol.; Normalized
cell recovery for three different bacteria upon addition
of different cryoprotectants after seven freeze (−196 °C)–thaw
(20 °C) cycles (red = control, blue = glycerol, black = PEG/PVA).
Values obtained are normalized to themselves.; In all cases, the PEG/PVA mixture gave equal or better
levels of
recovery than glycerol alone.;  It was noted that M. smegmatis (which is a slow-growing organism compared to other two) gave fewer
colonies after a fixed period of growth in all conditions, but the
PEG/PVA still matched the performance of glycerol.;  These results demonstrate the versatile nature
of this approach and that replacing glycerol in laboratories with
this polymer formulation is a reliable way to match or improve current
storage methods.;  E. coli was frozen with the indicated formulations
and post-thaw inoculated into LB media, and their growth was monitored.
After seven freeze–thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen, cells cryopreserved
in 25% glycerol and PEG/PVA (100 and 1 mg mL–1,
respectively) had essentially identical growth rates (Figure ​Figure55), which were faster than all
the other formulations used.;  It was found that bacterial recovery
was similar for 25% glycerol and PEG/PVA after 1 week storage, which
supports the use of this method for routine laboratory manipulations.
For 4 week storage we noted that the glycerol formulation yielded
more colonies, but this was not optimized, and significant recovery
was still possible with the polymer-only mixture.;  It should be noted
that the glycerol solution did not fully freeze at −20 °C,
thus providing a carbon source to the E. coli.;  It is shown that PEG/PVA mixtures
provide a synergistic effect with the number of recovered bacterial
colonies after seven freeze–thaw cycles being up to 4-fold
higher than the current gold standard of glycerol."

In this endeavour, biotechnology can significantly help with the transition to greener pulp production industrial processes."
"ClO2","D002713",36362210,9654485," In this work, a novel highly thermo and alkaline-tolerant xylanase from Pseudothermotoga thermarum was overproduced in E. coli and tested as a bleaching booster of hardwood kraft pulps to save chlorine dioxide (ClO2) during ECF bleaching.;  The extremozyme-stage (EXZ) was carried out at 90 °C and pH 10.5 and optimised at lab scale on an industrial oxygen-delignified eucalyptus pulp, enabling us to save 15% ClO2 to reach the mill brightness, and with no detrimental effect on paper properties.;  Then, the EXZ-assisted bleaching sequence was validated at pilot scale under industrial conditions, achieving 25% ClO2 savings and reducing the generation of organochlorinated compounds (AOX) by 18%, while maintaining pulp quality and papermaking properties.; During kraft pulping, short xylan chains precipitate at the surface of the fibres acting as a physical barrier against the action of the bleaching agents [9], leading to substantial consumption of ClO2.;  One enzyme in particular, Xyn11, a xylanase from Pseudothermotoga thermarum, showed an exceptional xylanolytic activity at 90 °C and pH 10.5 [11]. Here, this extremophilic enzyme (extremozyme) is integrated in an industrial ECF bleaching sequence of eucalyptus kraft pulp with the aim of increasing pulp bleachability and reducing the need for ClO2 as bleaching agent.; The novel extremophilic xylanase Xyn11 from Pseudothermotoga thermarum, with max. activity at pH 10.5 and 90 °C [11], was assayed as a pretreatment stage (EXZ) of industrial oxygen-delignified eucalyptus kraft pulp with the objective of saving ClO2, and compared with the conventional industrial bleaching sequence (D0EpD1D2) (Figure 1).;  Three different sets of experiments were carried out to evaluate the effect of introducing an enzymatic stage in the bleaching process and to optimise a xylanase-aided bleaching sequence: EXP (1) optimisation of the duration of the enzymatic stage at the optimal conditions for the activity of the enzyme; EXP (2) reduction in the amount of ClO2 required for bleaching the pulp; and EXP (3) evaluation of different extremophilic xylanases.; Given the well reported savings of ClO2, by applying an enzymatic pretreatment on pulp [5,6,7,9], three different ClO2 loads (reduced by 15%, 20% and 25% with respect to the ClO2 required in the conventional sequence) were assayed.; Brightness levels (after D2) obtained with the different ClO2 loads (Figure 3) showed that 15% of ClO2 can be saved to reach a brightness level of 88.4% ISO, higher than the industrial reference, by adding the 5 h-prebleaching stage with Xyn11.;  The results obtained for the control pulp with 15% less ClO2 (87.2% ISO) confirmed the positive effect of the EXZ stage on pulp bleachability.; Final pulp brightness (after D2) obtained after 5 h prebleaching stage with Xyn11 (green) followed by bleaching with reference ClO2 load or with 15%, 20% or 25% less ClO2 in each D step, compared with the corresponding controls (grey).; Three xylanases, namely Xyn11, a commercial xylanase (Com-X2) and a mix of both (XMIX), were tested as prebleaching stages of the O2-delignified eucalyptus kraft pulp using the optimised conditions: 5 h of enzymatic treatment (EXP1) and 15% less ClO2 in D stages (EXP2).; Final pulp brightness obtained after 5 h prebleaching stage with different xylanases followed by 15% less ClO2 applied in each D step of the bleaching sequence.; Figure 5 shows the papermaking properties of the enzymatically bleached pulps refined with 2000 revolutions (to obtain a drainage index close to the 30 °SR of the market bleached pulp) compared to that of control pulp (with no ClO2 savings and no enzyme addition).; Papermaking properties obtained for pulps pretreated with different xylanases and bleached with 15% less ClO2 compared to the control pulp (no xylanase addition) at laboratory scale.; Taking into account the good pulp brightness level (89.0% ISO) obtained by 3 h treatment with Xyn11 (Figure 2), and given that Xyn11 stage has no detrimental effect on pulp properties, the possibility of saving ClO2 with a shorter enzymatic treatment (3 h instead of 5 h) was evaluated.;  Again, 15% less ClO2 was added at each D stage of the bleaching sequence (D0EpD1D2).;  Three hours of enzymatic treatment were enough to exceed (88.7% ISO) the brightness of the mill reference (88.1% ISO), even when 15% less ClO2 was used in the bleaching sequence, confirming the bleaching potential of Xyn11 (Figure 6).; Comparison of pulp brightness obtained after 3 h pretreatment with Xyn11 (green) or without enzyme (control, grey) followed by conventional bleaching sequence applying reference or 15% less ClO2 loadings; and with 15% less ClO2 but without EXZ step (No EXZ step, black).;  The reference industrial bleaching sequence increased the brightness of the pulp to 89.0% ISO, with 100% ClO2 used.;  In contrast, the integration of the EXZ stage in the bleaching sequence allowed us to reach 91.1% ISO brightness after D2 stage, using 15% less ClO2 (Table 1), thus confirming it is possible to save ClO2 and outperform the reference industrial brightness.;  Therefore, additional ClO2 savings are achievable.;  Indeed, it is possible to save 25% of ClO2 by suppressing the final D2 bleaching stage in the EXZ-aided bleaching sequence.; Final properties of the O2-Delignified eucalyptus kraft pulp (after D2 bleaching stage) for the enzymatic sequence (EXZD0EpD1D2) using less 15% ClO2, and for the reference sequence (D0EpD1D2) with ClO2 reference loading.; The kappa number of the pulp, measured after the extraction stage (Ep), decreased with the enzymatic pretreatment, suggesting more lignin was released from the fibres even when 15% less ClO2 was applied in D0 stage.; Papermaking properties obtained for the pulp bleached with the Xyn11-assited sequence with 15% ClO2 savings (green) in relation to the control (with no xylanase addition) at pilot scale.;  As expected, the EXZ stage did not generate absorbable organic halides (AOX) and, due to the reduction in the ClO2 charge in each D stage, the total AOX content in the effluent was reduced by 18% at the end of the enzymatic sequence.;  Thus, for the trials with less 15% ClO2, washed and non-washed pulps were used to evaluate the effect of the original filtrates on Xyn11 performance (Figure 8).;  The introduction of the Xyn11 stage allowed savings of 15% ClO2 in the bleaching sequence.;  Both enzymatically treated pulps bleached with 15% less ClO2 had higher brightness levels than the mill reference (87.8% ISO), suggesting that higher ClO2 savings may be possible.; Next, the pulp was bleached at different stages with a combination of ClO2, H2O2 and NaOH, using the conventional bleaching sequence of the mill (D0EpD1D2).;  Total ClO2 used in D-stages varied between 3.0% and 3.2% o.d. pulp, with a total duration of 325 min at 75 °C.;  The subsequent D0EpD1D2 sequence was applied with the same conditions as for the reference sequence, except the ClO2 charge (which is reduced by 15% in each D stage as performed at laboratory scale).;  A pilot-scale validation of the extremozyme-assisted sequence on eucalyptus kraft pulp under relevant industrial conditions indicated that 25% ClO2 savings are made possible by removing the last D2 stage, while maintaining even higher pulp brightness than the mill reference, and with no detrimental effect on the pulp mechanical properties.;  Additional benefits from the reduction of the amount of ClO2 added in each D stage are the significant decrease in AOX content and a higher biodegradability of the bleaching effluent.; These excellent results were confirmed on a mixed hardwoods kraft pulp, obtaining similar ClO2 savings, and proving that the enzymatic stage could be directly applied at industrial level without major changes to the current pulp production process."
"oxygen","D010100",36362210,9654485," The extremozyme-stage (EXZ) was carried out at 90 °C and pH 10.5 and optimised at lab scale on an industrial oxygen-delignified eucalyptus pulp, enabling us to save 15% ClO2 to reach the mill brightness, and with no detrimental effect on paper properties.;  For instance, xylanase treatment of pulp after oxygen delignification has been shown to be effective in some ECF sequences [5,6,7,8], allowing fewer bleaching chemicals to be used, which has economic benefits.; The novel extremophilic xylanase Xyn11 from Pseudothermotoga thermarum, with max. activity at pH 10.5 and 90 °C [11], was assayed as a pretreatment stage (EXZ) of industrial oxygen-delignified eucalyptus kraft pulp with the objective of saving ClO2, and compared with the conventional industrial bleaching sequence (D0EpD1D2) (Figure 1).; Here, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the effluent increased after EXZ stage, most probably due to the higher release of hemicellulose-derived sugars (mainly from xylans) and lignin-based compounds by Xyn11 treatment.;  The overall biological oxygen demand (BOD) of the effluent from the EXZ-assisted sequence was, however, slightly higher.;  Dissolved oxygen level (set point: 30%) was monitored throughout the cultivation with Hamilton VisiFerm DO ARC 120 (Hamilton).; In order to guarantee the chemical integrity and quality of the pulp during the transportation, and considering that the filtrates obtained after oxygen delignification are classified as hazardous substances, which could lead to a considerable delay in the transportation and could compromise the pulp quality, the pilot trial was carried out with washed O2 delignified eucalyptus kraft pulp, obtained directly from the mill (Portugal)."
"agar","D000362",31938738,6953635," Isolation was done on alkaline media (Potato dextrose agar, Malt extract agar, Oatmeal agar and Sabouraud dextrose agar).;  Malt extract agar, Sabourauds dextrose agar, potato dextrose agar and oatmeal agar supported growth of most of the fungi both in high and low nutrient composition.;  Positive protease activity was observed in 8 of the isolates by way of a clearance zone around colony on casein agar.; Antimicrobial activity (inhibition zones) of crude extract from isolate 11M screened against test organisms using agar well diffusion method on plates.; Antimicrobial activity (inhibition zones) of cell free extract from isolate 11M screened against test organisms using agar well diffusion method on plates.;  High and low nutrient media prepared from Malt extract agar, Oatmeal agar, Sabouraud dextrose agar and Potato dextrose agar showed varied results in terms of the number of isolates obtained.;  The same scenario was observed for PDA and oat meal agar.;  Serially diluted samples (0.1 g in 1 ml of sterile lake water) were plated onto Potato dextrose agar (PDA), Malt extract agar (MEA), Oatmeal agar and Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) with chloramphenicol (100 mg/L) as an antibiotic to inhibit bacterial growth.;  An aliquot (3μl) of the recovered DNA was run on 1% agarose to confirm the presence and quality.;  An aliquot of 5μl of the PCR products was run on a 1 % agarose gel stained with Cyber green in 1× TAE buffer and visualized under ultraviolet.;  The antimicrobial assay was done using the agar well diffusion method (Rajpal et al., 2016) on Muller Hinton agar (pH 8 and 5% NaCl).;  The fungal isolates were also tested for antagonistic effect against common fungal plant pathogens to determine their potential as biocontrol agents using agar well diffusion method.;  Isolates that showed positive antimicrobial activity in primary screening were qualitatively selected for secondary screening using agar well diffusion method on Muller Hinton agar."
"NaCl","D012965",38225962,10788403," Most strains tolerated pH 8–10 and salt content at 5–7% NaCl concentration.;  Extremophiles can live in some of the most aggressive environments on the Earth, e.g. with salinity (halophiles: 0.5–5.2 M NaCl), pH (acidophiles: pH < 4, alkaliphiles: pH > 9) and temperature (psychrophiles: –20 °C to 20 °C, thermophiles: 60–115 °C) [9], [10], [11]. Krishna et al. investigated the bacterial diversity of bauxite residue (pH = 11.1) for the first time and identified ten bacterial species in Indian bauxite residue [12]. These strains were alkalitolerant, positive for one or more of the enzyme activities tested, and able to produce organic acids and oxidise a wide range of carbon substrates, which implies their potential application in either bioleaching processes or in the treatment of the BR itself, intending to mitigate its alkalinity [7,13].;  This strain was alkaliphilic with a pH optimum of 10 and tolerated NaCl up to 7.5 w/v% [14]. Other strains and their characterisation were reported from Brazil, India and China [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. Most bacterial strains belonged to the genus Bacillus, although several have been re-categorised to another genus [22]. Fewer reports are available for fungal strains: two Penicillium [17,23] and one Trichoderma
[16] species have been identified from BRs.; We used three types of microbial media for strain isolation: alkalophilic Horikoshi agar (10 g/L glucose, 1 g/L yeast extract, 0.2 g/L K2HPO4, 0.2 g/L Mg2SO4·7H2O, 10 g/L Na2CO3, 20 g/L agar, pH 9 and 10) for the isolation of alkaliphilic microorganisms [11], nutrient agar (15 g/L peptone, 3 g/L yeast extract, 6 g/L NaCl, 1 g/L dextrose, 15 g/L agar, pH 7.2 and 9) as a general purpose medium and malt agar (20 g/L malt extract, 1 g/L peptone, 1 g/L glucose, 20 g/L agar, pH 5.8 and 9) targeting the isolation of fungi.;  First, 10 mL sterile NaCl solution was added (0.85%) to 1 g BR and was shaken at 180 rpm for 30 min.; We carried out the tolerance studies of the BR-derived strains by modifying the methods described by Kutasi et al. [60]. We measured the strains’ pH (5–10) tolerance in a modified nutrient media (10 g/L peptone, 3 g/L yeast extract, 6 g/L NaCl, 5 g/L glucose).;  The following salt concentrations were tested: 0%, 0.6%, 1%, 3%, 5% and 7% NaCl.;  Heatmap diagrams of pH, NaCl concentration and temperature tolerance were performed with the seaborn (0.11.2) and matplotlib (3.5.2) Python packages.; Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are polymers that mainly protect microbial cells [64]. We assessed the EPS production capacity of the strains according to Kutasi et al. [60]. We inoculated 30 mL media (0.51% KNO3, 0.1% K2HPO4, 0.08% KH2PO4, 0.04% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.002% FeSO4·7H2O, 0.001% CaCl2, 0.001% MnSO4, 0.1% NaCl, 0.01% yeast extract, 0.01% tryptone, 0.01% bacto peptone, l mL/L salt solution containing 0.3 g H3BO3, 0.2 g CoCl2·6H2O, 0.1 g ZnSO4·7H2O, 30 mg Na2MoO4·2H2O, 20 mg NiCl2·6H2O, 10 mg CuSO4·5H2O, in 1 L 1 N HCl, pH = 7.0) with three loops of 24 h or 48 h old microbe (cultured at 30 °C on slant agar) in 50 mL Falcon tubes.;  BRHUB1, BRHUB6, BRHUB8, BRHUF1 and BRHUF3 showed intensive replication at NaCl content of up to 3% (0.51 M) and tolerated salt content of up to 5% (0.86 M).;  Our strain tolerated pH up to 10 and grew at a salt content of 12–15%, a good candidate for extremophilic characteristics (alkaliphiles pH > 9 [11], halophiles 0.5–5.2 M NaCl [10]. R. beringensis can be applied for biohydrogen production [82], and its close relative, Bacillus coreaensis, is capable of xylan hydrolysis [83]. Alkalihalophilus pseudofirmus (BRHUB7) (synonym: Alkalihalobacillus pseudofirmus, Bacillus pseudofirmus) is alkalophilic and halotolerant, first isolated from soil and then found in various environments [76]. Our strain grew at pH 7–10 and tolerated 5–10% NaCl concentration.;  They have been isolated from the marine environment and salt marshes (our strain could reproduce well at up to 5% NaCl and tolerate 7% salt in the media), and they are resistant to metals, such as Al, As, Ni, etc. [93]. Several authors have found Gammaproteobacteria [28,31] and Pseudomonas species [12,13,20,27] in BRs.; Microbes tolerating 0.2–0.5 M NaCl, which is 1.2–2.9% NaCl, can be categorised as weakly halophilic, while moderately halophilic grow at 0.5‒2.5 M (3‒14.4%), borderline extremely halophilic at 1.5‒4 M (8.8‒29.2%) and extreme halophilic at 2.5‒5.2 M (14.4‒30.4%) [10,127]. Halophiles require salt to grow, unlike halotolerant microorganisms, which can grow without salt.;  Halotolerants tolerate salt content up to 2.5 M (14.4%) or even more [127]. All strains tolerated 5% NaCl (or above) (except for BRHUB3 and BRHUB4); thus, they can be categorised as moderately halophilic, but only BRHUB3, BRHUB7, and BRHU9 required salt for their growth.; Studying adaptation strategies of extremophilic organisms to extreme environments, such as the high pH, NaCl salt content, and the metal-rich conditions found in bauxite residues, may provide insights into their unique adaptations and survival strategies."

"PHAs","D054813",34322108,8312272," A sustainable and biodegradable solution can be found in Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), a microbially produced biopolymer.;  Bacteria from the phylum Actinobacteria were found to contain the PhaC Class II genotype which produces medium-chain length PHAs, a physiology until now only found within a few Pseudomonas species.;  The need for biodegradable and sustainable alternatives has, therefore, become critical with microbially produced polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) showing significant promise as an economically viable replacement for petroleum-based plastic (Meereboer et al., 2020).; Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a group of microbially-made polyesters: 100% biodegradable, thermoplastic, insoluble in water, non-toxic and biocompatible.;  Prokaryotic species that produce PHAs are broad and include many bacteria, such as Alcaligenes latus, Ralstonia eutropha, Azotobacter beijerinckii, Bacillus megaterium and Pseudomonas oleovorans (Bhuwal et al., 2013; Anjum et al., 2016), as well as several archaea from the family Halobacteriaceae (Han et al., 2010; Hermann-Krauss et al., 2013).;  PHAs are produced by microorganisms as a form of intracellular energy storage, within the microbial cytoplasm, and manifests when there is an excess supply of carbon but other essential nutrients, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus are deficient (Laycock et al., 2014).; The types of PHAs produced by individual microorganisms are categorized by the number of carbon atoms within the monomer units that form the PHA polymer: short-chain length (SCL) PHAs consist of 3–5 carbon atoms, medium-chain length (MCL) PHAs with 6–14 carbon atoms and PHAs with > 14 carbon atoms are considered long-chain length (LCL) (Sagong et al., 2018).;  The mechanical properties of PHAs are influenced by the carbon length of the monomers, SCL-PHAs due to their crystalline structure, are generally stiff, brittle and have poor thermal stability, requiring modified processing approaches for an improved product (Wang et al., 2016).;  In comparison, MCL-PHAs have good thermos-elastomeric properties but are mainly limited to bacteria from the family Pseudomonadaceae (Oliveira et al., 2020).;  LCL-PHAs are rare and only produced by Pseudomonas strains (Meereboer et al., 2020) and have seen less interest within the area of bioplastic development (Muneer et al., 2020).;  As an example, PHAs have physical properties similar to synthetic polyethylene and polypropylene (polyolefins) which are used extensively in single-plastic use products which are at higher risk of becoming waste.;  The composition of the monomers is tied to the substrate specificity of the individual PhaC enzyme, and PHAs with novel monomer compositions are constantly being discovered from bacteria in various environments (Sharma et al., 2017).;  PHA with co-polymer composition have been observed to possess better physical properties compared to homopolymer SCL-PHAs (Chek et al., 2017; Ray and Kalia, 2017).; PhaC genotypes appeared in a broad number of bacterial and archaeal genomes, consisting of 24.8 and 17.5%, respectively of the genome datasets, suggesting that PHAs are a relatively conserved form of carbon energy storage within bacteria (Serafim et al., 2018) and archaea (Wang et al., 2019b).;  Class II PhaCs are of particular interest as they are the only PhaC class capable of producing MCL-PHAs and bacteria that generate MCL-PHAs are mainly Pseudomonas which consists of almost all of the Proteobacteria PhaC II genotypes that were found in this study (Mozejko-Ciesielska et al., 2019).;  MCL-PHAs have not had widespread production due to requiring expensive carbon sources needed for Pseudomonas PHA production, meaning cheaper compatible feedstocks were needed to be found (Tanikkul et al., 2020), or recombinant strains are required to utilize inexpensive industry by-products as substrates (Löwe et al., 2017).;  Since raw materials can account for 40–48% of production costs, bioprospecting for Actinobacteria Class II PhaC genotypes could potentially kickstart industrial levels of MCL-PHAs through the use of inexpensive feedstock (Schmidt et al., 2016).;  Soda lakes are the prime example of this ecosystem type being saline, high pH environments with high amounts of available carbon in the form of carbonates and bicarbonates, often with limited levels of nitrogen compounds—conditions that favor the production of PHAs (Ogato et al., 2015).;  Utilizing halophile PHA producers conveys several advantages in this regard: a high salinity environment can undergo continuous fermentation in an open unsterile environment which reduces operating costs, they can use various inexpensive feedstocks to produce PHAs and due to high intracellular osmotic pressure of halophiles, they can be lysed using tap/municipal water for easy PHA extraction (Mitra et al., 2020)."

"lipids","D008055",32155764,7084678,"Archaea, the most extremophilic domain of life, contain ether and branched lipids which provide extraordinary bilayer properties.;  We determined the structural characteristics of diether archaeal-like phospholipids as functions of hydration and temperature by neutron diffraction.;  In this study, we detected non-lamellar phases of archaeal-like lipids at low hydration levels, and lamellar phases at levels of 90% relative humidity or more exclusively.;  Furthermore, the water uptake of the lipids examined was remarkably high.;  We discuss the effect of ether linkages and branched lipids on the exceptional characteristics of archaeal phospholipids.;  To sustain these extreme conditions, phospholipids that assemble the archaeal membranes are unique and differ from usual bacterial lipids.;  Archaeal lipids consist of an sn-glycerol-1-phosphate backbone, ether linkages, and phytanyl hydrocarbon chains, while most bacterial lipids include an sn-glycerol-3-phosphate backbone, ester linkages, and straight acyl chains [1,2]. Both phytanyl chains and ether linkages impact the physicochemical properties of lipids.; Ether lipids have been investigated much less than DPhPC so far and only scarce information is available.;  For example, it is known that ether bonds are more stable than ester bonds, conferring higher resistance to hydrolysis [10]. Since ether oxygens are less polar than ester bonds, the solvation and hydrogen bonding of DPhPC and its ether analogue DoPhPC may be different, impacting on the mechanics and electrostatics of the interfacial layer [11]. Lastly, although phosphatidylcholine is the universal membrane component, in native membranes it is always accompanied by phospholipids with other headgroups such as phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE).;  A change in the headgroup modifies electrostatic energies, water incorporation, and the gel-to-liquid transition temperature [12]. For example, since the choline head group possesses methyl groups, it does not allow close oxygen and nitrogen contacts, contrary to the ammonium group that forms strong electrostatic and hydrogen bonds between oxygen and nitrogen [13]. Consequently, PE lipids are stiffer than phosphocholine (PC) lipids, as demonstrated in diphytanoyl lipids [11]. Furthermore, the distinct headgroups modulate the bending modulus of the lipid bilayer inducing particular curvatures [14,15]. For example, while DPhPC is the only diphytanoyl lipid that produces stable lipid multilayers in oriented samples, DPhPE’s negative curvature is so important that the lipid alone self-assembles under non-lamellar phases, such as cubic and hexagonal phases [16]. Nevertheless, lipid mixtures containing DPhPC and up to 50% of DPhPE form unilamellar vesicles [13]. ;  If lipids with a phosphocholine polar headgroup remained to be identified in archaea, those with a phosphoethanolamine headgroup were frequent in methanogens and archaeoglobales.;  This choice of archaeal lipid analogues was motivated by the fact that these synthetic lipids are commercially available as pure compounds, thus their composition is known exactly, they are not prone to non-reproducible mixtures, and they have suitable electrical charges.; Sketch of the structures of the lipids used, 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DoPhPC) and 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DoPhPE).; The lipids hydrated above 90% RH arrange as a system self-organized under lamellar phases and up to four Bragg orders were easily detected.;  Nevertheless, these four orders, compared to the bacterial lipids which can commonly reach 10 orders [20], are indicative of a system with little order, probably due to their intrinsically disordered hydrocarbon chains.;  Although the phytanoyl chains were positioned perpendicularly to the bilayer plane similarly to the acyl chains of bacterial lipids, their distribution was broader, showing a higher disorder in the hydrophobic region [8,21].

(1998) even found that some of the chains may be parallel to the bilayer plane.;  Neutron scattering length density (NSLD) profiles present the conventional shape for a lipid bilayer: a main peak from the headgroup region of the phospholipids, a central region that corresponds to the hydrophobic chains of the bilayer, and a minimum density from the terminal methyl.;  Interestingly, the uptake of the number of water molecules (16.2 ± 0.2) is much higher than in usual bacterial straight lipids (6.5 for DPPC [24]), and also slightly higher than in ester branched lipids (14.5 for DPhPC [25]), which was probably due to the presence of DoPhPE in the system.; The lipid bilayer consisting of ether lipids and branched chains was insensitive to the change of temperature from 25 °C to 40 °C (Table 2).;  Conversely, the 2Dc from lipids formed by linear acyl chains decreased at higher temperatures due to a higher thermal disorder [23].; The synthetic archaeal lipids, 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, USA).;  These lipids have the same characteristics as archaeal monopolar lipids.;  DoPhPC is an ether lipid, to which we added a portion of DoPhPE, an electrically neutral molecule with a particular small headgroup, to mimic the mixture of lipids of the cell membrane.; Our aim was to study the effect of hydration and temperature on ordered multistack layers of a mixture of archaeal-like lipids.;  We used a mixture of DoPhPC:DoPhPE (9:1, mol:mol), which are synthetic archaeal lipids with characteristics similar to natural archaeal monopolar lipids.;  These synthetic lipids are available commercially (>98% purity) and served as a model, as their composition was known exactly which makes the sample preparation reproducible.;  Since both lipids have the same core regions, we could not distinguish the relative contribution of each lipid, but there was no evidence of a liquid-liquid phase separation, so it seems reasonable to assume that all lipids participated similarly whatever the temperature and hydration conditions were.;  Such findings underline the rather high resistance of these specific lipids against temperature.;  Although archaeal lipid bilayers with inositol headgroups have been shown to be less hydrated than conventional PC lipids [34], this study showed that archaeal-like lipids with PC and PE headgroups present a higher hydration than bacterial lipids.;  With respect to the role of ether polyisoprenoid lipids in archaeal biology, our study is one of the first to concentrate on bilayer forming archaeal lipids.;  Our results clearly show that these lipids self-assemble into stable bilayers, in which thermal stability largely exceeds that of the equivalent bacterial lipids, even if we did not determine up to which extrema they would be able to resist.;  One could speculate that other archaeal lipids would present similar properties if they contained related headgroups, as is the case for classical lipids.;  Moreover, studies with a broader distribution of lipids, or lipids extracted directly from archaeal membranes, would be mandatory to verify that our results still apply to them."
"phospholipids","D010743",32155764,7084678," We determined the structural characteristics of diether archaeal-like phospholipids as functions of hydration and temperature by neutron diffraction.;  We discuss the effect of ether linkages and branched lipids on the exceptional characteristics of archaeal phospholipids.;  To sustain these extreme conditions, phospholipids that assemble the archaeal membranes are unique and differ from usual bacterial lipids.;  For example, it is known that ether bonds are more stable than ester bonds, conferring higher resistance to hydrolysis [10]. Since ether oxygens are less polar than ester bonds, the solvation and hydrogen bonding of DPhPC and its ether analogue DoPhPC may be different, impacting on the mechanics and electrostatics of the interfacial layer [11]. Lastly, although phosphatidylcholine is the universal membrane component, in native membranes it is always accompanied by phospholipids with other headgroups such as phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE).;  Neutron scattering length density (NSLD) profiles present the conventional shape for a lipid bilayer: a main peak from the headgroup region of the phospholipids, a central region that corresponds to the hydrophobic chains of the bilayer, and a minimum density from the terminal methyl."
"lipid bilayers","D008051",32155764,7084678," Hydration and temperature are both crucial parameters for the self-assembly and physicochemical properties of lipid bilayers.; Due to the important effects of headgroups in the physical properties of lipid bilayers, in this study, we examined the effect of humidity and temperature on a mixture of archaeal-like lipid bilayers composed of 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DoPhPC) and 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DoPhPE) (9:1) (see Figure 1).; From the diffraction data, the q-values of Bragg peaks indicate the lattice parameter D, i.e., the distance between lipid bilayers including the water leaflet.;  This change of the lamellar lattice parameter may be attributed to an increase of the thickness of the water layer between lipid bilayers.; The lipid bilayers were studied as a multistack of hundreds of lipid bilayers on a substrate to enhance the intensity of the scattered neutrons.;  The Si wafer was positioned vertically parallel to the neutron beam so that the multistack of lipid bilayers on its surface was also parallel to the beam, and its angle, i.e., omega, was rotated from −0.5° to 12° by 0.05° step.;  If the studied structure is centrosymmetric, as it was in the case of the multistack of lipid bilayers, its Fourier transform is real, and consequently, it can only be obtained by +|Fh| or −|Fh|. To resolve the phase problem then, we used the linear correlation of the structure factors.; Several parameters of the lipid bilayer can be extracted from the NSLD [20]: the Gibbs–Luzzatti bilayer thickness (DB), the hydrophobic core thickness 2Dc, and the thickness of the water layers between the lipid bilayers Dw.;  Although archaeal lipid bilayers with inositol headgroups have been shown to be less hydrated than conventional PC lipids [34], this study showed that archaeal-like lipids with PC and PE headgroups present a higher hydration than bacterial lipids."
"water","D014867",32155764,7084678," Furthermore, the water uptake of the lipids examined was remarkably high.;  The most studied diphytanyl lipid, 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPhPC), has proven to have a low permeability to ions and water and is highly resistant to oxidation [3,4,5]. For instance, its water permeability is about three times lower than its straight-chain homologue, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) [5,6]. Moreover, DPhPC does not present a gel-to-liquid phase transition in a broad range of temperatures (−120 °C to 120 °C), probably because the methyl branches are equally spaced along the chains [7]. The equidistant localization of the methyl chains causes trans-gauche conformers to nearly be energetically equivalent, and hence gel-to-liquid transitions should be low-enthalpy processes.;  A change in the headgroup modifies electrostatic energies, water incorporation, and the gel-to-liquid transition temperature [12]. For example, since the choline head group possesses methyl groups, it does not allow close oxygen and nitrogen contacts, contrary to the ammonium group that forms strong electrostatic and hydrogen bonds between oxygen and nitrogen [13]. Consequently, PE lipids are stiffer than phosphocholine (PC) lipids, as demonstrated in diphytanoyl lipids [11]. Furthermore, the distinct headgroups modulate the bending modulus of the lipid bilayer inducing particular curvatures [14,15]. For example, while DPhPC is the only diphytanoyl lipid that produces stable lipid multilayers in oriented samples, DPhPE’s negative curvature is so important that the lipid alone self-assembles under non-lamellar phases, such as cubic and hexagonal phases [16]. Nevertheless, lipid mixtures containing DPhPC and up to 50% of DPhPE form unilamellar vesicles [13]. ; From the diffraction data, the q-values of Bragg peaks indicate the lattice parameter D, i.e., the distance between lipid bilayers including the water leaflet.;  Interestingly, it seems that hydration between 90% RH and 98% RH changes the hydrocarbon conformation of the region from 10 Å to the bilayer midplane, although this region is highly impermeable to water molecules [22]. The global variation from 90% to 100% RH is related to the interactions existing within the lamellar phase and is difficult to disentangle.;  The peak-to-peak distance from the NSLD indicates the Gibbs–Luzzati bilayer thickness (DB), 2Dc corresponds to the thickness of the bilayer hydrophobic region, Dw to the thickness of the water layer between lipid bilayer, and nw to the number of water molecules.;  The DoPhPC:DoPhPE mixture at 100% RH presented the following values: D = 50.4 ± 0.1 Å; DB = 37.4 ± 0.2 Å; 2Dc = 31.4 ± 0.6 Å and Dw = 13.0 ± 0.3 Å. The values obtained are in the order of the values obtained for DPhPC, for which DB was determined as 38 Å [17] and 35.4 Å [4] and 2Dc as 27.2 Å [4] and 27.8 Å [23]. Once the lamellar phases were exclusively present, i.e., above 90% RH, the values were nearly unchanged, and the fluctuations of the lattice parameters were mainly due to a slightly thicker water layer at higher humidity levels.;  Interestingly, the uptake of the number of water molecules (16.2 ± 0.2) is much higher than in usual bacterial straight lipids (6.5 for DPPC [24]), and also slightly higher than in ester branched lipids (14.5 for DPhPC [25]), which was probably due to the presence of DoPhPE in the system.;  The values obtained for Dw and nw changed only slightly with the RH level; however, both consistently pointed towards a continuous increase of the water layer.;  This change of the lamellar lattice parameter may be attributed to an increase of the thickness of the water layer between lipid bilayers.;  Each sample diffractogram was calibrated with a measure made with water and subtracted from the signal of the empty BerILL chamber to obtain a better signal/noise ratio.; Several parameters of the lipid bilayer can be extracted from the NSLD [20]: the Gibbs–Luzzatti bilayer thickness (DB), the hydrophobic core thickness 2Dc, and the thickness of the water layers between the lipid bilayers Dw.;  Finally, the water layer thickness was defined as Dw=D−DB, and nw defined the number of water molecules.;  Nevertheless, we detected a modest increase of water thickness due to the temperature increase.;  It would be interesting to determine the temperature dependence of other membrane parameter values—such as permeability to protons and water, rigidity and viscosity—which have not been tested here, but are of utmost importance for cell functions."

It holds promise in reducing energy consumption in wastewater treatment, which costs 3% of electricity in US annually [4]. Research into exoelectrogens has blossomed in the past decade with the discovery of >50 microbial species, such as Shewanella oneidensis and Geobacter sulfurreducens, which possess inherent bioelectricity generation capabilities [5–7]. In MFCs employing such species, organic substrates are oxidized in the anaerobic chambers and liberated electrons are transferred to extracellular electrodes through a variety of charge transfer mechanisms, such as membrane associated cytochromes, secretion of soluble redox mediators and physical appendages such as conductive pili [8–11]. Unfortunately, most of these exoelectrogens are only functional under neutral pH and low salt (<3.3%) conditions.;  This constitutes a bottleneck for MFCs to be employed in processing wastewater with high salt and/or highly alkaline conditions [12,13].; Previously, we isolated a salt- and alkaline-tolerant bacterium, Anditalea andensis ANESC-ST, from extremely soda saline-alkali soil[14]. This strain is able to grow in alkaline conditions (between pH 7.0–11.0) and under high salt concentrations (up to 4 wt% NaCl).;  Further, it belongs to the phylum ‘Bacteroidetes’, of which most members are important heterotrophs for recycling organic carbon in freshwater and marine habitats [15]. In this study, two-chamber MFCs (Fig 1 and S1 Fig) were utilized to demonstrate the bioelectricity generation capabilities of this species under high salt and/or highly alkaline conditions.;  After sterilization and decanting off the ultrapure water, the anode and cathode chambers were each filled with the respective sterile medium with the required pH and salt concentrations.; Next, the viability of A. andensis ANESC-ST under various salt concentrations was examined.; Further electrical characterization using MFCs was performed to fully study the bioelectricity generation capability of this strain under different pH and salt concentrations (Fid. 4B, C).; Taken together, A. andensis ANESC-ST—based MFCs show promise for producing bioelectricity in salt and alkaline environments."

"sulfate","D013431",35384246,9325388," The pore fluid isotopic composition of sulfate exhibit evidence of intensified microbial sulfate reduction, where both δ34S and δ18O of sulfate show a sharp increase from estimated base values of 15.0‰ and 13.9‰ to 40.2‰ and 20.4‰, respectively, and a δ34S vs. δ18O slope of 0.26.;  In the Dead Sea prolonged positive net water balance facilitated primary production and algal blooms in the upper waters and intensified microbial sulfate reduction in the hypolimnion and/or at the sediment–brine interface.;  The sulfur isotope values of the H2S (δ34SH2S = −19.6 to −21.7‰) were lower than that of the dissolved SO42− (δ34SSO4 = +15.9‰), and the H2S was suggested to have formed via microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) in the hypolimnion and/or in the underlying sediment interstitial water.;  In this study, we investigate the 5017‐1‐A core sediment distribution and pore fluid concentrations, combined with pore fluid stable S, O, and C isotope ratios, lipid biomarkers, and organic C isotope compositions to reconstruct regional hydroclimate changes, microbial processes, and microbial sulfate reduction activity in the early Holocene Dead Sea.; Pore fluid sulfate was precipitated as barium sulfate (barite) using a saturated barium chloride solution.; Saline springs on the western side of the Dead Sea, which have concentrations in excess of modern‐day brine (~10 mm), may also contribute sulfate to the Dead Sea (Gavrieli et al., 2001; Torfstein et al., 2005; Weber et al., 2022).;  An additional SO42− source and enrichment mechanism for the hypolimnion is the dissolution of calcium sulfate minerals in the upper waters (i.e., at the Mt.;  This range mostly encompasses the range of sulfur isotope fractionation associated with both organoclastic sulfate reduction and sulfate reduction coupled to methane oxidation (AOM).;  During MSR, intracellular intermediate species are produced within the cytoplasmic membrane (e.g., Adenosine 5’‐phosphosulfate, sulfite—SO32−, S2+) and there is an exchange of oxygen isotopes with water before the final sulfide product is released to the surrounding aqueous anoxic environment (Rees, 1973).;  Additionally, it was shown that when the sulfate reduction rates are high (i.e., the δ18OSO4 vs. δ34SSO4 slope is low), the effect of transport such as diffusion and sedimentation is negligible on the measured slope (Fotherby et al., 2020).;  It is reasonable to assume that rates of MSR may have been high; in the Dead Sea, microbial mats from underwater emerging springs close to the western shores have large spatial heterogeneity in sulfate reduction rates, with values up to 10 nmol cm−3 day−1 (4 × 10−6 mol cm−3 year−1) detected in saline springs (Häusler et al., 2014).;  During AOM‐SR (Equation 6), the addition of HCO3− derived from methane leads to a more pronounced decrease in the δ13C of the DIC reservoir compared to oxidation of OM via organoclastic sulfate reduction.; Lipid biomarkers from sediments can be used to detect evidence of methanogenesis, the presence of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME), and syntrophic sulfate‐reducing bacteria (SRB) involved in AOM (Blumenberg et al., 2004).;  In the anoxic hypolimnion and/or its bottom sediments there was a microbial response manifested as intensified microbial sulfate reduction.;  Intensified microbial sulfate reduction in the deep Dead Sea during the early Holocene Mediterranean sapropel 1 deposition."
"water","D014867",35384246,9325388," In modern times, increased freshwater runoff to the lake surface waters resulted in stratification and dilution of the upper water column followed by microbial blooms.;  Following a significant negative lake water balance resulting in salt layer deposits at the start of the Holocene, there was a general period of positive net water balance at 9500–8300 years BP.;  Although hydrologically disconnected, both the Mediterranean Sea and the Dead Sea microbial ecosystems responded to increased freshwater runoff during the early Holocene, with the former depositing the organic‐rich sapropel 1 layer due to anoxic water column conditions.;  In the Dead Sea prolonged positive net water balance facilitated primary production and algal blooms in the upper waters and intensified microbial sulfate reduction in the hypolimnion and/or at the sediment–brine interface.; The Dead Sea is a terminal hypersaline lake (maximum water depth of ~300 m) located within a tectonically formed depression in an arid part of the Eastern Mediterranean (Figure ​(Figure1).1).;  Before human intervention its water level reflected the water balance between freshwater influx, originating mostly from Mediterranean‐derived winter rainfall within the northern and central region of its 40,000‐km2 watershed, and evaporation (Enzel et al., 2003).;  The high brine density of the Dead Sea makes it extremely susceptible to stratification following heavy rainfall‐derived freshwater runoff events.;  Generally two conditions limit primary production in the Dead Sea: (1) high salinity and (2) phosphate nutrient availability (Oren et al., 2004; Oren & Shilo, 1985), both factors, which are impacted by freshwater runoff.;  Over the past few decades, spontaneous blooms of the unicellular primary producer green alga Dunaliella parva directly followed by a dense, red‐pigmented halophilic archaea bloom have appeared twice, in the summer of 1980 and the spring of 1992, following particularly rainy winters with increased freshwater runoff that led to stratification of the Dead Sea water column and the formation of less saline surface waters (Oren, 1993; Oren et al., 1995).; Prior to 1979 overturn of the Dead Sea water column, the deep layer of the lake (hypolimnion) was anoxic and contained hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (Nissenbaum, 1975; Nissenbaum & Kaplan, 1976).;  The sulfur isotope values of the H2S (δ34SH2S = −19.6 to −21.7‰) were lower than that of the dissolved SO42− (δ34SSO4 = +15.9‰), and the H2S was suggested to have formed via microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) in the hypolimnion and/or in the underlying sediment interstitial water.; Whether modern deep‐dwelling MSR communities in the hypolimnion and/or deep sediments respond to transient periods of increased freshwater runoff is unknown, however, the sediment record may be used to shed light on whether such a connection occurred in the past.;  Core 5017‐1‐A drilled from the deep Dead Sea (water column of ~300 m) comprises layered evaporites and clastic deposits spanning around 450‐m length and provides a near‐continuous depositional record covering >200 ka (Neugebauer et al., 2014; Torfstein et al., 2015).; The 456‐meter sedimentary core 5017‐1‐A was extracted from the deepest part of the lake at 300‐m water column depth (~720 m below mean sea level) at 31°30′28.98″N, 35°28′15.60″E.;

Figure ​Figure2c)2c) as the thickness of evaporite deposits may not reflect the relative magnitude of net water balance changes.;  Layered halite sediments (lh and hh facies in Neugebauer et al., 2014) and gypsum are interpreted as being formed following negative water balance based on the assumption that decreases in lake level leading to increased salinity is the dominant factor for precipitation of these layered evaporite units.;  The laminated detrital marl and alternating aragonite and detritus facies (ld and aad facies, respectively) are assumed to have formed during times of either steady‐state balance or positive net water balance.;  The barite was then washed once with 6‐N HCl and twice with deionized water.; The vertical distribution of halite and gypsum vs. detritus‐bearing sediments together with a binary net‐water‐balance curve (Figure ​(Figure2c;2c; see methods) reflects the net‐water‐balance changes that occurred during the early Holocene.;  With the additional information provided by conservative ion concentrations from the pore fluids and fluid inclusions from primary halite (i.e., halite precipitated from the lake water column), millennial‐scale net‐water balance changes in the hypolimnion can be quantified (Levy et al., 2017).; Halite (NaCl) evaporite layers dating to the start of the Holocene deposited as a result of a sequence of lake level drops (negative water balance), which began at the end of the last glacial period (Torfstein et al., 2015).; Beginning at ~79 mblf, the presence of ld and aad type sediments suggests a general shift from a negative to a positive lake water balance.; The appearance of laminated detrital marl (ld) facies together with dilute conservative ion concentrations suggests intermittent periods of positive water balance prior to the reprecipitation of halite at ca. 8200 years ago in the Dead Sea.;  Presently, the freshwater sources to the gypsum‐supersaturated Dead Sea carry substantially lower SO42− concentrations than in the Dead Sea itself (range of 0.04 mm in Golan basaltic springs to 1.24 mm in Wadi Hasa) (Torfstein et al., 2005).;  In the modern Dead Sea, the ongoing negative water balance throughout the later part of the 20th century resulted in brine concentration and increasing degree of supersaturation with respect to gypsum (ΩCaSO4∙2H2O = 1.42 ± 0.11 during 2008) (Reznik et al., 2009).;  In the past, Dead Sea surface water dilution resulted in lowered Ca2+ concentrations, which then allowed the inflowing SO42− to accumulate in the terminal lake via a mechanism of influx and evaporation over time, thus resulting in increasing SO42− concentrations (Gavrieli et al., 2001).;  Precipitation of gypsum in the epilimnion and sinking of these mineral particles results in the transfer and enrichment of SO42− (via dissolution) in the diluted hypolimnion in the stratified water column (i.e., “sulfur pump model”; Gavrieli et al., 2001; Torfstein et al., 2005).;  An additional SO42− source and enrichment mechanism for the hypolimnion is the dissolution of calcium sulfate minerals in the upper waters (i.e., at the Mt.;  Other potential sources include SO42− enrichment occurring via in situ gypsum dissolution, in the subsurface or early Holocene water column, or reduced mineral bound S oxidation.;  These averages are only slightly higher relative to measurements of δ34SSO4 = 14.1‰ (±0.3) and δ18OSO4 = 11.4‰ (±0.3) for Dead Sea upper waters (<100 m) sampled in 2013 (Levy et al., 2019).;  Finally, there are no known natural water sources to the modern Dead Sea with such 34S‐enriched SO42− isotope composition (Torfstein et al., 2005).;  During MSR, intracellular intermediate species are produced within the cytoplasmic membrane (e.g., Adenosine 5’‐phosphosulfate, sulfite—SO32−, S2+) and there is an exchange of oxygen isotopes with water before the final sulfide product is released to the surrounding aqueous anoxic environment (Rees, 1973).;

groundwater at Ein Gedi along the Dead Sea coast (black diamonds) with δ34SSO4,0 = 15.9‰ and δ18OSO4,0= 13.7‰ (Avrahamov et al., 2014); Eastern Mediterranean site NA‐80 methane cold‐seeps (plus signs) with δ34SSO4,0 = 20.3‰ and δ18OSO4,0 = 8.6‰ (Antler et al., 2015); Lake Kinneret stratified water column (open diamonds; LK4 expedition 10/2012) with δ34SSO4,0 = 12.6‰ and δ18OSO4,0 = 11.3‰ (Knossow et al., 2015); Yarqon estuary (gray squares) with δ34SSO4,0 = 21.1‰ and δ18OSO4,0 = 9.5‰ (Antler et al., 2013); and East Anglian salt marshes (black triangles) with δ34SSO4,0= 34.3‰ and δ18OSO4,0 = 16.1‰ (Antler et al., 2019).;  Primary gypsum deposits dating ca. 61–14.5 ka from the last glacial Dead Sea (Lake Lisan) captured the isotopic composition of lake water SO42− with relatively minor isotopic fractionation during precipitation.;  These deposits have 34S‐ and 18O‐enriched stable isotope signatures (δ34SCaSO4∙2H2O and δ18OCaSO4∙2H2O) suggesting that MSR occurred over extended period of time in the last glacial Dead Sea water column (Torfstein et al., 2005, 2008; Torfstein & Turchyn, 2017).;  On a multi‐millennial timescale, Lake Lisan was characterized by ongoing and increasing lake levels (i.e., positive net water balance), which reached a high stand around 31–17.4 ka (~Last Glacial Maximum; Torfstein et al., 2013).;  Primary gypsum layers from the Lisan Fm. have steeper δ34SSO4 vs. δ18OSO4 slopes than all the modern regional sites (~1.1 to 2; Figure ​Figure4)4) and were suggested to have recorded a very slow net MSR rate in the stratified (paleo) water column.;  It may also be comparable to modern hypersaline groundwater around the shores of the western Dead Sea banks (Avrahamov et al., 2014).;  It is reasonable to assume that rates of MSR may have been high; in the Dead Sea, microbial mats from underwater emerging springs close to the western shores have large spatial heterogeneity in sulfate reduction rates, with values up to 10 nmol cm−3 day−1 (4 × 10−6 mol cm−3 year−1) detected in saline springs (Häusler et al., 2014).; Evidence for AOM‐SR has been previously found in hypersaline groundwater from the western margin of the Dead Sea (Avrahamov et al., 2014) but, as of yet, not in the hypolimnion environment.;  Thus, a mass balance calculation that calculates the δ13C of OM oxidized within the peak δ13CDIC depth interval based on discrete measurements is used (see methods; Equation 5), providing a δ13COM value of −47‰. This estimate is lower than the range of primary derived OM in the Dead Sea (Figure ​(Figure5)5) and closer to that of CH4 (−40‰) found in the Dead Sea hypersaline groundwater along the western margins (Avrahamov et al., 2014).;  These organisms classically dominate in the Dead Sea modern and ancient waters (Bodaker et al., 2010; Thomas & Ariztegui, 2019), and sediments (Grice et al., 1998; Thomas et al., 2015, Thomas, Grossi, et al., 2019).;  In the modern Dead Sea, there is a low OM influx from the water column to the sediment (low benthic oxygen uptake of 0.46 mmol m−2 day−1), a result of the general lack of primary production and low input of terrestrial organic carbon to the lake (Häusler et al., 2014).;  However, in the sediment interval of interest (S17 and S18), the presence of n‐C17 alkane points to an additional contribution from cyanobacteria (Sachse et al., 2006) or phytoplankton to the bulk OM, that appears together with evidence of increased freshwater influx and intensified MSR.; Intensified MSR and changes in lipid biomarker distribution were coeval with positive net water balance in the Dead Sea, ultimately resulting from wet regional hydroclimate conditions.;  Illustrating the control of global climate on the net water balance of the terminal Dead Sea, similar trends are found in the deep Dead Sea composition as shown by decreasing (positive water balance) and increasing (negative water balance) conservative Mg2+ concentrations from pore fluids from 5017‐1‐A (Figure ​(Figure6b;6b; Levy et al., 2017).; The Dead Sea received most of its freshwater runoff from the Jordan River via the northern catchment during the early Holocene (Palchan et al., 2019).;  In both the Mediterranean Sea and the Dead Sea freshwater‐derived and less saline buoyant surface water layers formed.;  Increased freshwater influx to the Mediterranean Sea predominantly from the River Nile and derived from African monsoon rainfall, led to the formation of organic‐rich sapropel layer S1, spanning from 10,500 to 6100 years BP (Grant et al., 2016).;  Stratification in parts of the Mediterranean Sea resulted in eutrophication, oxygen‐poor lower water, and benthic azoic conditions, which culminated in the deposition of the sulfide and Corganic rich, sapropel layer 1 (S1) (e.g., Almogi‐Labin et al., 2009; Rohling et al., 2015).;  In the epilimnion of the stratified Dead Sea primary productivity occurred as evident by the presence of n‐C17 alkane, while in the deep Dead Sea (hypolimnion) intensified MSR occurred at/below the sediment‐water interface (Figure ​(Figure6f).6f).;  Collectively, the marine and lacustrine evidence suggest that the microbial ecology in both the surface and deep Mediterranean Sea and Dead Sea were independently responding to the increased influx of freshwater during the early Holocene.; The present study provides insight into the microbial response in the Dead Sea to positive net water balance caused by enhanced regional hydroclimate activity between ca. 9500–8300 years BP.;  Positive lake net water balance was accompanied by depositional changes and surface water dilution, which facilitated enhanced microbial processes in both the surface and deep Dead Sea.;  Analogous to modern‐day spontaneous blooms of the primary producer Dunaliella parva and halophilic archaea following increased freshwater runoff, lipid biomarkers archived from the deep sediments suggest the onset of upper water column productivity following positive lake net water balance."

"agar","D000362",19411423,2704845," The cellulose-supported media have several advantages over agar- and gellan gum-derived media, including versatility and stability.; Solidified media using agar as a solidifying agent are indispensable in microbiology.;  For solid cultures of mesophilic microorganisms, agar is an ideal solidifying agent and has been used essentially unchanged since it was first introduced in the late 19th century (2, 15).;  For example, agar media are not suitable for culturing thermophiles and hyperthermophiles because the solidification of agar is thermoreversible at around 50 to 60°C (21), and the media are unstable at temperatures much above 70°C for extended periods (1).; Cellulose, agar, and gellan gum (often referred to by the trade name Gelrite) plates containing Luria-Bertani (LB) broth, nutrient broth (NB), or soybean casein digest (SCD) broth at three different pH values (2, 7, and 12) were prepared.;  The stability of agar and gellan gum plates depended strongly on the type of medium, temperature, and pH.;  Only LB-agar and SCD-agar plates at pH 7 remained solid at 70°C.;  To develop agar- or gellan gum-supported media for these conditions, the medium formulations, such as agar concentration, had to be modified empirically to ensure solidification (14).;  Conventional agar plates and/or gellan gum plates containing the same nutrients were used for control experiments.; Growth of extremophiles on media solidified with cellulose, agar, and gellan guma; Hydrolysis of agar in acidic media and the toxicity of hydrolysates prevented growth of A. acidophilum on the agar-solidified medium (10, 12).;  In the case of alkaliphilic B. clarkii, no difference was observed in the number of colonies formed on the cellulose and agar plates.; G. stearothermophilus grew as well on nutrient cellulose at pH 6.8 and 55°C as it did on nutrient agar.;  At this temperature, agar and gellan gum media do not remain solid (4).;  Colony formation was also confirmed at 65°C with cellulose, whereas culture on the agar plate met with sporadic success due to syneresis.;  The cellulose-supported media have several advantages over conventional solidified media using agar or gellan gum (9, 14) for culture of extremophiles, including versatility, stability, and ease of preparation.;  However, solidifying such media with agar or gellan gum for use under extreme culture conditions is difficult."

"lipid A","D008050",33255932,7759928," In particular, the LPS’ glycolipid moiety, the lipid A, typically undergoes several structural modifications comprising desaturation of the acyl chains, reduction in their length and increase in their branching.;  The investigation of the structure of the lipid A from cold-adapted bacteria is, therefore, crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying the cold adaptation phenomenon.;  Here we describe the structural elucidation of the highly heterogenous lipid A from three psychrophiles isolated from Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica.;  All the lipid A structures have been determined by merging data that was attained from the compositional analysis with information from a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and MS2 investigation.;  As lipid A is also involved in a structure-dependent elicitation of innate immune response in mammals, the structural characterization of lipid A from such extremophile bacteria is also of great interest from the perspective of drug synthesis and development inspired by natural sources.; LPSs display a tripartite structural architecture comprising: (i) a highly variable polysaccharide (the O-chain or O-antigen) covalently linked to (ii) an oligosaccharide moiety (the core OS), in turn linked to (iii) the glycolipid part (the lipid A) embedded in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane [5]. With the above three moieties, the LPS is defined as smooth-type LPS (or S-LPS), when lacking the O-chain is designated as rough-type LPS (or R-LPS) [5]. Importantly, LPS is widely known to interact with the mammalian innate immune system, with the lipid A moiety specifically recognized by the host innate immunity receptorial complex TLR4/MD-2 [7]. As a consequence of this interaction and depending on the lipid A fine structure, LPS differently activates the production of host pro-inflammatory cytokines, some causing excessive activation of the TLR4/MD-2 signaling, others exhibiting a weak or no immunopotency.;  This event can be beneficial to the host, enhancing resistance to infecting microbes, however massive and uncontrolled pro-inflammatory cytokines release can eventually lead to septic shock and multi-organ failure [7]. In this scenario, the search for novel lipid A structures which might possess modulatory activity towards TLR4/MD-2 dependent signaling cascade is considered of high relevance.; From these significant structural and functional perspectives, we here report about the structural characterization of the lipid A from three different psychrophilic bacteria isolated from Terra Nova Bay, Antartica: Pseudoalteromonas tetraodonis strain SY174; Psychromonas arctica strain SY204b, and Psychrobacter cryohalolentis strain SY185.; All the lipid A structures have been determined by merging information that was attained from the compositional analysis executed on pure LPS with information from a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) investigation executed on the isolated lipid A fractions and directly on bacterial pellets.;  Finally, an in-depth MS2 analysis has been conducted in order to detailly establish the location of the acyl chains with respect to the glucosamine disaccharide backbone of each isolated lipid A fraction.;  This information was key in supporting the following elucidation of the lipid A structures by MALDI-TOF MS and MS2 approaches.; Fatty acid content of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from the three cold-adapted bacteria examined in the current study. “+” and “-” indicate the presence and absence of the fatty acid in the lipid A, respectively.;  All the strains are characterized by a disaccharide of D-glucosamine as the lipid A sugar backbone.; In order to investigate the structure of the lipid A portion, an aliquot of each LPS underwent a mild acid hydrolysis, typically performed to selectively cleave the acid labile glycosidic linkage between the core OS and the lipid A moiety.;  Once the lipid A of each strain was obtained, an aliquot was analyzed to define the nature of the lipid A sugar backbone (i.e., a D-glucosamine disaccharide for all the strains), whereas another aliquot underwent a detailed MALDI-TOF MS and MS2 investigation to finally establish the fine structure of the lipid As.;  This approach was essential to confirm the structures deduced by analyzing the isolated lipid A fractions, and to exclude any loss of structural data possibly occurring as a consequence of the chemical treatment used to isolated the lipid A (i.e., the mild acid hydrolysis of the LPS).; The negative-ion reflectron MALDI-TOF MS spectrum of the lipid A from P. arctica is reported in Figure 1.;  The main ion peaks and the proposed interpretations of the fatty acids composing the lipid A are reported in Table 2.;  The spectrum three clusters of signals corresponding to mono- and bis-phosphorylated tetra- to hexa-acylated lipid A species showed in the range of m/z 1303.8–1822.1, highlighting a heterogenous lipid A blend.;  Indeed, besides the occurrence of minor peaks differing for 28 amu (i.e., a -CH2CH2- unit) representing variation in the acyl chains length, peaks differing for 2 amu were also identified, likely indicating the presence of lipid A species also bearing unsaturated acyl moieties, as also shown by compositional analysis (Table 1).;  Briefly, the main peak at m/z 1794.1 matched with a bis-phosphorylated lipid A species carrying 14:0 (3-OH) as primary fatty acids, and 12:0 and 14:1 as secondary acyl substituents, the corresponding mono-phosphorylated lipid A species was at m/z 1714.1.;  Similarly, mono- and bis-phosphorylated penta-acylated lipid A species lacking one primary 14:0 (3-OH) matched with peaks at m/z 1488.0 and 1568.0, respectively (Figure 1, Table 2), whereas a penta-acylated form devoid of the 12:0 acyl chain was detected at m/z 1612.0.;  The bis-phosphorylated tetra-acylated lipid A species, devoid of one primary 14:0 (3-OH) and the secondary 12:0, was assigned to peak at m/z 1385.9; the related mono-phosphorylated form was assigned to peak at m/z 1305.9.; Reflectron MALDI-TOF mass spectrum, recorded in negative polarity, of lipid A from P. arctica strain SY204b obtained after acetate buffer treatment.;  The lipid A species are labelled as Tetra, Penta and Hexa Lip A indicating the degree of acylation. “P” indicates the phosphate group.; The main ion peaks observed in the MALDI-TOF MS spectra reported in Figures 1, 3 and 5, the predicted mass and the proposed interpretation of the substituting fatty acids and phosphates on the lipid A backbone.;  The observed masses reported in the table are compared to the calculated molecular weight (predicted mass, Da) of each ion based on the proposed lipid A structures.;  The MS2 spectrum of the precursor ion at m/z 1794.1 (Figure 2a), corresponding to a bis-phosphorylated lipid A species carrying four 14:0 (3-OH), one 12:0 and one 14:1, showed an intense peak at m/z 1550.01 which was attributed to an ion originating from the loss of a 14:0 (3-OH) unit.;  The negative-ion MS2 spectrum of the precursor ion at m/z 1712.0, chosen as a reference of a mono-phosphorylated hexa-acylated lipid A species, is reported in Figure 2b.;  The MS2 spectrum, besides furnishing crucial information about the position of the secondary acyl substituents, also provided additional and unreported structural information about P. arctica lipid A.;  In detail, three intense peaks were detected at m/z 1467.94, 1485.90 and 1513.90 and were assigned as follows: the peak at m/z 1467.94 was attributed to an ion derived from the loss of a primary 14:0 (3-OH); the ion at m/z 1485.90 matched with a lipid A fragment originated from the loss of the secondary 14:1 fatty acid, whereas the peak at m/z 1513.90 was ascribed to an ion derived from the loss of a secondary 12:1 acyl moiety.;  The occurrence of two unsaturated fatty acids was in agreement with the mass difference of 2 amu with the respect to the species occurring at m/z 1714.1, i.e., the mono-phosphorylated form of the main lipid A species detected at m/z 1794.1.;  Therefore, P. arctica exhibited a more heterogeneous lipid A than previously reported [6], being composed of species also concomitantly decorated by two unsaturated secondary acyl chains, distributed in a 4 + 2 symmetry with the respect to the glucosamine disaccharide backbone.; MALDI-TOF MS2 analysis of hexa-acylated lipid A species from P. arctica strain SY204b. (a) Negative-ion MALDI MS2 spectrum of precursor ion at m/z 1794.1, a representative ion peak of the cluster ascribed to hexa-acylated lipid A species decorated by two phosphates. (b) Negative-ion MALDI MS2 spectrum of precursor ion at m/z 1712.0, a representative ion peak of the cluster ascribed to hexa-acylated lipid A species decorated by one phosphate.;  The proposed structure for the lipid A species is reported in each inset.; The MALDI-TOF MS spectrum, recorded in negative polarity, of the lipid A isolated from P. cryohalolentis LPS is reported in Figure 3, whereas the spectrum recorded on intact bacteria is reported in Figure S3.;  The high heterogeneity of the lipid A was clearly visible in both spectra, which were similar and showed in the m/z range 1571.7–1697.9 a main, complex pattern of peaks relative to hexa-acylated lipid A species which differed in the nature of the fatty acids.;  This family of peaks, with the main representative at m/z 1627.7, matched with a bis-phosphorylated lipid A species carrying four primary 12:0 (3-OH), and one 12:0 and one 10:0 as secondary acyl moieties (Table 2).;  A less intense cluster of peaks at around m/z 1781.8 was ascribed to a hepta-acylated lipid A species carrying, in the case of the species at m/z 1781.8, an additional 10:0 unit (Figure 3 and Figure S3, Table 2).; Reflectron MALDI-TOF mass spectrum, recorded in negative polarity, of lipid A from P. cryohalolentis strain SY185 obtained after acetate buffer treatment.;  The lipid A species are labelled as Tetra, Penta, Hexa and Hepta Lip A indicating the degree of acylation.; The negative-ion MS2 spectrum of precursor ion at m/z 1547.7 (Figure 4), corresponding to a mono-phosphorylated hexa-acylated lipid A species, confirmed the location of the secondary acyl chains with respect to the glucosamine backbone, that is only on the non-reducing glucosamine unit, as previously reported [9]. This structural hypothesis was corroborated by the observation in the MS2 spectrum of an important ion derived from the sugar ring fragmentation 0,4A2 [8] which clearly indicates the location of the 10:0 and the 12:0 moieties on the non-reducing glucosamine.;  However, the observation of an intense peak at m/z 1347.70 matching with an ion originating from the loss of the 12:0 unit, suggested that a minor lipid A species might exist with the inverted location of the secondary acyl chains (i.e., 12:0 in an acyloxyacyl ester moiety and 10:0 in an acyloxyacyl amide moiety).; Negative-ion MALDI-TOF MS2 spectrum of precursor ion at m/z 1547.7, main ion peak of the cluster ascribed to hexa-acylated lipid A species decorated by one phosphate.;  The proposed structure for the lipid A species is reported in the inset.; Therefore, as reported [9], P. cryohalolentis strain SY185 mainly expresses a highly heterogenous bis-phosphorylated hexa-acylated lipid A species whose primary fatty acids range from 11 to 14 carbon atoms in length, whereas as the secondary acyl chains 10:0, 12:0, 12:1, 14:0, and 15:0 have been found (Table 1).; The negative-ion MALDI-TOF mass spectrum executed on P. tetraodonis lipid A is shown in Figure 5.;  The well-known heterogeneity of the lipid A was immediately evident, as previously reported by our group for the lipid A structure from other Pseudoaltermonas species [10,11], and in full accordance with compositional analysis.;  As observed for P. arctica, peaks differing by 2 amu were also observed and were attributed to the presence of lipid A, also decorated by unsaturated acyl chains, in agreement with compositional analysis data and with previous reported data [10,11]. Mono- and bis-phosphorylated penta-acylated lipid A species were detected in the mass range m/z 1337.6 –1501.6, with the main species at m/z 1445.6 that matched with a bis-phosphorylated penta-acylated lipid A carrying two 12:0 (3-OH) and two 10:0 (3-OH) as primary fatty acids, and one 14:0 as secondary acyl substituent (Figure 5, Table 2).;  As observed for the other bacteria analyzed in the present work, the negative-ion MALDI-TOF MS spectrum recorded on the P. tetraodonis strain SY174 cell pellet was similar to the one recorded on the isolated lipid A, and is reported in Figure S4.; Reflectron MALDI-TOF mass spectrum, recorded in negative polarity, of lipid A from P. tetraodonis strain SY174 obtained after acetate buffer treatment.;  The lipid A species are labelled as Tetra and Penta Lip A indicating the degree of acylation.;  However, in order to unequivocally establish the location of the secondary acyl substitution, an aliquot of lipid A, underwent a treatment with NH4OH, which selectively removes the acyl and acyloxyacyl esters, leaving the acyl and acyloxyacyl amides unaffected [12]. The negative-ion MALDI-TOF MS spectrum, reported in Figure 7, showed a main peak at m/z 1105.4 matching with a bis-phosphorylated lipid A carrying the solely primary N-linked 12:0 (3-OH) chains with the secondary 14:0 moiety linked to the primary 12:0 (3-OH) of the non-reducing glucosamine unit (Figure 7), thus definitively confirming the location of the secondary acyl substitution in P. tetraodonis lipid A.; Negative-ion MALDI-TOF MS2 spectrum of precursor ion at m/z 1445.6, main ion peak of the cluster ascribed to penta-acylated lipid A species decorated by two phosphates from P. tetraodonis strain SY174.;  The proposed structure for the lipid A species is reported in the inset.; Reflectron MALDI-TOF mass spectrum, recorded in negative polarity, of lipid A from P. tetraodonis strain SY174 after treatment with NH4OH.;  Therefore, most bacteria modify their membrane lipids to maintain a certain degree of membrane fluidity [14]. Psychrophilic Gram-negative bacteria in this sense greatly modify the structure of the main component of their outer membrane, the LPS molecule, to increment the outer membrane fluidity, thus allowing protein movement, and hence function [6]. Here we reported on the lipid A structures of the LPS from three psychrophilic bacteria isolated from Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica; our analyses provided additional structural information about such an important structural component of the Gram-negative outer membrane component.; As reviewed elsewhere [6], the lipid A from a P. arctica strain isolated in the Svalbard islands in the Arctic Ocean was consistent with a blend of species ranging from penta- to hepta-acylated, with a predominant hexa-acylated form composed of the typical bis-phosphorylated diglucosamine skeleton bearing four 14:0 (3-OH), one 14:0 and one cyclopropyl-tetradecanoic acid unit.;  Here we also found a lipid A structure containing 14:0 (3-OH), as the primary acyl chains, whereas some differences were observed in the nature of the secondary acyl moieties.;  Additionally, neither cyclopropyl-tetradecanoic acids nor hepta-acylated lipid A species [6,9] have been detected in the current study.;  The discovery of a higher degree of unsaturation found for the lipid A of this P. arctica strain isolated from the Antarctica environment is an important structural characteristic which confirms the tendency of cold-adapted bacteria to increment the outer membrane fluidity by modifying and desaturating their membrane lipids, decreasing the lipid packing and thus increasing the membrane fluidity.; As for P. cryohalolentis, previous studies on P. cryohalolentis K5 (ATCC BAA-1226) strain showed that this bacterium was able to synthesize at least seven major lipid A forms based on a high degree of acyl chains flexibility with a dominant hexa-acylated cluster, and minor clusters of the penta- and hepta-acylated forms [9]. Accordingly, we found a major hexa-acylated lipid A species with the main representative species, detected at m/z 1627.7 (Figure 3), corresponding to a bis-phosphorylated lipid A carrying four 12:0 (3-OH) and one 12:0 and one 10:0 secondary fatty acids in a 4 + 2 symmetry with the respect to the disaccharide backbone.;  Notably, the P. cryohalolentis K5 (ATCC BAA-1226) lipid A structure with a decreasing temperature showed a near-elimination of odd-numbered acyl chains and a shift toward shorter acyl moieties, a structural trend to favor bacterial membrane fluidity [15]. Here the observation in the spectrum (Figure 3) of the occurrence of lesser but significant MALDI-TOF peaks that differ by a single-methylene group flanking the most abundant peak at m/z 1627.7 demonstrated that this P. cryohalolentis strain tends to maintain a certain degree of odd-numbered acyl chains.;  On the other hand, a shortening of the acyl chains’ moieties with respect to the most abundant lipid A species was observed, as proven by the occurrence of the peaks in the m/z range 1571.6–1613.7.;  Finally, it is worth underlining that, in accordance with the tendency of cold-adapted bacteria to increase the desaturation of their membrane lipids, here we found that this Antarctic strain of P. cryohalolentis produces a lipid A species also carrying an unsaturated secondary fatty acid chain (12:1, Table 1) [9,16].; By contrast, no studies have been reported so far about P. tetraodonis lipid A.;  However, several papers described the structure of the lipid A from other Pseudoalteromonas species [10,11] which confirmed and strengthened our results on a heterogenous bis-phosphorylated penta-acylated lipid A species as the main form.;  Here, the main lipid A species was detected at m/z 1445.6 that matched with a bis-phosphorylated lipid A species bearing two O-linked 10:0 (3-OH) and two N-linked 12:0 (3-OH) as the primary fatty acids, whereas 14:0 was identified as the secondary acyl substituent.;  This structural assessment further proved the high heterogeneity of the lipid A species that characterizes Pseudoalteromonas sp.;  LPS because the same peak (at about m/z 1445.6) was previously observed for other Pseudoaltermonas sp. but a different structure was deduced [11]. Importantly, given the controversial data reported in the literature about the exact location of the secondary acyl moiety in the lipid A from Pseudoalteromonas species, here we showed that P. tetraodonis lipid A is characterized by the occurrence of the secondary fatty acid exclusively on the N-linked primary acyl chain of the non-reducing glucosamine.; It is worth underlining that all of the lipid A structural peculiarities discussed above, especially the occurrence of unsaturated and short acyl chains, are surely of great scientific interest from an evolutionary point of view, improving the comprehension of the molecular mechanisms allowing low temperature adaptation phenomena.;  This scenario becomes even more fascinating under the biological/immunological point of view considering that the TLR4/MD-2-mediated immunoactivity of an LPS is strictly related to the lipid A structure.;  Actually, hypoacylated lipid As (namely lipid A species expressing less than six acyl chains) usually only scantly activate the TLR4-MD-2-mediated immune response [6,7]. Moreover, a 4 + 2 symmetry of the acyl chains with respect to the glucosamine backbone, as in the case of E. coli LPS, has been correlated to a more potent immunostimulatory activity, whereas a 3 + 3 symmetry has been related to a reduction in the immunopotency of the whole LPS molecule [6,7]. In this context, previous studies have demonstrated that, despite expressing a bis-phosphorylated hexa-acylated lipid A with a 4 + 2 symmetry, P. cryohalolentis LPS exhibits a lower immunostimulatory capacity than E. coli LPS [16]; this was attributed to the shorter primary and secondary acyl chains (10–12 carbon atoms) compared with E. coli lipid A (12–14), which might not provide an equally efficient LPS activation of the TLR4/MD-2 mediated signaling.;  Similarly, several LPS from Pseudoalteromonas strains have been investigated for their immunological properties, revealing a very weak immunostimulant activity in accordance with the hypo-acylated nature of their lipid A; however, this LPS exhibited an interesting inhibitory capacity towards the toxic effects of the E. coli LPS [17]. The observation that, depending on the structure of the lipid A, LPSs isolated from psychrophilic bacteria are able to modulate the host immune response, in addition to the unlimited sources from which it is possible to isolate such microorganisms, represents an incentive for an in-depth investigation of cold-adapted Gram-negatives as a potential never-ending basin of natural immunomodulatory molecules.;  Therefore, a detailed study of the immunological properties of the particular LPS/lipid A here defined would be essential to improve the current knowledge about the role of the exact location and nature of the fatty acids in the LPS structure-immunoactivity relationship.;  Briefly, the 3-hydroxy fatty acids were released after treatment with 4 M NaOH (100 °C, 5 h), converted into the 3-methoxy acid L-phenylethylamides, and then analyzed by GC-MS [20]. The comparison of the retention times of authentic L-phenylethylamides of various standard fatty acids with those derived from the examined LPSs allowed the assignment of the (R) configuration to all of the fatty acids composing the lipid A from the three psychrophilic bacteria.; An aliquot of each purified LPS was treated with acetate buffer (pH 4.4, 2 h, 100 °C) in order to separate the lipid A portion from the saccharide part of the LPS.;  The chloroform phase, containing the lipid A, was collected and washed with the water phase of a freshly prepared Bligh/Dyer mixture (CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O, 2:2:1.8) [21]. The organic phases were pooled, dried, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (SCIEX, Concord, ON, Canada).;  In order to establish the nature of the sugar backbone of each lipid A, an aliquot of each lipid A fraction also underwent a methanolysis (1.25 M HCl/CH3OH, 80 °C, 16 h) followed by acetylation (80 °C, 20 min) and GC-MS analysis [22].; In the present paper we reported on the structural characterization of the LPS lipid A from three taxonomically different psycrophilic Gram-negative bacteria isolated from Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica.;  All the three cold-adapted bacteria, P. tetraodonis strain SY174, P. arctica strain SY204b, and P. cryohalolentis strain SY185 displayed structural features in their lipid As, likely supporting and favoring their ability to live and proliferate in Antarctica, the coldest continent on Earth.;  Among others, a high level of heterogeneity, both in the acylation and in the phosphorylation degree, has been observed for all the analyzed lipid As.;  In addition, in accordance with the tendency of psychrophiles to increase the desaturation of their membrane lipids, unsaturated fatty acids were detected as structural constituents of all the three lipid As.;  In particular, P. arctica strain SY204b showed an even more heterogenous lipid A than previously reported [6], being characterized by the occurrence of species also concomitantly carrying two unsaturated acyl moieties.;  Finally, the structure of the lipid A from P. tetraodonis strain SY174 has been here described for the first time, and confirmed the high heterogeneity of the tetra- and penta-acylated lipid A species found in other Pseudoalteromonas species [10,11]. This study further supports and strengthens data describing the existence of lipid A modification systems that are often regulated by environmental conditions [27], and underlines the capability of extremophile bacteria to modify their outer membrane lipid components to deal with the detrimental stressors of the surrounding environment."

 Comparative metagenomics of the 212 metagenomes representing freshwater, alkaline, and saline ecosystem microbiome indicated the selective enrichment of the microbial groups and genetic features.; Sambhar Lake is the largest inland, hypersaline lake (salt content ∼30 g/L), situated at the semi-arid Aravalli schists of Rajasthan (longitude 75°05′E, latitude 26°58′N), India.;  Thus, the hypersaline environment provides a unique opportunity to study the functional attributes of the microbes present in such a harsh environment (Oren, 2010).;  Metagenomic exploration of the freshwater, alkaline, and saline water ecosystem has identified unique inhabitants and their unique genetic machinery (Poli et al., 2017).;  The current study will enrich our understanding of the microbiome evolution in the hypersaline environment.; The hypersaline lake water samples were collected at the depth of 1 m from the five different locations of the salt lake, Sambhar, Rajasthan (longitude 75°05′E, latitude 26°58′N) in sterile containers in April 2015 (temperature 38°C).; Metagenomic datasets from freshwater, saline water, and alkaline water microbiome were compared to check their similarity and uniqueness at phylogenetic and metabolic levels.;  A total of 212 metagenomic datasets representing freshwater (131), saline water (67), and alkaline water (14) ecosystems (Supplementary Table 2) were extracted from the MG-RAST server to identify rRNA and protein features (Meyer et al., 2008).; Sambhar Salt Lake is a unique temperate hypersaline ecosystem where inhabiting microbes successfully survive in harsh conditions (Upasani, 2008; Bhatt et al., 2016; Sangeeta et al., 2016).;  Microbial communities in harsh ecosystems harbor a plethora of information to elucidate their physiological functions to enrich our understanding of ecosystem functioning in hypersaline temperate ecosystems (Naghoni et al., 2017).;  A higher percentage of these protein features might be extending physiological flexibility to the salt lake microbes to thrive in the hypersaline environment.;  These metabolic features either independently or synchronously might be allowing the salt lake microbes to thrive in saline conditions (Figure 1).;  Hereby, to survive and adapt to the hypersaline conditions, the microbes should equip themselves with oxidative stress response machinery (Ma et al., 2020).;  Metagenomic analysis of the Sambhar hypersaline lake microbiome has identified a 39.7% of the total stress response protein features whose homologs have been characterized for maintaining reduction–oxidation balance within microbial cells (Table 2).;  The presence of these features indicated microbial survival strategies to overcome environmental stresses of the hypersaline environment.; Overview of osmotic stress tolerance mechanisms prevalent within Sambhar hypersaline lake microbiome.; Comparative metagenomics of diverse metagenomes representing the saline, freshwater, and alkaline ecosystems identified uniqueness and similarities at the taxonomy and microbiome physiological functions level.;  PCA of the diverse metagenomes based on taxonomic features (phylum and class level of taxonomic hierarchy) (Figures 2A,B), as well as metabolic features annotated with the Subsystem database (hierarchy level L1 and L2) (Figures 3A,B), indicated the differential clustering of the freshwater, alkaline water, and saline water metagenomes (Figures 2A,B).;

 Phylogenetic affiliation of the rRNA features at the phylum level of taxonomic classification and their PERMANOVA analysis indicated that saline microbiome composition was significantly different from freshwater (p = 0.0003), as well as from the alkaline environment (p = 0.0024) (Supplementary Table 10).;  The plot showed an abundance (>70%) of Thermotogae, Planctomyces, and Spirochetes among the alkaline ecosystem, while Euryarchaeota, Eustigmatophyceae, and Cyanobacteria were abundant in the saline ecosystem (Figure 4A).;  Ternary plots with phylogenetically affiliated rRNA features at the class level of taxonomic hierarchy indicated that Thermotogae, Planctomycetia, Spirochetes, and Trebouxiophyceae were abundant (>70%) in the alkaline metagenomes, while Halobacteria, Fusobacteria, Coscinodiscophyceae, and Deltaproteobacteria showed an abundance within the saline ecosystem.;  Identified saline ecosystems-specific microbes represented similar microbial groups identified with rRNA feature and protein feature-based phylogenetic characterization of Sambhar Salt Lake microbiome.; Phylogenetic affiliation of the protein features at the class level of taxonomic classification and their PERMANOVA analysis indicated that microbiome composition of all studied ecosystems (saline, freshwater, and alkaline environment) was significantly different (p = 0.0003) from each other (Supplementary Table 12).;

 Comparative analysis shows metabolic features associated with the protection from osmotic stress, oxidative stress, antibiotic, and metal/metalloid toxicity among saline, freshwater, and alkaline ecosystems indicating the significantly diverse abundance (p < 0.05) of these metabolic features in these ecosystems (B).; Sambhar Lake is one of the largest semi-arid, temperate, and hypersaline inland ecosystems, making it a hostile environment for the growth of any life form (Yadav and Sarin, 2009).;  Hypersaline, semi-arid environment is a unique ecosystem, possibly very few around the globe (Brauner et al., 2013).;  The biotechnological and physiological potential associated with the hypersaline microbiome has attracted the attention of researchers around the globe (Enache et al., 2017).;  The presence of the halophilic microorganisms in saline environments is well expected and similar phylotypes were recorded from various other saline environments (Naghoni et al., 2017).;  Additionally, comparative metagenomics indicates Halobacteria as the signature microbial group of the saline ecosystems.;  The presence of these features in almost all microbial clades of the lake microbiome describes osmotic adaptability as an imperative parameter for successful survival in the hypersaline environment (Sorokin and Kuenen, 2005).;  Comparative metagenomics also decoded significant enrichment of osmotic stress tolerance protein features in the saline ecosystem (Figure 6B).;  As the acquisition of salt-tolerant mechanisms is essential for survival in these hostile environments (Ahmed et al., 2018), the saline ecosystem microbiomes might have enriched themselves with these features as a survival strategy.; Although the identified adaptive physiology is essential to survive in this hypersaline environment, are these adaptive physiology-associated protein features specific to the saline ecosystem? or invariably present in all aqueous microbiomes? It could only be assessed through comparative metagenome analysis of saline, alkaline, and freshwater ecosystem microbiomes.;  The results indicated a differential abundance of stress (oxidative and osmotic) response and energy harvesting features to the saline ecosystem microbiome, while several other features were associated with other ecosystem microbiomes (Figure 6 and Supplementary Table 15)."

Extreme halophilic Euryarchaeota seem to be always the dominant group in salt-saturated hypersaline brines, both those with neutral or alkaline pH [1, 7, 37]. Here, we found that although these haloarchaea are still relatively more abundant in the sediments exposed to brines with salt-saturating conditions, the clear majority of microbes in all investigated hypersaline soda lake sediments are Bacteria.;  General features and exact location of the sampled soda lakes are summarized in Additional file 1: Table S1; a map of the area was published previously [5]. Cock Soda Lake (a stand-alone lake, sampled both in 2010 and 2011) and Tanatar-3 (Tanatar system) were moderately hypersaline (~ 100 g L−1) with sandy sediment, while Tanatar-1 and Bitter-1 (Bitter system) were salt-saturated (400 g L−1) with sulfide-rich sapropel sediments underlined by rock trona deposits [7, 60].

From these, only a limited number of genomes have been sequenced today, mostly from chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the genus Thioalkalivibrio (class Gammaproteobacteria) [1, 11, 12]. It is well established that metagenomics enables the recovery of genomes and the identification of novel genetic diversity where culturing efforts fail [13, 14]. In recent years, next-generation sequencing has recovered a massive number of genomes from previously unknown groups of prokaryotes [15, 16], including a strikingly large and diverse group called “Candidate Phyla Radiation” (CPR), only distantly related to other cultured bacterial lineages [17]. Previously, we conducted a metagenomics study on soda lakes and reconstructed novel genomes from uncultured Bacteroidetes and “Candidatus Nanohaloarchaeaota” living in hypersaline Siberian soda brines [7]. Here, we turned our attention to the far more complex prokaryotic communities living in the sediments of the hypersaline soda lakes from the same region.;  In the sediment of Bitter-1, also a purple sulfur bacterium from the same family was highly abundant.;  The potential of the Thioalkalivibrio spp. for chemolithotrophic sulfur oxidation was evident (Additional file 7; see Additional file 8: Information S1).;  Like other members of this genus, it had the potential to reduce or disproportionate partially reduced sulfur compounds.;  It might detoxify sulfide by oxidizing it to elemental sulfur (sqr) with subsequent reduction or disproportionation of the polysulfides (psrA) chemically formed from the sulfur.;  The MAGs encoded for a versatile metabolism typical for purple non-sulfur bacteria.;  Since the sqr gene was present, but no dsr or sox genes, the organism might oxidize sulfide only to elemental sulfur.;  While an isolated strain of Dethiobacter alkaliphilus is a facultative autotroph that respires thiosulfate, elemental sulfur or polysulfides with hydrogen as an electron donor [42] or disproportionates sulfur [43], other haloalkaliphilic members of the Syntrophomonadaceae are reverse acetogens, oxidizing acetate in syntrophy with a hydrogenotrophic partner [44]. Two populations (different species, Additional file 6) were especially abundant in Cock Soda Lake (Fig. 4).;  These uncovered the presence of most of the functional groups participating in carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and minor element cycling at haloalkaline conditions.;  Third, even within the sulfur cycle, the most active and frequently studied element cycle in soda lakes [1], we found considerable metabolic novelty.;  The soda lakes examined in this study were also eutrophic, and sulfur compounds were abundant.;  Besides the evident high metabolic and taxonomic diversity of dissimilatory sulfur-cycling bacteria, a diverse heterotrophic community can be sustained comprising both generalist and very specialized carbon degraders."

protein sequences from databases, often derived from genomic and metagenomic
analysis, has been shown to be a powerful methodology that has been successfully
applied to identify extremophilic xylanases in GH11 family [12] and for discovery of hidden
properties of carbohydrate active enzymes [13], [14], [15].; In this communication we describe an in
silico analysis of GH10 family, searching for xylanases with
extreme thermophilic and alkalophilic properties, and the functional and
structural characterization of the enzyme with best characteristics.
Additionally, we show that the modification of the protein structure by the
addition of carbohydrate binding domains improves the enzyme performance, which
is relevant for biotechnological applications.;  Fusion of a carbohydrate binding module

"hydrogen","D006859",34093984,8148631," Xyn11 structure, which has been solved at
1.8 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography, reveals an unusually high number of
hydrophobic, ionic and hydrogen bond atomic interactions that could account for
the enzyme’s extremophilic nature.;  Intraprotein hydrophobic and ionic
interactions, hydrogen bonds, aromatic and cation-π interactions were
determined by PIC server (Protein Interactions Calculator) [32]. The accessible surfaced
area (ASA) and the exposed charged accessible area were both calculated with
VADAR server [33]. The
formula for compactness was: ASA/number of total residues, and for % exposed
charged accessible surface area was: exposed charged accessible area /ASA
*100.;  Apart from this hydrophobic wall, subsite
−2 is well-characterized by the presence of a great amount of hydrogen bonds
at the opposite wall with a number of very conserved residues.;  Thus, and
according to the complex model, O2 for the xylose would interact with Trp301
and Glu50, O3 with Glu50 and Asn51, O4 would be stabilized by Trp301 and
Lys54, which also form a hydrogen bond with O5.; The xylose bound at subsite + 1 is mainly fixed by stacking
to Tyr189 and hydrophobic interaction to Trp309 and Phe313, all conserved
residues, and lacking direct polar interactions as in other xylanases.
However, in Xyn11, the presence of the pair Phe313-Phe314 narrow the cavity
at this subsite + 1 and, more important, fixes the conformation of the
Arg260 side-chain in a very restrained position pointing to the inner part
of the cavity, in which it could be hydrogen linked to O2 and O3 of xylose
bound at subsite + 2.;  Number

an increase in rigidity in the core of the protein [62] and is considered one of the major
contributors to extreme-stability, especially when considering the main

[64]. Again, Xyn11
presents a high number of hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions.;  A relevant hydrogen bond is
represented as dashed line. (For interpretation of the references to color in

"salt","D012492",19930649,2785825," This review focuses on the correlation between the extent of alkaline pH and elevated temperature optima and the extent of salt tolerance of extremely halophilic eubacteria; the focus is on those with alkaline pH optima, above 8.5, and elevated temperature optima, above 50°C.; It is frequently asked: what are the physical and chemical boundaries for life? How extreme can conditions become and still support life? In respect to one extreme--haline conditions--the answer is simple; growth has been observed at saturated concentrations of sodium salts, mainly NaCl.;  But what happens if one tries to increase the solubility of these salts by increasing the temperature? This overview deals with the diversity of bacteria able to grow under concomitant extreme growth conditions, namely high sodium salt concentration, alkaline pH and elevated temperature, and thus with the recently isolated anaerobic halophilic poly-extremophiles.;  These microorganisms are defined as extreme halophiles, in contrast to those microorganisms which merely tolerate such sodium concentrations or which grow optimally at marine salt concentrations of approximately 3.5% w/v (Table ​(Table1).1).;  These bacteria have been isolated from various extreme environments such as solar thalassohaline salterns (i.e., originating from marine waters) [4], athalassohaline (e.g., Wadi An Natrun, Egypt) [2] and ancient thalassohaline (e.g., Great Salt Lake, UT, USA) [5] salt lakes, marine environments [6], and fermented fish sauces [7]. Additionally, among the validly published taxa (i.e., published in, or publication validated by, the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology), the extremely halophilic Bacteria are relatively equally distributed between aerobic and anaerobic species, with the addition of four facultative anaerobes, such as Halomonas sinaiensis [8] and Thiohalorhabdus denitrificans [9]. Examples of extremely halophilic bacteria--representing different types of extrema--include Halorhodospira halochloris (basonym Ectothiorhodospira) [10], which, at 4.62 M, has one of the highest [Na+] optima [11]; Halomonas taeanensis, which is capable of growing over the unusually wide range of 0-5.13 M Na+ [12]; and Natranaerobius 'grantii', which tolerates saturated NaCl concentrations in its growth medium at elevated temperature and alkaline pH [13].;  In other words: is the extent of one extreme condition limiting the concomitant extent of other extreme growth condition (e.g., a higher temperature optimum requiring a less alkaline pH or a lower sodium salt concentration)?; Interestingly, out of all the established extremely halophilic bacteria, only nineteen species have pH optima of 8.5 or greater [see Additional File 1], although many salt lakes and salterns from which these organisms were isolated have alkaline pH values.;  Three of the four anaerobic extremely halophilic alkalithermophiles, N. thermophilus, N trueperi and N. wadinatrunensis, were isolated from the solar-heated, alkaline, hypersaline lakes of the Wadi An Natrun, Egypt (temperatures up to 60°C measured in the salt brine) [2,24]. The Wadi An Natrun is a series of eight lakes in northern Egypt noted for their salinity and alkaline pH.;  Although nearly every month novel halophiles are published in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology the majority of them are Archaea, or grow only at slightly elevated salt concentration, and are not bacterial extreme halophiles."
"NaCl","D012965",19930649,2785825,"Bacterial microorganisms that grow optimally at Na+ concentrations of 1.7 M, or the equivalent of 10% (w/v) NaCl, and greater are considered to be extreme halophiles.; It is frequently asked: what are the physical and chemical boundaries for life? How extreme can conditions become and still support life? In respect to one extreme--haline conditions--the answer is simple; growth has been observed at saturated concentrations of sodium salts, mainly NaCl.; Different authors use different definitions for what constitutes a halophile; one definition identifies microorganisms which grow optimally at Na+ concentrations greater than 0.2 M as halophiles [1]. For this review, the authors wish to focus upon bacterial microorganisms that grow at the upper limits of the combined extremes, and in the case of halophiles, optimally at Na+ concentrations of 1.7 M, or the equivalent of 10% NaCl.;  In this review Na+ concentrations are given in mol/liter, rather than % NaCl, since some of the alkaliphilic halophiles require media with carbonates, usually provided as sodium carbonates, for pH control [2,3]. Therefore the [Na+] comes both from the sodium carbonates and from the supplemented NaCl.;  These bacteria have been isolated from various extreme environments such as solar thalassohaline salterns (i.e., originating from marine waters) [4], athalassohaline (e.g., Wadi An Natrun, Egypt) [2] and ancient thalassohaline (e.g., Great Salt Lake, UT, USA) [5] salt lakes, marine environments [6], and fermented fish sauces [7].

Clearly, as the [Na+] increases the number of known microorganisms with the adaptive mechanisms that enable them to thrive under these conditions decreases."

"saline","D012965",35587636,9241684," The research showed that endophytic bacteria of P. euphratica in an extremely saline environment had low species diversity, especially in sap tissue.;  Notably, Firmicutes (relative abundance >5%) was a different dominant phylum in the samples from the high-saline environment compared with the relatively low-saline-environment group.;  The linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis found that there were significant differences in different saline environments of Cytophagaceae (family), Rhodobacteraceae (family), and Rhodobacterales (order).;  In this study, by analyzing the endophytic bacteria of P. euphratica in different saline-alkali regions of Xinjiang, it was found that the bacteria in different tissues of P. euphratica changed with the change of soil salinity.;  Data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) indicates that greater than 424 million hectares of topsoil (0 to 30 cm) and 833 million hectares of subsoil (30 to 100 cm) are salt affected: 85% of salt-damaged topsoils are saline, 10% are sodic, and 5% are saline-sodic, while 62% of salt-affected subsoils are saline, 24% are sodic, and 14% are saline-sodic (1).;  These data also show that 20% to 50% of irrigated soils on all continents are too saline; this means that more than 1.5 billion people in the world are facing major challenges in food production due to soil degradation.; In the past 30 years, the main research on plants in saline-alkali land has focused on the resistance of plants to salt stress.; Therefore, this study analyzed the endophytic bacteria of P. euphratica on different saline-alkali soils in Xinjiang, observed whether the endophytic bacterium was stable or changed with the increase of the salt-alkali concentration, and clarified whether the endogenous bacteria of P. euphratica were related only to its own saline-alkali environment or would alter with variations in the external environment.;  Therefore, we grouped ZP_9, ZP_8, DBC_9, and DBC_8 into S_saline, H_saline, M_saline, and L_saline.;  There was no way to use P. euphratica grown in nonsaline soil as a control.; In order to understand the endophytic microbial community of P. euphratica in different saline environments, we analyzed the alpha diversity index of each sample by MiSeq high-throughput sequencing, including the read numbers, coverage, Shannon index, and Chao index of each sample at a genetic distance of 3% (Table 2).;  Similar results were also found in saline samples from the Arava Valley, of which the microbial diversity was limited because of the extreme habitats (15).;  The relative abundances of the Firmicutes in the four groups under various salinities were quite different, 9.04% and 15.37% in the extreme saline group and the very robust saline group (Fig. 2B and ​andC)C) and 2.79% and 3.26% in the robust saline group and the moderate saline group (Fig. 2D and ​andE).E).;  From the higher abundance of Firmicutes, it can be inferred that the high-saline environment will affect the composition of the endophytic microbiota of P. euphratica, and the Firmicutes with high stress resistance can survive to a greater degree in a high-pH and high-salt environment, so that P. euphratica can survive better under these conditions, too.;  Not only that, a strain of Bacillus with strong saline and alkali tolerance was screened from the LB selective medium with high salinity and alkalinity which can survive under the extreme conditions of 10% NaCl and pH 11.;  Therefore, we speculated that the Firmicutes containing Bacillus were of great significance for the endophytes of P. euphratica and the host’s resistance to a saline-alkali environment.;  The comparative abundances of this phylum in the extreme saline group and very strong saline group were 1.14% and 2.99%, respectively (Fig. 2B and ​andC),C), while those in the robust saline group and the moderate saline group were 1.25% and 5.45%, respectively (Fig. 2D and ​andE).E).;  Moreover, its relative abundance was the highest in the sap and xylem of the moderate saline group of P. euphratica, reaching 7.15% and 5.32%, respectively (Fig. 2A).;  The high abundance of Deinococcus-Thermus in the tissues of P. euphratica in semiarid areas with moderate salinity indicated that this phylum was drought tolerant but not saline tolerant.;  Strains have been isolated not only from some extreme environments, such as soda lakes (25), saline and alkaline soils (26), a hypersaline lake (27), Antarctic soil (28), desert soil (29), and so on, but also from human beings (30).;  In order to adapt to the high-saline-alkali environment, P. euphratica removes the excess salt absorbed in the soil into white crystals on the trunk or branches to maintain its own osmotic balance.;  Zhang et al. treated cotton seeds with rhizosphere salt-tolerant growth-promoting bacteria including Bacillus and Halomonas, which were isolated from Kalidium foliatum, and effectively improved the growth of cotton under saline-alkali stress (36).;  In previous studies, most Rhodobacterales originate from marine habitats but some originate from (hyper-)saline lakes or soil (39).; LEfSe analysis of microbial abundance of samples under different salinities. (A) Cladogram of microbial communities. (B) LDA score identified the size of differentiation between saline and mild saline with a threshold value of 4.; For example, 3-oxoadipate CoA-transferase can oxidize 3-oxoadipate to 3-oxoadipate-CoA and then through acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase and 3-oxoadipyl-CoA thiolase to generate succinyl-CoA, which participates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and provides significant energy for bacteria and plants to resist saline stress.;  These enzymes highly expressed in a saline environment play a very important role in the resistance of endophytes and plants to salt stress.;  It can be seen that under high pH and in a high-salt environment, Bacillus haynesii P19 took more time to adapt to the saline-alkali environment during the adaptation period, and when it reached the plateau period, the growth density of the bacteria was only slightly lower than that in the normal environment.; In this study, we report the endogenous bacterial community structure of P. euphratica in different saline environments.; We compared the differences of microorganisms in different salinities; alpha diversity showed that the endogenous bacterial diversity of P. euphratica in different saline environments and different tissues was varied; in particular, the Shannon index and Chao index of the sap of P. euphratica under extreme salinity were lower than those in other groups.;  The high-abundance Deinococcus-Thermus under moderate salinity were drought tolerant but not saline tolerant.;  At the genus level, the dominant genera of sap of P. euphratica under extreme salinity were very different from those of other groups, almost all of which were related to saline-alkali tolerance.; The saline-alkali-tolerant strain Bacillus haynesii P19 screened from the tissue of P. euphratica can still grow well under the conditions of 60 g/L NaCl and pH 10.;  We found that different saline environments will affect the composition of the endogenous flora of P. euphratica.;  However, due to the limitation of conditions, it was impossible to determine which specific metabolic pathways and physiological systems were regulated by the predicted microbial functions alone in a saline-alkali environment.; We collected four samples of P. euphratica xylem, three samples of P. euphratica sap, and two samples of rhizosphere soil from a P. euphratica forest (high-saline soil) in Zephyr, Xinjiang, China (E76°57.935′, N38°01.848′), and collected four samples of P. euphratica xylem, three samples of P. euphratica sap, and two rhizosphere soil samples as controls from a P. euphratica forest (mild saline soil) in Darbancheng, Xinjiang, China (E87°91.531′, N43°52.026′)."

"salt","D012492",35052375,8774410," Moreover, the yeast functional complementation test proved that some CrNHXs could partially restore the salt tolerance of the salt-sensitive yeast mutant AXT3.;  This study provides comprehensive bio-information and primary functional identification of NHXs in C. rosea, which could help improve the salt/alkaline tolerance of genetically modified plants for further studies.;  It has been estimated that nearly 10% of the total land surface (950 Mha) and about 50% of all irrigated land (230 Mha) are salt-affected, therefore drastically reducing agricultural productivity and altering the geographical distribution of crops [1,2]. Salinity primarily causes ionic stress and osmotic stress in plants.;  The resulting salinity-induced water stress, oxidative stress, nutritional imbalances, ion toxicity, and disruption of metabolic processes restrict the normal growth of plants [3,4]. During the process of evolution, plants have developed multiple mechanisms involving genes and strategies at the physiological, molecular, and metabolic levels to improve salt resistance in various ways.;  To cope with salt stress, plants have evolved three distinct responses, including osmotic stress tolerance, sodium ion (Na+) or chloride ion (Cl−) exclusion, and the accumulation of Na+ or Cl− in the tissues [5]. Therefore, it is suggested that some membrane proteins, including transporters or channels, play critical roles in maintaining ion homeostasis and osmotic adjustment, and regulating pH for plant survival under abiotic stress, such as high salinity/alkaline and drought.;  The Na+/H+ exchangers (NHXs), belonging to the subfamily of monovalent cation-proton antiporters (CPA), are H+-coupled cotransporters that transfer Na+, potassium ion (K+), or lithium ion (Li+) across membranes in exchange for hydrogen ions (H+), playing significant roles in cellular ion homeostasis, pH regulation, and plant salt tolerance [6].;  Based on the subcellular localization, the AtNHX protein family could be categorized into three subclasses: vacuolar (AtNHX1–AtNHX4), endosomal (AtNHX5 and AtNHX6), and plasma membrane (AtNHX7/SOS1 and AtNHX8) [7,8]. Among them, the distinctive plasma membrane AtNHX7/SOS1 (SOS1A) is the key factor of the well-known salt tolerance salt-overly-sensitive (SOS) pathway.; Numerous reports have confirmed the involvement of NHX proteins in salinity stress responses [8]. Based on the released genome sequences of various plant species, genome-wide analyses of NHX families have recently gained remarkable traction in investigations of plant salt and alkaline tolerance mechanisms.;  Research on NHX genes in halophytes, xerophytes, or even extremophiles would improve the understanding of the adaptation of plants to environmental stress and provide a good foundation for formulating effective measures to modify the tolerance of crops to external stresses [17,18,19]. In recent years, the functional identification of NHX families from different plant species has broadly indicated that the NHX families are crucial for ion homeostasis, cellular pH regulation, plant development, vesicle trafficking, and salt-tolerance in plants.;  Mechanically speaking, the NHX transporters present in plant membrane systems maintain ionic homeostasis via the extrusion of Na+/K+ ions out of the cells or the compartmentalization of Na+/K+ ions into the vacuoles [14,15,16,20,21]. The NHX families have been systematically studied in rice [22], mulberry [23], poplar [24,25], alfalfa [26], sugar beet [27], grapevine [28], wheat [29], rapeseed [30], soybean [31], maize [32], bamboo [33], and cotton [34,35,36,37]. All of the above investigations established a substantial foundation for further functional studies of plant NHX genes and provided a systematic understanding of NHX families in regulating the salt tolerance of crops or plant species with specialized habitats.;  In addition, using effective gene resources to cultivate salt-, alkali-, and drought-resistant plant species is the most economical and productive measure to solve this problem.;  For some crops, genetic engineering strategies provide a viable alternative to conventional plant breeding and are now becoming more widely used throughout the world to produce salt-tolerant cultivars.;  Halophytes can thrive under high salinity by adopting special strategies to improve salt tolerance or enhance salt avoidance [38]. Canavalia rosea is a halophyte species and widely distributes in tropical and subtropical coastal regions or islands [39]. As we have sequenced the whole genome of C. rosea, a functional study of its gene/protein family could provide a reference for researching the conservation biology of plant species in specialized habitats.;  This study will provide significant insights into the function of plant NHXs as well as identify promising candidate genes for breeding salt-resistant crops.;  These results suggest that, under the extreme circumstances on the tropical coral reef, the expression of CrNHXs in C. rosea leaves was most likely suppressed to some degree, implying the decreased transporting of salt ions in the aerial part of this halophyte to alleviate the toxic effects of high salinity/alkaline.;  In the root, after 2 h of salt stress, CrNHX5 and CrNHX7 were obviously induced (by 33.71 and 136.83%), while the expression of CrNHX4 was downregulated (by −42.95%); high alkaline stress only induced CrNHX7 expression (by 35.21%) and decreased the expression of CrNHX3-1 (by −48.98%), CrNHX4 (by −90.09%), and CrNHX4-1 (by −57.71%) in the root at the 2 h time point, while high osmotic stress also greatly decreased the expression of CrNHX3-1 (by −39.85%) and CrNHX4 (by −60.95%) at 2 h in root (Figure 7A).;  In contrast, high salt stress for 2 h caused the decreased expression of CrNHX5 (by −39.24%) and CrNHX7 (by –32.48%) in the leaf samples, as well as the high alkaline challenge (by −43.02% and −40.13%, respectively); the high osmotic stress also obviously decreased the expression of CrNHX5 (by −43.30%) in C. rosea leaf at the 2 h time point (Figure 7B).;  In the root, after 48 h of salt change, only CrNHX5 showed obviously upregulated expression patterns (by 62.59%), while the high alkaline and osmotic stresses caused irregular transcriptional changes (Figure 7C).;  The expression of CrNHX3-1 was decreased by high salt stress (by −72.03%), while the expression of CrNHX7 was slightly induced by high alkaline and osmotic stresses (by 54.26 and 16.23%) (Figure 7D).;  The results of the qRT-PCR analysis showed that seven CrNHXs responded to different stresses to varying degrees, and similarly, the expression of CrNHXs under salt stress was more greatly regulated in both the root and leaf samples, and the alkali stress also resulted in variable expression patterns of several CrNHX members, such as CrNHX1 and CrNHX4.;  In brief, after 2 h challenges, the expression of CrNHX1 was obviously induced by high salinity, alkaline, and high osmotic stress both in root (by 689.86, 187.53 and 118.38%) and in leaf (by 317.30, 494.99 and 120.95%), while the expression of CrNHX4 was only induced in leaf by salt, alkaline, and high osmotic stresses, till 541.22, 588.62 and 695.85%, respectively.;  After 48 h challenges, the expression of CrNHX1 was greatly induced by salt and alkaline in root, and the expression levels reached to almost 17 and 18-fold changes (by 1574.74 and 1661.48% increasing), while in leaf tissue, the expression of CrNHX1, CrNHX3-1, CrNHX4, and CrNHX4-1 was all decreased greatly in different levels, while the high salinity and osmotic stresses strongly induced the expression of CrNHX5 (by 155.31 and 79.36%), as well as the expression of CrNHX6 (by 194.91 and 73.11%).; The different levels of salt tolerance generated by specific CrNHX members (CrNHX1, CrNHX3, CrNHX5, CrNHX6, and CrNHX7) are demonstrated in Figure 10.;  These results confirmed the functions of CrNHX1, CrNHX3, CrNHX5, CrNHX6, and CrNHX7 in salt tolerance and also proved the biochemical functions of CrNHX members in transmembrane transport in a single-cell system.;  Our findings also demonstrate that the CrNHX members showed different functional specificities for salt tolerance in yeast cells, though their biological functions in plants need to be further explored.;  To tolerate salt stress, plants have developed a series of physiological, biochemical, and ecological strategies.;  Halophytes are likely to possess some morphological, physiological, or molecular mechanisms associated with development and growth regulation that have evolved as adaptive responses to salt tolerance [38]. In general, halophytes can adjust osmotically to the surrounding high salinity by accumulating ions and sequestering them into the vacuoles or out of the cytoplasm to maintain cellular water or solute homeostasis and to prevent adverse effects on metabolism [51]. It is well documented that NHX proteins are involved in salinity tolerance by mediating Na+ transport, K+ homeostasis, pH regulation, and cellular vesicle trafficking, thereby regulating the ion balance in plants under salt stress [52].;  Some members identified from other plant species have been well characterized and are proved to be associated with salt tolerance in plants, mainly including NHX7/SOS1 genes in Arabidopsis [10], soybean [53], rice [54], cotton [55], and wheat [56]. Vac-NHX or Endo-NHX can form convenient channels for vacuolar or endomembrane system Na+/K+ sequestration, while PM-NHX is mainly responsible for the Na+/K+ efflux out of the cell in exchange for H+ influx into the cell [52,57]. Besides several Arabidopsis Vac-NHX or Endo-NHX members [12,13,14,15,16], some other Vac-NHX or Endo-NHX genes have been confirmed to be involved in the compartmentalization of Na+/K+ into the vacuoles or intracellular compartmentalization and are critical of salt tolerance in other plant species [48,58,59]. In recent years, the functional identification of NHX genes from plant species growing in specialized habitats has been explored, including in eremophytes and halophytes [60,61,62,63]. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which NHX family members are involved in salt tolerance and stress regulation will be of great significance for elucidating the environmental adaptation mechanisms of plants in specialized habitats.;  The ABRE, MYC-, MYB-, and TC-rich repeat elements are believed to be involved in plant responses to dehydration, low temperature, salt stress, and other abiotic stresses.;  Canavalia rosea is a typical salt and drought-tolerant sea-drifting plant that is significant for ecological reconstruction on tropical reefs and islands.; Given the extreme salt/alkaline, drought, and heat environment on YX Island, we mimicked the main stress factors to detect the expression patterns of CrNHXs, including high salinity, alkaline, high osmosis, and heat stress.; Although plenty of previous reports have confirmed that overexpressing NHXs in plants could result in the elevated salt tolerance of the whole plant, probably by maintaining the balance of Na+/K+ and controlling saline ions and pH homeostasis in cytoplasm [33,34,37,48,53,54,55,56], the expression of CrNHXs in C. rosea was not always induced by the high salinity/alkaline challenges.;  In this study, CrNHX1, CrNHX3, CrNHX5, CrNHX6, and CrNHX7 were cloned and expressed in the salt-sensitive yeast mutant strain AXT3.;  These five CrNHXs could partially restore the Na+/K+ tolerance of AXT3 (Figure 10A,B), while the recovery from salt resistance showed some member-specific variance.;  In contrast to MnNHXs in mulberry [48], two Vac-type CrNHXs, CrNHX1 and CrNHX3, showed greatly enhanced tolerance to salt-stress (Na+/K+ tolerance) compared to the two Endo-type CrNHXs (CrNHX5 and CrNHX6) and PM-type CrNHX7, and the hygromycin B tolerance seemed to be similar (Figure 10C).;  Further detailed analysis of expression profiles for CrNHXs performed using RNA-seq data, as well as using the heterologous expression assays with the yeast system to investigate the transporting activities of several CrNHXs, proved that this family is involved in salt/alkaline stress responses and plays vital roles in ecological adaptability for natural extreme adversity on tropical coral islands and reefs.;  The results in this study offer a foundation for future work aimed at both elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying NHXs functioning in salt resistance and high salinity/alkaline environmental adaptation mechanisms from the starting point concerning plant NHX genes."

The lipopeptides surfactin, fengycin/plipastatin, and bacillibactin are synthesized non-ribosomally and have been previously detected in B. subtilis [37]. Surfactin is a lipoheptapeptide with antimicrobial, antiviral, and anti-mycoplasma activity.;  Surfactin contributes to inducing systemic resistance against plant pathogens [38], and fengycin can act directly against pathogenic fungi by destabilizing their membrane integrity, although its role in stimulating the ISR response in plants cannot be excluded [8].;  The genome of B. halotolerans KKD1 contains the gene clusters for the non-ribosomal synthesis of surfactin (NRPS), fengycin/plipastatin (NRPS), bacillibactin (NRPS), and bacilysin (other).;  The expression of surfactin and fengycin in KKD1 was experimentally validated by HPLC and MALDI-TOF-MS.;  The molecular masses of the ions at m/z 1030.59 corresponded to C13 surfactin A [M + Na]+, at m/z 1074.60 to C16 surfactin A [M + Na]+, at m/z 1030.59 to C13 surfactin A[M + Na]+, at m/z 1486.71 to C16 fengycin A [M + Na]+, and at m/z 1501.69 to C14 fengycin B [M + K]+.; MALDI-TOF-MS and HPLC analysis of lipopeptide in B. halotolerans KKD1.

A wide range of sugars were identified in smaller amounts, with uronic acids also present but only making up a small proportion (4.3%) of the total monomer composition.; The carbohydrate fraction of the EPS was mannose rich, and previous studies suggest that mannose-rich biopolymers are directly involved in sequestering calcium species (31)."

"salt","D012492",32833498,7116095,"We present the hypothesis that microorganisms can change the freezing/melting curve of cold salty solutions by protein expression, as it is known that proteins can affect the liquid-to-ice transition, an ability that could be of ecological advantage for organisms on Earth and on Mars.;  JG3, and analyzing its response in culture conditions that included specific hygroscopic salts relevant to Mars—that is, highly concentrated magnesium perchlorate solutions of 20 wt % and 50 wt % Mg(ClO4)2 at both end members of the eutectic concentration (44 wt %)—and subfreezing temperatures (263 K and 253 K).;  However, the question remains as to whether our novel hypothesis that halophilic/psychrophilic bacteria or archaea can alter the freezing/melting curve of salt solutions could be validated.;  The null result obtained after analyzing just one case lays the foundation to continue the search for proteins produced by microorganisms that thrive in very cold, high-saline solutions, which would involve testing different microorganisms with different salt components.; The presence of liquid water on Mars has been linked to a decrease in the freezing point of aqueous solutions by variable enrichment in dissolved salts such that high ionic solutions and brines would be prevalent on a “cool and wet” Mars (Fairén, 2010, 2020), a hypothesis that has found recent support in the identification of highly saline intervals in the Gale crater lakes (Rapin et al., 2019; Thomas et al., 2019).;  Perchlorate salts are of particular relevance to Mars.;  The discovery of perchlorates on Mars (Hecht et al., 2009; Glavin et al., 2013; Sutter et al., 2017) has significant astrobiological implications because (1) they are chaotropic salts, (2) they are highly hygroscopic, (3) in aqueous systems they have eutectics at subzero temperature, and (4) they can serve as electron acceptors for a number of microorganisms under anoxic conditions.;  Therefore, numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the stability of perchlorate salt solutions, which have been proposed to exist as metastable supersaturated solutions over a wide range of relative humidity (RH) and temperature conditions relevant to Mars (Zorzano et al., 2009; Davila et al., 2010; Gough et al., 2011; Martín-Torres et al., 2015; Ojha et al., 2015).; The foundation of the hypothesis presented in this article is the precise testing of whether the molecules (mainly proteins) derived from the adaptations of microorganisms to cold salty conditions can influence their own environment.;  Replicated measurements of the sterile solution at 50 wt % Mg(ClO4)2 settled the end of melting, when neither ice crystals nor remains of hydrated salts were present, at 311 K.;  Overall, the survivability of bacteria when confronting the two stress conditions tested together (high concentrated salts and subfreezing temperatures) was noticeably low (around 2% in general, and in no case over 4%), and therefore, it would be more accurate to refer to the “tolerance” of a reduced number of cells to the stress conditions.;  Microscopy imagery revealed that the size and shape of E. coli seemed to be slightly modified after the exposure to the cold and salty stress conditions.;  Further experiments specifically focused on that potential relationship will be required for future work, as will better controls with regard to the metastability of the salt.;  It is likely that the gap observed is due to the perchlorate and high solute concentration, and the contribution of cells likely remains low in our experiments and may be shielded by the effect of the salt.;  Presumably, the concentration of cells, and thus the potential molecules and components affecting the solution, is noticeably lower compared with the salt concentration.;  JG3 at 263 K in 20 wt % of magnesium perchlorate (Fig. 3) constitutes a first insight into the proteomic analysis of the responses of this bacterium to cold and salty (particularly perchlorates) conditions.; Broadening these proteomic studies could inform with regard to the responsible contributors of the interaction between the cells and the perchlorate system and other proteins that are differentially expressed and involved in cell functions in the cold salty conditions, such as some members of the Csp family that also play a role in osmotic stress (Phadarte, 2004; Schmid et al., 2009).; The study of the combined cold and salty conditions bears an extra relevance, beyond the understanding of the central role of IBPs, because relatively often the molecules synthetized by bacteria to cope with both conditions are the same, as is the case, for example, of the synthesis of trehalose and other compatible osmotic solutes (De Maayer et al., 2014; Cray et al., 2015).; The limits of growth in perchlorate for Rhodococcus remain unknown, but several studies of other halotolerant microorganisms indicate tolerance and growth at concentrations up to 20% in a nonperchlorate salt (NaCl).;  Growth is reduced (around 2%) in the case of magnesium perchlorate, but it increases if both salts are combined in the medium (Matsubara et al., 2017).;  These morphological changes of bacteria and their aggregation in the perchlorate solutions have been recently described as well for Planococcus halocryophilus as a salt stress response (Heinz et al., 2019), and have also been observed in our Rhodococcus cultures in Mg(ClO4)2 (Fig. 2B).;  Several reports have shown that bacterial morphological changes are indeed caused by environmental stress conditions (Shen and Chou, 2016), which happens especially in salty media and at low temperatures for gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli (Yang et al., 2016).;  In particular, different types of bacteria tolerant to high perchlorate concentrations became larger and morphologically aberrant (Oren et al., 2014), or aggregated into long cellular chains (Beblo-Vranesevic et al., 2017), when exposed to this salt.; We hypothesize that the physical presence of bacteria capable to cope with cold and salty conditions may have an influence on cold brines, providing favorable scenarios for the formation of microniches where life would be possible.; The hypothesis presented here opens new perspectives with which to explore more deeply those mechanisms microorganisms use to adapt to stressors in microenvironments, and it will aid in our understanding whether, as a result of adaptation, microorganisms can influence extreme cold and salty environments and make them more hospitable.;  Further development in this new area of research would also require the following: (1) extending our experiments to a variety of halophilic archaea; bacteria; relevant eukaryotes (e.g., Antarctic cryptoendolithic lichens); other aerobic psychrophilic strains, in particular, in which IBPs have been recently described in detail; and anaerobic cultures where perchlorates can act as electron acceptors; (2) extending our analyses by using different salt components; (3) incorporating additional assays of the potential changes in the eutectic point of different salts influenced by the presence of microorganisms and, as a result, the changes in the adaptation of the microorganisms to salinity and at different subzero temperatures, as well as temperature cycles that may act as triggering factors for the synthesis of IBPs; (4) identifying and isolating IBPs and the search for other proteins produced by microorganisms in different salt solutions at freezing temperatures and at different concentrations in calorimetry experiments; (5) studying in detail the effect of vitrification on bacteria and on the proteins expressed by them; and (6) from these studies and along additional proteomic analyses, identifying new biomarkers to be considered for the astrobiological exploration of Mars and other planetary bodies.; We have presented here the novel question of whether microorganisms can change the freezing/melting curve of perchlorate (or any salt) solutions.;  JG3) and salt (cold Mg-perchlorate solutions) tested did not show the expected effect means that we can only report in this article a null result in testing our hypothesis, although the question remains an interesting one and deserves further examination.;  Our plans include testing halophilic archaea, bacteria, and some relevant eukaryotes (such as Antarctic cryptoendolithic lichens) by using different salt components."

"salt","D012492",35742848,9223760," However, some of the heat-upregulated CrHsp20 genes showed completely different expression patterns in response to salt, alkaline, or high osmotic stresses, which indicates their potential specific function in mediating the response of C. rosea to abiotic stresses.;  For example, a cytosolic class I small Hsp from Rosa chinensis, RcHSP17.8, could enhance the thermotolerance and resistance to salt, drought, and osmotic stresses of transgenic microorganisms and Arabidopsis [24]. Overexpression of a wheat TaHSP23.9 in Arabidopsis showed improved heat and salt tolerance in the transgenic lines [25]. The heat-induced and chloroplast-localized sHsp gene from creeping bent grass, AsHSP26.8a, displayed slightly improved tolerance to drought, but demonstrated reduced tolerance to heat and salinity stresses when overexpressed in bent grass and Arabidopsis plants [26,27]. Overexpression of a pepper CaHSP16.4 gene enhanced tolerance to heat stress in Arabidopsis [28]. These studies have clearly demonstrated that Hsp20 genes are involved in regulating a diversity of responses to abiotic stresses, especially heat stress.;  In addition, C. rosea is an extremophile halophyte, exhibiting excellent high salt/alkaline and drought tolerance [31], and is, therefore, being used as a ‘pioneering species’ for island greening, sand fixation, and ecological restoration in tropical and subtropical coral islands and coastal zones [32]. Notably, the tremendous growth potential under extreme adversity depends on the long-term adaptive evolution of these specialized habitat species, thereby generating specific GRNs and functional genes.;  The results of this study provide baseline information for the role of an important gene family in the adaptation of a leguminous species to heat, high salt/alkaline, and drought stress, and also offers a reference for gene evolution and function in response to abiotic stresses.;  In the roots, alkaline stress also affected the expression of the CrHsp20 family; however, the influence was smaller than that of salt.;  The qRT-PCR results show that compared with the salt, alkaline, and high osmotic stresses (dozens to hundreds of times), all 14 transcripts accumulated greatly after the heat stress process (hundreds to thousands, even till to tens of thousands of times) (Figure 8).; Quantitative RT-PCR detection of the expression levels of the 14 CrHsp20s (CrHsp20-4, CrHsp20-5, CrHsp20-7, CrHsp20-8, CrHsp20-9, CrHsp20-10, CrHsp20-14, CrHsp20-25, CrHsp20-26, CrHsp20-27, CrHsp20-28, CrHsp20-31, CrHsp20-35, and CrHsp20-40) responding to different stresses (600 mM NaCl for salt stress, 150 mM NaHCO3 for alkaline stress, 300 mM mannitol for high osmotic stress, or heat stress at 45 °C) in C. rosea seedling plants. (A) The expression patterns in roots under salt treatment. (B) The expression patterns in leaves under salt treatment. (C) The expression patterns in roots under alkaline treatment. (D) The expression patterns in leaves under alkaline treatment. (E) The expression patterns in roots under high osmotic stress treatment. (F) The expression patterns in leaves under high osmotic stress treatment. (G) The expression patterns in roots, stems, and leaves under heat stress.; Under salt treatment, the transcript abundance peaked at 48 h in the detected CrHsp20s, with the exception of CrHsp20-5, CrHsp20-9, and CrHsp20-10, for which it appeared to decrease at 48 h (Figure 8A,B).;  Given the intensity of sun light and environmental heat, as well as the complicated high salt/alkaline and water shortage on Yongxing Island (YX), this result further implies that CrHsp20s might act in abiotic stress responses in the native specialized habitat (YX) of C. rosea.;  For instance, the carrot Hsp17.7 gene could increase the growth rates and protein solubility in transgenic yeast under heat, cold, acid, and osmotic stress conditions [51]. Three Camellia sinensis small Hsp genes, CsHSP17.7, CsHSP18.1, and CsHSP21.8, also increased the tolerance of Pichia pastoris to heat and cold through heterologous expression in yeast [52]. Similarly, the overexpression of an Hsp (ThHSP18.3) from Tamarix hispida also conferred salt, alkaline, high osmotic stress, heavy metal, and heat or cold stress tolerance in yeast [53]. These CrHsp20s may act as molecular chaperones to protect yeast against heat stress damage by stabilizing proteins and membranes from degeneration, thereby maintaining regular yeast growth.;  For salt–alkaline stress, the cleaned C. rosea seedlings were soaked in a 150 mM NaHCO3 (pH 8.2) solution (1/2 Hoagland’s)."
"Iron","D007501",37520367,10376724,""
"sulfur","D013455",37520367,10376724," The type strain AHT1T was described as a facultative chemolithoautotrophic sulfidogen reducing or disproportionating sulfur or thiosulfate, while strain Z-1002 was isolated as a chemolithoautotrophic iron reducer.;  Key catabolic processes sustaining the growth of both D. alkaliphilus strains appeared to fit the geochemical settings of two contrasting natural alkaline environments, sulfur-enriched soda lakes and iron-enriched serpentinites.;  Genome analysis revealed multiheme c-type cytochromes to be the most probable determinants of iron and sulfur redox transformations in D. alkaliphilus.;  We propose that sulfur-enriched soda lakes could be secondary habitats for D. alkaliphilus compared to Fe-rich serpentinites, and that the ongoing evolution of Dethiobacterales could retrace the evolutionary path that may have occurred in prokaryotes at a turning point in the biosphere’s history, when the intensification of the sulfur cycle outweighed the global significance of the iron cycle.;  Despite several extreme parameters, soda lakes are characterized by high productivity and contain fully functional and diverse haloalkaliphilic microbial communities that drive the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (Jones et al., 1998; Zavarzin et al., 1999; Sorokin et al., 2011, 2014a).;  In modern soda lakes, the sulfur cycle is one of the most active biogeochemical processes.;  Redox transformations of inorganic sulfur compounds are energetically efficient enough for microorganisms to cope with costly life under polyextreme conditions.;  An important phenomenon observed in the sediments of Kulunda soda lakes (Altai region, Russia) is that sulfidogens using elemental sulfur and thiosulfate as electron acceptors are more active there than sulfate reducers despite the higher abundance of sulfates in the ecosystem (Sorokin et al., 2011).;  Inspite of the predominance of the sulfur cycle, several species and genera of iron reducers have been isolated from soda lakes and their wide distribution in these ecosystems has been further reported (Zavarzina et al., 2016).;  Importantly, most dissimilatory alkaliphilic iron reducers are capable of using sulfur as an alternative electron acceptor, just as many alkaliphilic sulfidogens have been shown to reduce Fe(III) (Zavarzina et al., 2018).; Dethiobacter alkaliphilus, the only cultured representative of the genus Dethiobacter, was isolated from mixed anaerobic sediments of northeastern Mongolian soda lakes, and was described as a sulfur- and thiosulfate-reducing, facultatively chemolithoautotrophic sulfidogen utilizing H2 and a range of organic electron donors, strain AHT1T (Sorokin et al., 2008).;  The organism is also capable of sulfur or thiosulfate disproportionation (Poser et al., 2013, 2016).;  Thus, the two cultured strains AHT1T and Z-1002 of the single species of the class “Dethiobacteria” were isolated as sulfur/thiosulfate- and iron-reducers, respectively, from the sediments of soda lakes located on two different continents.; The aim of our work was to fill the knowledge gap on the metabolic pathways driving the respiration of sulfur and iron compounds in D. alkaliphilus strains.;  We also aimed to propose how the interrelations between the redox transformations of iron and sulfur compounds within a single species might affect its adaptation to geochemically contrasting extreme environments.;  Here we focused on determining its optimal growth conditions, the ability to reduce sulfur compounds and capacity for chemoorganotrophic growth.;  The capability for dissimilatory reduction of sulfur compounds (S0 (1% w/v); S2O32− (10 mM); SO42− (20 mM)) was tested with formate (1 g L−1), H2 (10% v/v in the gas phase), ethanol or organic acids (10 mM in each case) added as the electron donors.;  The ability to disproportionate sulfur or thiosulfate was tested without the addition of any of the electron donors.; Screening of the genomes of both D. alkaliphilus strains for multiheme cytochromes and their sequence analysis was performed as previously described (Toshchakov et al., 2018) using reported cytochromes, involved in extracellular electron transfer (EET) in Geobacter sulfurreducens, Shewanella oneidensis, “Thermincola potens,” Carboxydothermus ferrireducens (Gavrilov et al., 2021 and references therein), the dataset of cytochrome query sequences was supplemented with multiheme proteins reported to be involved in Fe(III) respiration or other EET processes in the thermophilic Fe(III) reducers Carboxydocella thermautotrophica (Toshchakov et al., 2018) and Melioribacter roseus (Gavrilov et al., 2017), anaerobic Fe(II) oxidizing bacteria Sideroxydans lithotrophicus, Gallionella capsiferriformans, and Dechloromonas aromatica (Chakraborty et al., 2005; Emerson et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2012), Fe(III) reducing and syntrophic archaea (Mardanov et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2015; Krukenberg et al., 2018; Kashyap and Holden, 2021).;  Strain Z-1002 was unable to use elemental sulfur and sulfate as the electron acceptors, as well as it was unable to disproportionate sulfur or thiosulfate.; Strain AHT1T has been previously reported to possess a wide repertoire of multiheme c-type cytochromes including those thought to be involved in nitrate reduction, redox transformation of sulfur and Fe(III) compounds (Melton et al., 2017; Zavarzina et al., 2018; Sorokin and Merkel, 2019).;  Another large cluster of EET-related multiheme genes in strain Z-1002 is 3-Fe which also encodes an MtoA homolog (27% identity) OMD50_RS13520, completely identical to DealDRAFT_1,457, as well as the homologs (26–28% identity) of the periplasmic DmsE and outer cell surface OmcX cytochromes involved in the EET pathways of S. oneidensis and G. sulfurreducens, respectively.; It was previously noted that the sulfur- and thiosulfate reducing type strain of D. alkaliphilus does not possess any canonical determinants of sulfate, sulfur, or thiosulfate respiration—neither DsrAB complexes, nor molybdopterin oxidoreductases.;  In addition, we have identified the clusters encoding [NiFe] hydrogenases of the Group 3b together with beta and gamma sulfur reductase subunits of sulfhydrogenase complexes in both strains.;  Such enzyme complexes are proposed to harbor the activity, reducing elemental sulfur with molecular hydrogen (Ma et al., 1993).;  However, strain Z-1002, incapable of sulfur reduction, possesses a sulfhydrogenase cluster too, that raises doubts about the involvement of sulfhydrogenases in sulfur respiration of D. alkaliphilus.;  The difference between the two strains was observed in putative octaheme determinants of sulfur reduction.;  Notably, the protein DealDRAFT_1917 was previously misidentified as a thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (Melton et al., 2017).;  The sulfur reducing type strain AHT1T possesses an additional homolog of Otr, DealDRAFT-1,454, which is encoded in the cluster 3-Fe-T (Figure 4) and has no homologs among the proteins of strain Z-1002.; To assess the relevance of the identified multihemes for EET and to detect any accessory proteins involved in electron transfer to Fe(III) or sulfur compounds, as well as from Fe(II) minerals, the results of a shotgun proteomic analysis of cells, harvested at late logarithmic growth phase, were compared across two different cultivation conditions for each strain.;  Thus, Dethiobacter is the most abundant in sulfur- or iron-enriched alkaline natural habitats.; Currently, Dethiobacter alkaliphilus, the only cultured representative of the class “Dethiobacteria,” harbors two strains with contrasting adaptation to the conditions favoring iron or sulfur cycling.;  The type strain is a sulfidogen capable of elemental sulfur reduction (Sorokin et al., 2008), as well as of chemolithoautotrophic sulfur disproportionation (Poser et al., 2013, 2016), while strain Z-1002 appears to be incapable of sulfur reduction at all.; Both D. alkaliphilus strains appeared to lack canonical genomic determinants of sulfur, sulfate or thiosulfate reduction, such as DsrAB or molybdopterin-containing complexes.;  The sulfur-reducing type strain possesses an additional weak homolog of Otr proteins, DealDRAFT_1454 (20% identity).;  Phylogenetic reconstruction of these putative determinants of sulfur compounds reduction revealed deep branching of three of them from the common ancestor of SirA and Otr proteins, and association of two D. alkaliphilus proteins with OcwA/OmhA Fe(III) reductases (Figure 5), which are structurally similar to, but phylogenetically distant from octaheme sulfite or tetrathionate reductases (Soares et al., 2022).;  The highest expression level in these cells was detected for the protein DealDRAFT_2539 homologous (24% identity) to OmcN Fe(III)-reducing outer surface cytochrome of G. sulfurreducens (Aklujkar et al., 2013).;  All these facts emphasize that the reduction of sulfur compounds in D. alkaliphilus is most likely driven by multiheme cytochromes homologous to Fe-cycling proteins.; We have experimentally demonstrated the ability of the sulfur-reducing strain AHT1T to reduce Fe(III) from SF and the ability of the Fe(III)-reducing strain Z-1002 to oxidize Fe(II) from green rust supplied as a mixture with siderite.;  In general, multi-omics analysis revealed that the biochemical machinery of Fe redox cycling in D. alkaliphilus strains is more complex and flexible than that of sulfur respiration.;  These facts highlight the intricate weaving of EET pathways, that determine the redox transformations of sulfur and iron compounds in the organism, which could be a manifestation of the active evolution of multiheme proteins within D. alkaliphilus species, characteristic of the ongoing adaptation of an evolving population to the changes in its environment (Zheng et al., 2019).; Our analysis of the distribution of Dethiobacters in natural environments revealed that the representatives of this genus show strong addiction to two peculiar alkaline, sulfur- or iron-enriched ecotopes, soda lakes and serpentinite-associated sediments, respectively (Supplementary Figure S5).;  Since then, the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur has become one of the major factors determining the physicochemical conditions in soda lakes and influencing the evolution of their inhabitants.;  The presence of multiheme cytochromes, sharing their phylogenetic root with OmhA/OcwA Fe(III)-reductases, as the only possible determinants of the reduction of sulfur compounds in D. alkaliphilus allows us to propose that soda lakes are secondary habitats for these organisms comparing to Fe-rich subsurface environments associated with serpentinites.;  In this case, the Fe-reducing D. alkaliphilus could be an alien species for lacustrine sulfur-rich sediments, which was introduced there from the underlying Fe-rich volcanic rocks.;  The strain was managed to modify its multiheme cytochrome machinery under the evolutionary pressure of renewed geochemical settings with predominant sulfur cycle.;  A large number of different multiheme cytochrome genes and complete absence of typical genes determining the redox transformations of sulfur compounds could favor the adaptation of Dethiobacter to an ecotope where Fe-rich rocks are combined with sulfur-enriched sediments and waters.;  This fact together with the unity of origin of the sulfur, thiosulfate and Fe(III) reduction pathways in D. alkaliphilus, allows us to propose an adaptation strategy of the organism to the change of its environment from serpentinizing Fe-rich ecotopes to soda lakes.;  This strategy is based on the changes in the multiheme cytochrome repertoire aimed to get energy from the reduction of electron acceptors with lower redox potential (sulfur compounds vs.;  Such an example of intraspecific microevolution within D. alkaliphilus shows a possible way of a global adaptive response of prokaryotes to the activation of the sulfur cycle after the appearance of sulfates in the oceanic water and free oxygen in the atmosphere during GOE (Catling and Zahnle, 2020).;

"thiosulfate","D013885",37520367,10376724," The type strain AHT1T was described as a facultative chemolithoautotrophic sulfidogen reducing or disproportionating sulfur or thiosulfate, while strain Z-1002 was isolated as a chemolithoautotrophic iron reducer.;  Here, we uncovered the iron reducing ability of strain AHT1T and the ability of strain Z-1002 for thiosulfate reduction and anaerobic Fe(II) oxidation.;  Proteomic profiling revealed two distinct sets of multiheme cytochromes upregulated in iron(III)- or thiosulfate-respiring cells and the cytochromes peculiar for Fe(II) oxidizing cells.;  An important phenomenon observed in the sediments of Kulunda soda lakes (Altai region, Russia) is that sulfidogens using elemental sulfur and thiosulfate as electron acceptors are more active there than sulfate reducers despite the higher abundance of sulfates in the ecosystem (Sorokin et al., 2011).; Dethiobacter alkaliphilus, the only cultured representative of the genus Dethiobacter, was isolated from mixed anaerobic sediments of northeastern Mongolian soda lakes, and was described as a sulfur- and thiosulfate-reducing, facultatively chemolithoautotrophic sulfidogen utilizing H2 and a range of organic electron donors, strain AHT1T (Sorokin et al., 2008).;  The organism is also capable of sulfur or thiosulfate disproportionation (Poser et al., 2013, 2016).;  Thus, the two cultured strains AHT1T and Z-1002 of the single species of the class “Dethiobacteria” were isolated as sulfur/thiosulfate- and iron-reducers, respectively, from the sediments of soda lakes located on two different continents.;  The ability to disproportionate sulfur or thiosulfate was tested without the addition of any of the electron donors.; For proteomic analysis, biomass of D. alkaliphilus strain AHT1T grown with H2 and thiosulfate or SF as the electron acceptors was harvested from 100 mL cultures by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 15 min.;  Strain Z-1002 grew chemoorganotrophically with lactate, succinate, butyrate, pyruvate, propionate, or ethanol as the electron donors and SF or thiosulfate as the electron acceptors.;  Slow growth with a low cell yield of 5 × 105 cells mL−1, accompanied by the production of 2.5 mM sulfide, was observed on thiosulfate with the addition of formate or H2 as electron donor.;  The most intense thiosulfate reduction accompanied by the formation of 15 mM sulfide was observed with ethanol as the electron donor.;  Strain Z-1002 was unable to use elemental sulfur and sulfate as the electron acceptors, as well as it was unable to disproportionate sulfur or thiosulfate.; It was previously noted that the sulfur- and thiosulfate reducing type strain of D. alkaliphilus does not possess any canonical determinants of sulfate, sulfur, or thiosulfate respiration—neither DsrAB complexes, nor molybdopterin oxidoreductases.;  Notably, the protein DealDRAFT_1917 was previously misidentified as a thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (Melton et al., 2017).;  The strain AHT1T was cultured with ferrihydrite or thiosulfate, and the strain Z-1002 was cultured with ferrihydrite or the mixture of Fe(II) minerals (siderite, green rust, and iron oxides).;  A clear difference in multiheme cytochrome profiles was observed between ferrihydrite- and thiosulfate-grown cells.;  In contrast, the protein DealDRAFT_1,457 appeared to be the only one exclusively expressed in thiosulfate reducing cells (Figure 6A).;  In thiosulfate-grown AHT1T cells, the highest expression level was detected for the multiheme DealDRAFT_2,539 (Figure 6A) but in this case, the difference in the expression level was not statistically supported by the imputation procedure due to the absence of DealDRAFT_2,539 protein in one of the three preparations of the thiosulfate-grown biomass.;  Statistically relevant upregulation was observed for the proteins DealDRAFT_0324, 1087, 1093, 1435, 1439, and 1441 under ferrihydrite reduction and for the proteins DealDRAFT_1443, 1451, 1670, and 1917 (Figure 6B) under thiosulfate reduction.;  In addition, the cytochrome DealDRAFT_2033 was overexpressed in thiosulfate-grown cells (Figure 6A) but the absence of this protein in two of three preparations of ferrihydrite-grown biomass did not statistically support the differences in its expression level.;  Interestingly, four of the six multihemes upregulated in thiosulfate-grown cells (DealDRAFT_1443, 1451, 1670, and 2539) were also homologous to various cytochromes related to Fe(III) reduction (Supplementary Table S1).;  Only a single protein homologous to SirA sulfite reductase (22% identity), DealDRAFT_1917, was reliably upregulated during D. alkaliphilus growth on thiosulfate.;  For the strain AHT1T, (A,B) ferrihydrite- and thiosulfate-grown cells are compared.;  For the strain Z-1002, Fe(III) reducing and Fe(II) oxidizing cells are compared. (A) Molar proportions (riBAQs) of individual multiheme cytochrome proteins of AHT1T strain cultures, (B) statistically supported upregulation of individual multihemes in ferrihydrite-grown vs. thiosulfate-grown cells of the strain AHT1T, (C) statistically supported upregulation of individual multihemes in ferrihydrite-reducing vs.;  Brown plus signs on (A) mark the cytochromes which upregulation in AHT1T ferrihydrite-grown cells was statistically supported (B), yellow plus signs mark reproducibly upregulated proteins in thiosulfate-grown cells (B), gray plus signs indicate the proteins which differential expression was not statistically supported.;  On panel (B), upregulation in thiosulfate grown cells is visualized by negative values of log2(fold changes).;  However, both strains are capable of thiosulfate reduction (Table 2).; Both D. alkaliphilus strains appeared to lack canonical genomic determinants of sulfur, sulfate or thiosulfate reduction, such as DsrAB or molybdopterin-containing complexes.; Multiheme cytochrome profiling revealed upregulation of the protein DealDRAFT_1917, homologous to SirA, in the cells of the strain AHT1T grown with thiosulfate (Figure 6).;  Interestingly, the protein DealDRAFT_1457 homologous to MtoA Fe(II) oxidase was only detected in thiosulfate-grown cells.;  Furthermore, the most pronounced upregulation in thiosulfate-reducing cells was observed for DealDRAFT_1451 and 1670 (Figure 6) homologous to the putative Fe(III) reductases SmhB and SmhC (21 and 32% identity, respectively, Supplementary Table S1).;  Importantly, the majority of the cytochromes overexpressed under ferrihydrite- or thiosulfate-reducing conditions in the strain AHT1T are encoded in three largest gene clusters (Figure 4), which also encode auxiliary flavin-containing electron transfer proteins together with NHL- and TPR-repeat-containing proteins that could be involved in protein–protein interactions mediating the assembly of multiprotein complexes (D’Andrea and Regan, 2003), such as MtrCAB Fe(III)-reducing ones (Shi et al., 2012).;  This fact together with the unity of origin of the sulfur, thiosulfate and Fe(III) reduction pathways in D. alkaliphilus, allows us to propose an adaptation strategy of the organism to the change of its environment from serpentinizing Fe-rich ecotopes to soda lakes.;  Strain Z-1002 is unable to reduce elemental sulfur or disproportionate thiosulfate and elemental sulfur.;  Strain Z-1002 is able to reduce thiosulfate or anaerobically oxidize Fe(II)-containing minerals."
"iron","D007501",37520367,10376724," The type strain AHT1T was described as a facultative chemolithoautotrophic sulfidogen reducing or disproportionating sulfur or thiosulfate, while strain Z-1002 was isolated as a chemolithoautotrophic iron reducer.;  Here, we uncovered the iron reducing ability of strain AHT1T and the ability of strain Z-1002 for thiosulfate reduction and anaerobic Fe(II) oxidation.;  Key catabolic processes sustaining the growth of both D. alkaliphilus strains appeared to fit the geochemical settings of two contrasting natural alkaline environments, sulfur-enriched soda lakes and iron-enriched serpentinites.;  Genome analysis revealed multiheme c-type cytochromes to be the most probable determinants of iron and sulfur redox transformations in D. alkaliphilus.;  Proteomic profiling revealed two distinct sets of multiheme cytochromes upregulated in iron(III)- or thiosulfate-respiring cells and the cytochromes peculiar for Fe(II) oxidizing cells.;  We suggest that maintaining high variation in multiheme cytochromes is an effective adaptive strategy to occupy geochemically contrasting alkaline environments.;  We propose that sulfur-enriched soda lakes could be secondary habitats for D. alkaliphilus compared to Fe-rich serpentinites, and that the ongoing evolution of Dethiobacterales could retrace the evolutionary path that may have occurred in prokaryotes at a turning point in the biosphere’s history, when the intensification of the sulfur cycle outweighed the global significance of the iron cycle.;  Inspite of the predominance of the sulfur cycle, several species and genera of iron reducers have been isolated from soda lakes and their wide distribution in these ecosystems has been further reported (Zavarzina et al., 2016).;  Importantly, most dissimilatory alkaliphilic iron reducers are capable of using sulfur as an alternative electron acceptor, just as many alkaliphilic sulfidogens have been shown to reduce Fe(III) (Zavarzina et al., 2018).;  Thus, the two cultured strains AHT1T and Z-1002 of the single species of the class “Dethiobacteria” were isolated as sulfur/thiosulfate- and iron-reducers, respectively, from the sediments of soda lakes located on two different continents.; Interestingly, Dethiobacter-related phylotypes have been previously detected exclusively in alkaline environments (pH ≥ 7.5) of two different types, the sediments of soda or meromictic lakes, and subsurface ecosystems affected by serpentinization processes.;  Representatives of Dethiobacter genus were detected in the sediments of a meromictic Mahoney lake, in soda lakes Mono, Van and those of the Kulunda Steppe (Hamilton et al., 2016; Edwardson and Hollibaugh, 2017, 2018; Vavourakis et al., 2018; Ersoy Omeroglu et al., 2021), as well as in several serpentinizing ophiolites, serpentinization-based subseafloor ecosystems, and terrestrial subsurface environments (Brazelton et al., 2013; Suko et al., 2013; Suzuki et al., 2013; Tiago and Veríssimo, 2013; Crespo-Medina et al., 2014; Glaring et al., 2015; López-López et al., 2015; Postec et al., 2015; Woycheese et al., 2015; Purkamo et al., 2016, 2017; Pisapia et al., 2017; Sabuda et al., 2020, 2021).;  Serpentinization is a widespread geochemical phenomenon involving the aqueous alteration of ultramafic rocks, containing the Fe-rich mineral olivine [(Mg,Fe)2SiO4], to serpentine [(Mg,Fe,)2-3(Si,Fe)2O5(OH)4]. The process results in the formation of a highly alkaline (pH > 10) and strongly reducing, H2-rich fluid, which creates thermodynamically favorable environmental conditions for abiotic organic synthesis from slab-derived inorganic carbon (McCollom and Bach, 2009).; The aim of our work was to fill the knowledge gap on the metabolic pathways driving the respiration of sulfur and iron compounds in D. alkaliphilus strains.;  We also aimed to propose how the interrelations between the redox transformations of iron and sulfur compounds within a single species might affect its adaptation to geochemically contrasting extreme environments.;  The ability of strain AHT1T for dissimilatory iron-reduction was tested in an optimal liquid medium of the following composition (per liter distilled water): NH4Cl 0.5 g; KH2PO4, 0.2 g; MgCl2 × 6H2O 0.1 g; CaCl2 × 2H2O 0.02 g; KCl 0.2 g; NaCl 3.0 g; Na2CO3 15.0 g; NaHCO3 20.0 g; Na2S × 9H2O 0.1 g; 1 mL trace element solution (Kevbrin and Zavarzin, 1992); 1 mL vitamin solution (Wolin et al., 1963); yeast extract 0.2 g.;  The presence of the Fe(III)-containing green rust (10.6%) and iron oxides (13%) in the mineral mixture was detected by Mössbauer spectroscopy (Table 1).;  After storage, the flask was supplemented with SF [final Fe(III) content of 10 mM], sodium sulfate, sodium acetate, and sodium formate (10 mM each), and used as a primary enrichment of sulfate and iron reducing microorganisms inhabiting the mineral water.;  This method allows for the determination and quantification of different atomic environments, magnetic states, chemical states and transformations of iron-containing compounds (Kamnev and Tugarova, 2021).; We used 16S rRNA gene sequences and related metadata to analyze the relative abundance of Dethiobacters in different environments.; Considering the metabolic features of D. alkaliphilus isolate from the lake Magadi, we tested the ability of the type strain AHT1T for dissimilatory iron reduction.;  Ferrihydrite-grown cells of both D. alkaliphilus strains were strongly associated with iron minerals (Figure 2).; Cultures of the strain Z-1002 appeared to oxidize Fe(II) from a natural mixture of hydrothermal siderite (76%), green rust (11%), and iron oxides (13%) under anaerobic conditions in the absence of any organic compounds.;  Mössbauer analysis of the minerals from the grown cultures (stationary growth phase) and uninoculated controls revealed a decrease in the relative total intensity of the spectra corresponding to ferrous iron atoms from 87.7 ± 2.9% to 78.2 ± 0.9% in the grown cultures (Table 1).;  This means that 75% of the bivalent iron atoms contained in the green rust were oxidized.;  Thus, on the one hand, we have observed a rearrangement of the bivalent and trivalent iron atoms in the green rust, and on the other hand, an increase in the amount of iron oxides in the mixture.;  According to the results of our phylogenomic analysis based on the same method, the MAGs of the Dethiobacteraceae family appeared to form two distinct phylogenetic clusters: one containing D. alkaliphilus and the MAGs from serpentinizing environments, and another containing MAGs from anaerobic digestion facilities and organic wastes (Figure 3).;  The strain AHT1T was cultured with ferrihydrite or thiosulfate, and the strain Z-1002 was cultured with ferrihydrite or the mixture of Fe(II) minerals (siderite, green rust, and iron oxides).;  The sample was then stored at +4°C for 1.5 years and then used for the enrichment of prokaryotes inhabiting the deep subsurface aquifer using a mixture of electron donors and acceptors available in this environment.;  To check the presence of iron reducers in the obtained enrichment, it was transferred to selective media containing formate (10 mM) or acetate (10 mM) with SF (50 mM final Fe(III) content) as the only electron acceptor.; 16S rRNA gene-based profiling of environmental samples and enrichment cultures from subsurface mineral water of the Lower Cretaceous aquifer of YMWD.; The survey of the environmental distribution of 16S rRNA gene sequences of the genus Dethiobacter available in public databases shows that about 25% of the sequences are retrieved from sediments of soda lakes and alkaline soils, 35% of the sequences are retrieved from Fe-enriched serpentinites, about 30%—from anaerobic bioreactors and digesters (Supplementary Figure S5).;  Thus, Dethiobacter is the most abundant in sulfur- or iron-enriched alkaline natural habitats.;  However, the representatives of the genus have also been detected in anthropogenic organics-rich neutrophilic environments.;  Unfortunately, the lack of publicly available data on the physico-chemical conditions sustained in these anthropogenic environments, and on the sources of wastewaters treated there do not allow us to discuss the phylogenetic group of Dethiobacteraceae detected in bioreactors in the context of the evolution of their metabolic capacities.; Currently, Dethiobacter alkaliphilus, the only cultured representative of the class “Dethiobacteria,” harbors two strains with contrasting adaptation to the conditions favoring iron or sulfur cycling.;  These facts highlight the intricate weaving of EET pathways, that determine the redox transformations of sulfur and iron compounds in the organism, which could be a manifestation of the active evolution of multiheme proteins within D. alkaliphilus species, characteristic of the ongoing adaptation of an evolving population to the changes in its environment (Zheng et al., 2019).; Our analysis of the distribution of Dethiobacters in natural environments revealed that the representatives of this genus show strong addiction to two peculiar alkaline, sulfur- or iron-enriched ecotopes, soda lakes and serpentinite-associated sediments, respectively (Supplementary Figure S5).;  Serpentinizing environments have been stable throughout the Earth’s geological evolution, whereas soda lakes are subjected to continuous biogeochemical development, being surfaceous ecosystems (Stüeken et al., 2015; Furnes and Dilek, 2022).;  The presence of multiheme cytochromes, sharing their phylogenetic root with OmhA/OcwA Fe(III)-reductases, as the only possible determinants of the reduction of sulfur compounds in D. alkaliphilus allows us to propose that soda lakes are secondary habitats for these organisms comparing to Fe-rich subsurface environments associated with serpentinites.;  Thus, the bedrock of the modern lake appeared to be enriched with iron minerals.; Better fitness of the metabolic features of Dethiobacters to the life in Fe-rich alkaline environments was highlighted by the enrichment of their phylotypes from the Lower Cretaceous aquifer of the Yessentukskoye subsurface mineral water deposit (YMWD).;  The crystalline basement of the deposit is represented by Proterozoic-Paleozoic metamorphic and magmatic shales and granites, i.e., the rocks depleted with iron-bearing minerals.;  The sedimentary cover of the YMWD is represented by iron-depleted limestones, mudstones and siltstones of Meso-Cenozoic age.;  This environment is completely different from those formed by serpentinization processes.;  Not surprisingly, Dethiobacter-related phylotypes comprised a minor part (0.08%) of the microbial community in this aquifer and rather represented the so-called “rare biosphere,” which is considered a phenotypic repository of microbial communities getting advantages upon significant changes of environmental conditions (Jousset et al., 2017).;  This fact together with the unity of origin of the sulfur, thiosulfate and Fe(III) reduction pathways in D. alkaliphilus, allows us to propose an adaptation strategy of the organism to the change of its environment from serpentinizing Fe-rich ecotopes to soda lakes.; In addition to the characteristics given for the type strain of the species, AHT1T (Sorokin et al., 2008; Poser et al., 2013, 2016; Sorokin and Merkel, 2019), and strain Z-1002 (Zavarzina et al., 2018), the following characteristics should be added to the formal description: both strains of the type species can grow by iron-reduction in the presence of molecular hydrogen, formate, acetate, lactate, succinate, pyruvate, butyrate, propionate or ethanol as the electron donors."

 SF was added to the culture medium prior to sterilization to achieve a final Fe(III) content of 50 mM.;  Sodium formate (1 g l−1) and SF [final Fe(III) content of 50 mM] were added to test the Fe(III) reducing activity under optimal growth conditions.; The ability to oxidize a natural siderite-based mineral mixture (Fe2CO3 as the major component) under anaerobic conditions was tested using an optimized medium without sodium sulfide with the following composition (per liter distilled water): NH4Cl 0.5 g;

 The mineral phase changed from brownish to dark brown color during the growth, indicating the formation of Fe(II)-containing minerals (Supplementary Figures S1).;  Ferrihydrite-grown cells of both D. alkaliphilus strains were strongly associated with iron minerals (Figure 2).; Kinetics of hydrogenotrophic growth of strain AHT1T with ferrihydrite as the electron acceptor, hydrogen consumption and Fe(II) production in the absence of yeast extract and sodium sulfide.; Cultures of the strain Z-1002 appeared to oxidize Fe(II) from a natural mixture of hydrothermal siderite (76%), green rust (11%), and iron oxides (13%) under anaerobic conditions in the absence of any organic compounds.;  Growth was accompanied by the changes in the mineral phase as no soluble Fe(III) or Fe(II) species were detected in the culture during the incubation.;  The relative intensity of siderite subspectrum of the microbially impacted mineral sample remained virtually unchanged, but the intensity of the doublet corresponding to Fe2+ atoms in the green rust structure decreased from 8.4 ± 2.1% to 2.1 ± 0.6%, while the intensity of the doublet corresponding to Fe3+ atoms in this phase increased from 2.2 ± 0.5% to 4.6 ± 0.4% (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S3).;  These are identical clusters of genes encoding [NiFe] uptake hydrogenase (HydABC) and its assembly proteins HypDEF, complete gene sets of V-type Na+-ATP synthetase, and the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway for autotrophic CO2 fixation, which includes an operon comprising a CODH gene cooS followed by acsABCDE genes of acetyl-CoA-synthetase and separately located genes encoding the methylTHF branch of the pathway and a formate dehydrogenase.; Strain AHT1T has been previously reported to possess a wide repertoire of multiheme c-type cytochromes including those thought to be involved in nitrate reduction, redox transformation of sulfur and Fe(III) compounds (Melton et al., 2017; Zavarzina et al., 2018; Sorokin and Merkel, 2019).;  The majority of multihemes from both D. alkaliphilus strains share similarity with the proteins previously reported to be involved in EET to Fe(III) minerals in Geobacter, Shewanella, Thermincola, Carboxydothermus species, or in Fe(III)-reducing archaea (Supplementary Table S1).;  In addition, 2 multihemes from AHT1T and 3 multihemes from Z-1002 share similarities (22–27% identity) with MtoA-type outer surface cytochromes that perform the reverse EET process of Fe(II) oxidation within MtoABC porin-cytochrome complexes (Shi et al., 2012).;  The majority of EET-related multihemes, whether putative Fe(III) reductases or Fe(II) oxidases, are encoded by clustered genes in both strains of D. alkaliphilus.;  The cluster 1-Fe-T (of the type strain AHT1T) contains 3 multiheme genes homologous to those of SmhB cytochrome (38% identity) specific for soluble Fe(III) complexes in C. ferrireducens (Gavrilov et al., 2021), the key multiheme MtrA (22% identity) of the EET pathway in S. oneidensis which transfers electrons across the outer membrane to extracellular acceptors (Campbell et al., 2022), and a homolog of a quinol-oxidizing multiheme CymA (34% identity) that initiates the metal-reducing pathway in S. oneidensis (Shi et al., 2016).;  Cluster 1-Fe-T also encodes NHL- and TPR-repeat-containing proteins and includes a regulatory region downstream of the cytochrome genes.;  Cluster 2-Fe-T in strain AHT1T encodes two homologs (25 and 30% identity) of secreted c-type cytochromes from Gram-positive thermophilic Fe(III)-reducers “T. potens” and C. ferrireducens together with NHL- and TPR-repeat-containing proteins and electron transfer flavoproteins.;  The largest cluster 3-Fe-T of AHT1T, which was previously mispredicted to include the locus DealDRAFT_1428–35 (Zavarzina et al., 2018), encodes nine multiheme cytochromes.;  In total, seven multihemes of the 3-Fe-T cluster have homologs in strain Z-1002 (Figure 4).;  In addition to cytochromes, the 3-Fe-T cluster of strain AHT1T contains the genes of several NHL- and TPR-repeat-containing proteins and a component of an ABC-type transport system.;  Genes are colored according to their predicted products: green—flavoproteins, blue—transport system proteins, light blue—NHL- and TPR-repeat-containing proteins, pink—rhodanese domain-containing proteins, red—homologs of putative terminal Fe(III) reductases, olive—homologs of various EET-related secreted multihemes, light brown—homologs of MtoA-type Fe(II) oxidases, dark orange—homologs of octaheme SirA sulfite reductases and Otr tetrathionate reductases, yellow—putative quinol oxidases, gray—other proteins including hypothetical ones.;  Similar genes of multiheme cytochromes in the clusters 3-Fe-T, 2-Fe, and 3-Fe are marked with differentially colored rectangles.;  Clusters 4-Fe-T and 1-Fe, 5-T and 4, as well as 6-T and 5 are almost identical to each other, that is not specially marked on the scheme.;  The largest cluster 2-Fe encodes three homologs of the DealDRAFT_1,439 protein mentioned above (38–87% identity, Supplementary Table S1).;  Two of these homologs share similarity with the MtoA Fe(II)-oxidizing cytochrome (23 and 29% identity), and one—with phylogenetically related MtrD Fe(III)-reducing cytochrome (24% identity).;  Other multihemes encoded within the 2-Fe cluster of strain Z-1002 share homology with the CymA quinol-oxidizing cytochrome (35% identity) and auxiliary EET-related proteins of C. ferrireducens and S. oneidensis (29–31% identity).;  Another large cluster of EET-related multiheme genes in strain Z-1002 is 3-Fe which also encodes an MtoA homolog (27% identity) OMD50_RS13520, completely identical to DealDRAFT_1,457, as well as the homologs (26–28% identity) of the periplasmic DmsE and outer cell surface OmcX cytochromes involved in the EET pathways of S. oneidensis and G. sulfurreducens, respectively.;  These small clusters encode the homologs of putative Fe(III) reducing multihemes (31–33% identity, clusters 4-Fe-T and 1-Fe), putative quinol-oxidizing cytochromes (29–32% identity, clusters 6-T and 5), and the cytochromes homologous to SirA/MccA-like sulfite reductases and rhodanese domain proteins (clusters 5-T and 4, see below).; Considering a rare case of the appearance of both Fe(III) reduction, and Fe(II) oxidation determinants in a single organism, we have analyzed the homologs of MtoA proteins from D. alkaliphilus strains in more detail.;  The same domain was identified in the protein OMD50_RS09855 homologous to the MtrD Fe(III)-reducing cytochrome of S. oneidensis (22% identity), as well as to DealDRAFT_1457 MtoA-like protein which only possesses multiheme conserved domains (29% identity, Supplementary Table S1).;  Phylogenetic reconstruction of the multiheme domains of all the MtoA-like proteins from both D. alkaliphilus strains (DealDRAFT_1439, 1454, 1457, and OMD50_RS14355, 14365, 13520), together with related MtrA/D homologs from this species (DealDRAFT_1094, OMD50_RS14375, 09855), revealed separate clustering and deep phylogenetic branching of all D. alkaliphilus proteins from previously described DmsE-family decahemes involved in Fe(II) oxidation or Fe(III) reduction (MtoA proteins or MtrA/D proteins, respectively, Supplementary Figure S4).;  In addition, we have identified the clusters encoding [NiFe] hydrogenases of the Group 3b together with beta and gamma sulfur reductase subunits of sulfhydrogenase complexes in both strains.;  The sulfur reducing type strain AHT1T possesses an additional homolog of Otr, DealDRAFT-1,454, which is encoded in the cluster 3-Fe-T (Figure 4) and has no homologs among the proteins of strain Z-1002.;  This fact correlates with recently revealed structural similarity between SirA/MccA octaheme sulfite reductases and OcwA/OmhA terminal Fe(III) reductases (Soares et al., 2022).;  Interestingly, the homologous proteins DealDRAFT_2033 and OMD50_RS05590 clustered together with the OcwA and OmhA Fe(III) reductases and branched off all the other analyzed cytochromes (Figure 5).; To assess the relevance of the identified multihemes for EET and to detect any accessory proteins involved in electron transfer to Fe(III) or sulfur compounds, as well as from Fe(II) minerals, the results of a shotgun proteomic analysis of cells, harvested at late logarithmic growth phase, were compared across two different cultivation conditions for each strain.;  The strain AHT1T was cultured with ferrihydrite or thiosulfate, and the strain Z-1002 was cultured with ferrihydrite or the mixture of Fe(II) minerals (siderite, green rust, and iron oxides).;  In ferrihydrite-grown cells of strain AHT1T, the highest relative abundance was observed for DealDRAFT-1,087 which is homologous to the SmhC (23% identity) Fe(III)-specific secreted multiheme of C. ferrireducens (Supplementary Table S1).;  The majority of the proteins with positive response to ferrihydrite provided as an electron acceptor are encoded in the clusters 1-Fe-T, 2-Fe-T, 3_Fe-T (Figure 4) and share homology with putative terminal Fe(III) reductases, secreted multihemes, and MtoA putative Fe(II) oxidase which is phylogenetically related to MtrA/MtrD Fe(III) oxidases (Shi et al., 2012).;  Interestingly, four of the six multihemes upregulated in thiosulfate-grown cells (DealDRAFT_1443, 1451, 1670, and 2539) were also homologous to various cytochromes related to Fe(III) reduction (Supplementary Table S1).;  For the strain Z-1002, Fe(III) reducing and Fe(II) oxidizing cells are compared. (A) Molar proportions (riBAQs) of individual multiheme cytochrome proteins of AHT1T strain cultures, (B) statistically supported upregulation of individual multihemes in ferrihydrite-grown vs. thiosulfate-grown cells of the strain AHT1T, (C) statistically supported upregulation of individual multihemes in ferrihydrite-reducing vs.;  Fe(II)-oxidizing cells of the strain Z-1002. (A) Presents the data for all the EET-related cytochromes of the strain AHT1T, which were identified in protein profiles.;  On panel (C), upregulation in Fe(II)-oxidizing cells of Z-1002 strain is visualized by negative values of log2(fold changes).;  Profiling of individual multiheme proteins uncovered nine EET-related multihemes that were differentially expressed under ferrihydrite reduction or Fe(II) oxidation.;  The cytochromes OMD50_RS14355, 14365, 14415, and 14880, homologous to MtoA Fe(II) oxidases, CymA-like quinol oxidase and OmhA terminal Fe(III) reductase, respectively (Supplementary Table S1), had almost similar expression levels under ferrihydrite reduction or Fe(II) oxidation (Figure 6C).;  The highest expression levels under both Fe(III)-reducing and Fe(II)-oxidizing conditions were observed for the OMD50_RS14385 and OMD50_RS14880 proteins (Supplementary Table S4) which are homologous to cell surface-associated cytochromes of C. ferrireducens (30 and 26% identity, respectively, Supplementary Table S1).;  These proteins are likely to comprise the core part of the EET pathway driving the redox transformation of Fe minerals in D. alkaliphilus.;  Interestingly, the cytochromes OMD50_RS02905 and 7,060, homologous to OmhA Fe(III) reductase and SirA sulfite reductase (25 and 23% identity, respectively) were exclusively expressed under Fe(II) oxidation, whereas a putative quinol oxidase OMD50_RS09530 showed the strongest upregulation under the same growth conditions (Figure 6C).;  To check the presence of iron reducers in the obtained enrichment, it was transferred to selective media containing formate (10 mM) or acetate (10 mM) with SF (50 mM final Fe(III) content) as the only electron acceptor.;  After 2 weeks of incubation, the color of the Fe mineral changed from reddish to dark-brown, which is characteristic of ferrihydrite reduction.;  Fluorescence microscopy of mineral samples taken from these cultures revealed that mineral particles were densely settled with rod-shaped cells of different length. 16S rRNA gene profiling of the Fe(III) reducing enrichments revealed the predominance of Dethiobacter phylotypes (96% identity with D. alkaliphilus) in the culture with SF and formate (33.2% relative abundance) and their complete absence in the culture with SF and acetate (Figure 7, 4th and 5th columns, respectively).; The survey of the environmental distribution of 16S rRNA gene sequences of the genus Dethiobacter available in public databases shows that about 25% of the sequences are retrieved from sediments of soda lakes and alkaline soils, 35% of the sequences are retrieved from Fe-enriched serpentinites, about 30%—from anaerobic bioreactors and digesters (Supplementary Figure S5).;  Phylogenetic reconstruction of these putative determinants of sulfur compounds reduction revealed deep branching of three of them from the common ancestor of SirA and Otr proteins, and association of two D. alkaliphilus proteins with OcwA/OmhA Fe(III) reductases (Figure 5), which are structurally similar to, but phylogenetically distant from octaheme sulfite or tetrathionate reductases (Soares et al., 2022).;  Interestingly, the protein DealDRAFT_1457 homologous to MtoA Fe(II) oxidase was only detected in thiosulfate-grown cells.;  Furthermore, the most pronounced upregulation in thiosulfate-reducing cells was observed for DealDRAFT_1451 and 1670 (Figure 6) homologous to the putative Fe(III) reductases SmhB and SmhC (21 and 32% identity, respectively, Supplementary Table S1).;  The highest expression level in these cells was detected for the protein DealDRAFT_2539 homologous (24% identity) to OmcN Fe(III)-reducing outer surface cytochrome of G. sulfurreducens (Aklujkar et al., 2013).;  All these facts emphasize that the reduction of sulfur compounds in D. alkaliphilus is most likely driven by multiheme cytochromes homologous to Fe-cycling proteins.; We have experimentally demonstrated the ability of the sulfur-reducing strain AHT1T to reduce Fe(III) from SF and the ability of the Fe(III)-reducing strain Z-1002 to oxidize Fe(II) from green rust supplied as a mixture with siderite.;  The result of Fe(II) oxidation by strain Z-1002 was indicated by a 6.4% increase in the relative intensity of the Mössbauer spectra of Fe3+ atoms compared to that of uninoculated controls (Table 1).; Genomic analysis revealed that each of the D. alkaliphilus strains contained a large set of genes encoding multiheme c-type cytochromes, including those homologous to quinol-oxidases, membrane-associated Fe(III) reductases, such as OcwA or MtrA/D, and soluble electron shuttling cytochromes, previously identified in the model Fe(III)-respiring bacteria of the genera Shewanella and Geobacter or in Gram-positive thermophilic Fe(III) reducers (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table S1).;  Taken together, these cytochromes could be combined in an electron transfer chain linking the membrane-bound respiratory complexes with extracellular electron acceptors, such as Fe(III)-containing minerals, or electron donors, such as Fe(II)-bearing mineral mixtures.;  Proteomic profiling of strain AHT1T for multihemes revealed strong upregulation of six different cytochromes, including the cytochrome DealDRAFT_1439 (Figure 6), encoded in three gene clusters of putative Fe(III) reductases (clusters 1-Fe-T, 2-Fe-T, 3-Fe-T, Figure 4).;  These cytochromes contain the homologs of all the necessary components of an extracellular electron transfer chain to Fe(III) oxides.;  Interestingly, the Fe(II)-oxidizing strain Z-1002 possesses four different homologs of the protein DealDRAFT_1,439 which are encoded in the 2-Fe and 3-Fe clusters.;  Of these, the proteins OMD50_RS14355 and OMD50_RS14365 share similarity with MtoA-type Fe(II)-oxidases (Shi et al., 2012).;  Phylogeny reconstruction of these and other MtoA homologs of D. alkaliphilus (DealDRAFT_1454, 1457, OMD50_RS14520) revealed clear separation of these proteins from DmsE-family decahemes of other organisms that perform Fe(III) reduction or Fe(II) oxidation (Supplementary Figure S4).;  Branching most deeply from the common ancestor of all the D. alkaliphilus decahemes is the phylogenetic cluster of MtoA-like cytochromes DealDRAFT_1439, OMD50_RS14355, and OMD50_RS14365 (Supplementary Figure S4), as well as the protein OMD50_RS14375 with closer homology (24% identity) to the MtrD Fe(III)-reducing cytochrome of S. oneidensis (Shi et al., 2012).;  We propose that three of the four proteins in this phylogenetic cluster might appear in strain Z-1002 by several duplication events with further minor changes occurred under the evolutionary pressure of the conditions favoring Fe-cycling, such as increased abundance of mixed Fe(III)/Fe(II)-containing minerals.;  Such an assumption correlates with the similarity of expression levels of two MtoA-like cytochromes in strain Z-1002 cells grown under ferrihydrite reducing or Fe(II) oxidizing conditions (Supplementary Table S4 and Figure 6C).;  In general, multi-omics analysis revealed that the biochemical machinery of Fe redox cycling in D. alkaliphilus strains is more complex and flexible than that of sulfur respiration.;  Importantly, the majority of the cytochromes overexpressed under ferrihydrite- or thiosulfate-reducing conditions in the strain AHT1T are encoded in three largest gene clusters (Figure 4), which also encode auxiliary flavin-containing electron transfer proteins together with NHL- and TPR-repeat-containing proteins that could be involved in protein–protein interactions mediating the assembly of multiprotein complexes (D’Andrea and Regan, 2003), such as MtrCAB Fe(III)-reducing ones (Shi et al., 2012).;  Interestingly, the putative Fe-cycling multiheme proteins of D. alkaliphilus showed greater divergence from each other than that observed among the EET-related proteins of the DmsE family from fairly different bacteria.;  Another important point is that the homologs of OmhA Fe(III) reductase and SirA sulfite reductase are expressed only under Fe(II) oxidation in strain Z-1002.;  The presence of multiheme cytochromes, sharing their phylogenetic root with OmhA/OcwA Fe(III)-reductases, as the only possible determinants of the reduction of sulfur compounds in D. alkaliphilus allows us to propose that soda lakes are secondary habitats for these organisms comparing to Fe-rich subsurface environments associated with serpentinites.;  This hypothesis correlates with the geological history and current geochemical characteristics of Magadi soda lake from which the Fe-reducing strain Z-1002 was isolated.;  In this case, the Fe-reducing D. alkaliphilus could be an alien species for lacustrine sulfur-rich sediments, which was introduced there from the underlying Fe-rich volcanic rocks.;  A large number of different multiheme cytochrome genes and complete absence of typical genes determining the redox transformations of sulfur compounds could favor the adaptation of Dethiobacter to an ecotope where Fe-rich rocks are combined with sulfur-enriched sediments and waters.; Better fitness of the metabolic features of Dethiobacters to the life in Fe-rich alkaline environments was highlighted by the enrichment of their phylotypes from the Lower Cretaceous aquifer of the Yessentukskoye subsurface mineral water deposit (YMWD).;  The phylotypes restored when the enrichment conditions became favorable for alkaliphilic lithotrophic Fe(III) reducers.;  Thus, Fe-rich alkaline conditions seem to be optimal geochemical settings for yet uncultured Dethiobacter species.;  This fact together with the unity of origin of the sulfur, thiosulfate and Fe(III) reduction pathways in D. alkaliphilus, allows us to propose an adaptation strategy of the organism to the change of its environment from serpentinizing Fe-rich ecotopes to soda lakes.;  Fe(III) minerals).;  Strain Z-1002 is able to reduce thiosulfate or anaerobically oxidize Fe(II)-containing minerals.; This research was partially funded by the Russian Science Foundation (grant no. 21-14-00333) (DZ, SG, and VP, physiological studies, enrichments, genome analysis), and by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation (AK, IE, and AYM, genome sequencing, phylogenetic analysis)."
"Polyproline","C011083",37303170,10265654," Polyproline
was synthesized by aqueous open-air ring-opening N-carboxyanhydride polymerization, giving rise to polypeptides of
up to 50 kg mol–1."
"polyproline","C011083",37303170,10265654," Here we investigate
high molecular weight polyproline as an ice recrystallization inhibitor
(IRI).;  Low molecular weight polyproline is known to be a weak IRI.
Its activity is hypothesized to be due to the unique PPI helix it
adopts, but it has not been thoroughly investigated.;  Here an open-to-air
aqueous N-carboxyanhydride polymerization is employed
to obtain polyproline with molecular weights of up to 50000 g mol–1.;  The polyprolines exhibited lower critical solution temperature
behavior and assembly/aggregation observed at room temperature, which
may contribute to its activity.;  Single ice crystal assays with polyproline
led to faceting, consistent with specific ice-face binding.;  This is an
exciting target, as the antifreeze glycoproteins (for which a crystal
structure does not exist) show a secondary structure similar to a
polyproline II (PPII) helix.46,47 This also suggests
that the PPII is a valuable design target, although several PPII designed
peptides failed to show IRI activity.48 In 2017, Gibson and co-workers explored how short polyprolines,49 rather than poly(hydroxyprolines) (which when
bought commercially can actually contain significant polyproline content),
could lead to activity, supporting the emerging hypothesis that hydrophobic
faces (rather than hydroxyls) engage ice in many IBPs.50 Although the oligoprolines were relatively weak
in terms of IRI (not inhibiting all ice growth even at 20 mg mL–1), they were found useful for cryopreservation.49,51 It is important to note that this is distinct from the effect of
the amino acid l-proline in cryopreservation as a protective
osmolyte.52,53 Alanine/lysine copolymers have also been
reported to show IRI activity;54,55 for biomedical applications,
the net cationic charge may lead to cytotoxicity.;  Poly(serine) has
been tested for IRI,24 but the magnitude
reported was essentially identical with a negative control of PEG.23 High molecular weight polyproline has not been
explored for IRI as it is challenging to obtain by NCA polymerizations
due to proline NCA’s unique bicyclic structure which typically
leads to slow polymerization kinetics and relatively low molecular
weight materials until copolyemerized.56,57 Recent advances
in proline NCA polymerizations now make high molecular weight polyproline
accessible.58 Lu and co-workers have reported
the water-assisted controlled ROP of ProNCA in ACN/water mixture affording
well-defined polyproline II helices.59; Considering the above, this work explores the synthesis and ice-binding
protein-mimetic activity of polyproline as a step toward identifying
biosourced and scalable ice recrystallization inhibitors.; SEC analysis of
polyproline (PPro) homopolymers was performed on an Agilent Technologies
Infinity 1260 MDS instrument equipped with differential refractive
index (DRI), light scattering (LS), and viscometry (VS) detectors.
The column set used was a PL Aquagel-OH MIXED-M column.;  Song et al. utilized a biphasic
DCM/aqueous system which was shown to produce high molecular weight
polypeptides with narrow distributions.61 Alongside this the development of ROPISA has allowed for NCA monomers
to polymerize within a basic aqueous environment to outpace the hydrolysis.62 With regard to NCA-proline the methodology reported
by Hu et al. was remarkable, using DFT calculations it was shown that
the presence of water was promoting polymerization, and hence this
method is employed here.58 In this method
acetonitrile/water mixtures are used which leads to fast kinetics
and high yields and prevents precipitation of growing polyproline
chains (Figure ​Figure11A).
It should be noted this is nonobvious due to the well-known susceptibility
of NCA’s to hydrolysis,56 but the
rapid polymerization outcompetes this side reaction.;  Therefore,
DOSY 1H NMR spectra in D2O were used to confirm
the range of molecular weights targeted was achieved as the diffusion
coefficients shifts should be universal for a given polymer independent
of standards.63 The molecular weight targeted
was plotted against diffusion coefficient measured for the polyprolines
which gave an R2 value 0.94 for the linear
fit.;  Alongside
this the CD spectra displayed a typical trace of a left-handed PPII
helix (Figure ​Figure22A).
Therefore, it was concluded that five different molecular weight polyprolines
ranging from 2000 to 50000 g mol–1 displaying the
desired PPII helix were successfully synthesized.; Solution properties of polyproline. (A) CD spectra of
PPro of varied
DP (1 mg mL–1 in PBS media). (B) Turbidimetry curves
of PPro (5 mg mL–1 in PBS). (C) Intensity-weighted
size distributions of PPro obtained from DLS. (D) Representative cryo-TEM
image of PPro50k.;  The lowest molecular weight polyproline
showed a cloud point of 80 °C, with the cloud point decreasing
as molecular weight increased to ∼65 °C for the 50 kg
mol–1 polymers.;  In fact,
for the later IRI testing, hydrophobicity is known to be crucial,
and hence this limit of solubility may be useful, as seen for facially
amphiphilic glycopolymers.26 It was recently
demonstrated that polyproline shows large hysteresis in its LCST transitions
matching the observations found here.71;  Other IRI active polymers typically show increased
activity as molecular weight increases,14,21,54 and hence it was important to explore the IRI of
the present polyproline library to determine if simply increasing
the molecular weight would lead to enhanced properties.;  It is crucial to note that saline (or other additives)
is essential to form a eutectic phase to prevent false positives,
and hence phosphate buffered saline was used ([NaCl] = 0.137 M).23Figure ​Figure33A shows a full analysis of the dose-dependent IRI of the library
of polyprolines.;  However, the materials
used here were obtained by a controlled polymerization method, but
previous reports were supplier-provided molecular weights containing
large fractions of low molecular weight material explaining this deviation.49 The higher molecular weights were more active
inhibiting growth below 5 mg mL–1, placing them
in the medium activity range of antifreeze protein mimetics (less
active than PVA or antifreeze proteins).23 It is important to also note that due to the propensity for the
polyprolines to aggregate, the similar activity seen across the panel
could be due to larger aggregates dominating the observed activity.;  It is important to note that
the IRI activity of the polyprolines here is greater than previous
reports of short oligoprolines49,51 and demonstrates that
a simple homopolypeptide can be deployed to prevent ice recrystallization.
This may offer advantages compared to all-carbon backbone polymers
in the context of making these degradable and from biosourced monomers.;  This secondary validation confirms
that polyproline has the potential to be a potent IRI agent, so long
as the Mw is sufficiently high.; Ice binding proteins (IBPs) function by binding to specific ice
crystal planes, which results in their macroscopic properties of ice
recrystallization inhibition, thermal hysteresis, and dynamic ice
shaping,2,73 as do some synthetic polymers20,21 and self-assembled structures.25 However,
the magnitude of IRI activity varies, separately from the extent of
other properties associated with ice binding23,74 and some materials can display IRI without any evidence of ice binding.75 In short, the macroscopic properties of IRI,
thermal hysteresis and dynamic ice shaping76 may be induced by different molecular level interactions.14Figure ​Figure44A shows ice crystals grown in 45% sucrose solution with polyproline,
which did not reveal significant evidence of faceting, which would
indicate specific ice crystal binding.;  Similar
morphologies are obtained for PVA which binds to the prism planes
of ice.20 This experiment confirms that
polyproline can bind to ice crystals faces.;  This
supports our hypothesis that the PPII helix adopted by polyproline
can mimic the PPII-type helix found in antifreeze glycoproteins,47 where the hydrophobic face engages the ice face,50 which is distinct from e.g. poly(vinyl alcohol)
which forms hydrogen bonds to the ice.21,22 This is particularly
important as it suggests that a simple homopolypeptide sequence is
sufficient to bind ice, although the magnitude of effect seen here
could be due to the above-discussed aggregates.; Here we report the synthesis and application
of high molecular
weight polyproline as a biomimetic ice recrystallization inhibitor
(IRI), demonstrating that potent IRI activity could potentially be
introduced into materials derived from renewable sources, as opposed
to previously reported polymeric IRIs.;  Our hypothesis is based on
the observations that antifreeze glycoproteins have a polyproline
II helix and that the amphipathic structure is a key motif for activity.
We have previously reported that oligoprolines showed weak IRI activity
limited by the molecular weight.;  High molecular weight polyprolines
were obtained here by aqueous, open to air, N-carboxyanhydride
(NCA) polymerization, enabling access to polymers with molecular weights
as high as 50000 g mol–1, which is challenging to
achieve with standard NCA polymerization of proline.;  Because of the
rigid nature of the PPII helix, a DOSY NMR method was required to
obtain molecular weights of the larger polyprolines, whereas the shorter
could be analyzed by conventional size exclusion chromatography.;  The
polyprolines were observed to show molecular weight dependent lower
critical solution temperature and potentially assembled at higher
concentrations.;  Ice recrystallization inhibition activity was assessed
using both the “splat” and “sucrose sandwich”
assays demonstrating polyproline is a potent IRI.;  The highest Mw polyproline was able to inhibit all ice growth
below 5 mg mL–1, which is significantly more active
than the previously reported proline oligomers which failed to fully
inhibit ice growth even at 20 mg mL–1.;  Single ice
crystal shaping assays showed faceting, confirming that polyproline
could bind ice crystal faces."

to obtain polyproline with molecular weights of up to 50000 g mol–1.; In the design of polymer mimics for future in vivo applications or deployment in the environment, their
fate must be
considered to prevent the accumulation of nondegradable materials.34 Ester linkages have been incorporated in poly(vinyl

A strategy to use biosourced building blocks to obtain materials that
are potentially hydrolyzable or enzymatically cleavable (depending
on the sequence) is to use poly(amino acid)s derived from N-carboxyanhydride, NCA, polymerization.37 NCAs are typically formed by the phosgenation of natural

(ROP) to yield poly(amino acid)s.;  Polyproline
was synthesized by aqueous open-air ring-opening N-carboxyanhydride polymerization, giving rise to polypeptides of

"polysarcosine","C015475",37303170,10265654," These polymers were found to have IRI activity down
to 5 mg mL–1, unlike a control peptide of polysarcosine,
which did not inhibit all ice growth at up to 40 mg mL–1.; SEC analysis of polysarcosine homopolymers was performed using
a PSS SECurity GPC system equipped with a PFG 7 μm 8 ×
50 mm precolumn, a PSS 100 Å, 7 μm 8 × 300 mm column,
and a PSS 1000 Å, 7 μm 8 × 300 mm column in series
and a differential refractive index (RI) detector at a flow rate of
1.0 mL min–1 in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol
(HFiP).;  Figure ​Figure33B shows IRI activity
for a control polypeptide of polysarcosine (also obtained by NCA polymerization;
see the Supporting Information for the
synthetic procedure, Table S1 and Figures S5–S8).;  For all molecular weights,
polysarcosine was less active, and it also highlighted a key feature
of IRI testing that any macromolecule of sufficiently high concentration
will slow ice growth and hence the importance of negative controls.23Figures ​Figures33C,D show example cryomicrographs of the polypeptides in ice
wafers highlighting the IRI activity."
"polyprolines","C011083",37303170,10265654," The polyprolines exhibited lower critical solution temperature
behavior and assembly/aggregation observed at room temperature, which
may contribute to its activity.;  This is an
exciting target, as the antifreeze glycoproteins (for which a crystal
structure does not exist) show a secondary structure similar to a
polyproline II (PPII) helix.46,47 This also suggests
that the PPII is a valuable design target, although several PPII designed
peptides failed to show IRI activity.48 In 2017, Gibson and co-workers explored how short polyprolines,49 rather than poly(hydroxyprolines) (which when
bought commercially can actually contain significant polyproline content),
could lead to activity, supporting the emerging hypothesis that hydrophobic
faces (rather than hydroxyls) engage ice in many IBPs.50 Although the oligoprolines were relatively weak
in terms of IRI (not inhibiting all ice growth even at 20 mg mL–1), they were found useful for cryopreservation.49,51 It is important to note that this is distinct from the effect of
the amino acid l-proline in cryopreservation as a protective
osmolyte.52,53 Alanine/lysine copolymers have also been
reported to show IRI activity;54,55 for biomedical applications,
the net cationic charge may lead to cytotoxicity.;  Therefore,
DOSY 1H NMR spectra in D2O were used to confirm
the range of molecular weights targeted was achieved as the diffusion
coefficients shifts should be universal for a given polymer independent
of standards.63 The molecular weight targeted
was plotted against diffusion coefficient measured for the polyprolines
which gave an R2 value 0.94 for the linear
fit.;  Alongside
this the CD spectra displayed a typical trace of a left-handed PPII
helix (Figure ​Figure22A).
Therefore, it was concluded that five different molecular weight polyprolines
ranging from 2000 to 50000 g mol–1 displaying the
desired PPII helix were successfully synthesized.;  It is crucial to note that saline (or other additives)
is essential to form a eutectic phase to prevent false positives,
and hence phosphate buffered saline was used ([NaCl] = 0.137 M).23Figure ​Figure33A shows a full analysis of the dose-dependent IRI of the library
of polyprolines.;  However, the materials
used here were obtained by a controlled polymerization method, but
previous reports were supplier-provided molecular weights containing
large fractions of low molecular weight material explaining this deviation.49 The higher molecular weights were more active
inhibiting growth below 5 mg mL–1, placing them
in the medium activity range of antifreeze protein mimetics (less
active than PVA or antifreeze proteins).23 It is important to also note that due to the propensity for the
polyprolines to aggregate, the similar activity seen across the panel
could be due to larger aggregates dominating the observed activity.;  It is important to note that
the IRI activity of the polyprolines here is greater than previous
reports of short oligoprolines49,51 and demonstrates that
a simple homopolypeptide can be deployed to prevent ice recrystallization.
This may offer advantages compared to all-carbon backbone polymers
in the context of making these degradable and from biosourced monomers.;  High molecular weight polyprolines
were obtained here by aqueous, open to air, N-carboxyanhydride
(NCA) polymerization, enabling access to polymers with molecular weights
as high as 50000 g mol–1, which is challenging to
achieve with standard NCA polymerization of proline.;  Because of the
rigid nature of the PPII helix, a DOSY NMR method was required to
obtain molecular weights of the larger polyprolines, whereas the shorter
could be analyzed by conventional size exclusion chromatography.;  The
polyprolines were observed to show molecular weight dependent lower
critical solution temperature and potentially assembled at higher
concentrations."
"vinyl","D014753",37303170,10265654," This work
shows that non-vinyl-based polymers can be designed to inhibit ice
recrystallization and may offer a more sustainable or environmentally
acceptable, while synthetically scalable, route to large-scale applications.; Ice-binding proteins are produced by many
species to control the
formation and growth of ice crystals.1,2 The ability
to recognize ice in a vast excess of water is a remarkably challenging
biological recognition achievement, and the fundamental mechanisms
of how this is achieved are under active investigation.3−5 The potential to control ice formation and growth has many applications
across frozen food,6,7 to mitigate freeze/thaw damage
in concrete,8 or to prevent ice formation
on aircraft wings or turbine blades.9,10 Ice-binding
proteins have been found to mitigate cell stress during cryopreservation
due to their ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity.11−13 For all these applications, a key challenge has been reproducing
the complex function of ice-binding proteins using synthetic platforms
that benefit from scalability and tunability, which may not be possible
with extracted or recombinant proteins.14 Polymeric mimics have emerged, with poly(vinyl alcohol), PVA, being
the most studied.15−20 PVA functions by a different molecular level mechanism than IBPs,
with hydrogen bonding from the hydroxyls to the ice face being essential.21,22 It is important to note that polyhydroxylation is not a predictor
of IRI activity, with most hydroxylated polymers showing no significant
activity.23,24 Polymers and self-assembled structures with
amphipathic structures have been reported to show IRI activity25,26 as have nanocellulose,27 self-assembling
peptides,28 and some nanoparticles.29 Ben et al. have pioneered the use of small molecules,
such as alkyl glycosides which can limit ice recrystallization30−32 and have been shown to enhance red blood cell cryopreservation.33; In the design of polymer mimics for future in vivo applications or deployment in the environment, their
fate must be
considered to prevent the accumulation of nondegradable materials.34 Ester linkages have been incorporated in poly(vinyl
alcohol) and polyampholytes through radical ring-opening polymerization35,36 but degrade to shorter polymers rather than to small molecules.
A strategy to use biosourced building blocks to obtain materials that
are potentially hydrolyzable or enzymatically cleavable (depending

or synthetic amino acids, which can undergo ring-opening polymerization
(ROP) to yield poly(amino acid)s.;  This
supports our hypothesis that the PPII helix adopted by polyproline
can mimic the PPII-type helix found in antifreeze glycoproteins,47 where the hydrophobic face engages the ice face,50 which is distinct from e.g. poly(vinyl alcohol)
which forms hydrogen bonds to the ice.21,22 This is particularly
important as it suggests that a simple homopolypeptide sequence is
sufficient to bind ice, although the magnitude of effect seen here
could be due to the above-discussed aggregates.;  The polypeptides also
have heteroatoms in their backbone and hence have potential to be
hydrolyzed, unlike other IRI active polymers such as poly(vinyl alcohol)."

Fathepure [66] explained that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are abundant in many oily and saline environments posing a high environmental risk factor due to their toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic properties.;  However, information on the ability of halophiles to treat hypersaline environments contaminated with aromatics is limited [67]. The potential of halophilic and halotolerant bacteria to degrade hydrocarbons (benzanthracene, naphthalene and diesel fuel) was profiled in this study using DCPIP as the indicator (Table 3).;  DCPIP is an electron acceptor that becomes reduced (decolorized) when redox reactions occur, in this case when NADH is converted to NAD+ during microbial degradation of hydrocarbons [68]. The isolate Salinivibrio sp.;  SP9 showed the highest hydrocarbon-degrading activity (Figure 3) against benzanthracene (70% DCPIP reduction) followed by Halobacillus alkaliphilus SP22 (35% DCPIP reduction).;  To our knowledge, this is the first report linking the Salinovibrio genus to hydrocarbon degradation activity as previous studies have only documented the biodegradation of benzanthracene by some bacteria of the genera Alcaligenes, Stenotrophomonas, Sphingomonas and Pseudomonas [69]. Interestingly, the isolate Staphylococcus sp.;  SP5 is a halotolerant which showed approximately 20% of DCPIP reduction for all three hydrocarbon classes, a finding that agrees with the observations of Mujahid et al.

Isolates Salinivibrio sp.; A modified protocol of Um et al. [84] was used to test the isolates for the capacity to degrade hydrocarbons.;  The polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) solution was evenly spread over the agar surface and evaporated to leave a visible thin white layer of PAHs on the surface of the bottom agar.; The isolates which were able show to clear halos around colonies were selected for further hydrocarbon degrading assays following the slightly modified method of Oliveira et al. [85]. The positive isolates were grown in fermentation broth containing minimal salt medium supplemented with glucose (10 g/L) and yeast extract (1.0 g/L) and incubated at 25 °C for 72 h with shaking at 120 rpm.;  Each well contained 20 µL of the isolate, 168 µL of minimal salt medium, 12 µL of DCPIP and 2 µL of hydrocarbon (naphthalene, benzanthracene and diesel) in turn.;  Culture dependent assays showed the potential of some halophiles to biodegrade hydrocarbons, making them potentially important agents for the bioremediation of hydrocarbon polluted sites."

(G) 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC).; The lipids shown in Fig. 1, A–D, were synthesized as shown in the Supporting Material (Sections S3 and S4).; We formed a homogeneous lipid film on the bottom of a 10 mL round-bottom flask via gentle rotary evaporation of a 1 mL solution of lipid in chloroform (10 mM for lipids with one headgroup and 5 mM for bipolar lipids).; Liposomes composed of T28 and T36 were prepared by adding 10 μL of each lipid (10 mg/mL in an 80:20 chloroform/methanol solution) to round-bottom flasks and removing the solvent by rotary evaporation; the lipid films were dried under high vacuum for ∼1 h.;  An aqueous solution of 150 mM KCl and 10 mM HEPES at pH 7 was added to resuspend the lipids to a final lipid concentration of 0.1 mg/mL.;  The solutions containing lipids were sonicated for 5 min to form liposome suspensions.;  Nanoscope software was used for depth analysis to estimate the height of the lipid membranes.; The structural models for the archaea lipids were constructed and minimized using Maestro (Schrödinger LLC, New York, NY).;  The modeled lipids all had an all-trans conformation along the hydrocarbon chain.;  The single lipid was then translated and rotated along the x and y directions to build a smaller model membrane system comprising 81 lipids.;  Upon running equilibration simulations (50 ns) on this smaller membrane model, the equilibrated small membrane model was replicated in the x and y axes to build a bigger membrane model of 729 total lipids (1458 in the case of U16).;  Visual molecular dynamics (VMD) (31) was used to make the translations and rotations of lipid in building the membrane.;  For POPC, we used the built-in membrane tool in VMD and produced a membrane of 1458 total lipids to match the sizes of the other systems.;  The CHARMM36 lipid force field was used with a 10 Å cut-off for van der Waals with an 8.5 Å switching distance, and particle-mesh Ewald for long-range electrostatics.;  The entropy of the individual lipids was determined using the Schlitter formula SkB/2ln det[I +Â (kTe2/Ä§2)MÏƒ] (34) where Mσ is the mass-weighted covariance matrix calculated from the simulations.;  However, Eq. 3 must be modified to describe protons in buffered systems (36), as protons on both sides of the membrane exist in chemical equilibrium with the protonated forms of buffering agents, fluorescent pH indicators, and lipid headgroups.;  Additionally, prior reports assumed linear buffering as pH changes (8, 19, 24) (often neglecting the buffering effects of lipid phosphate headgroups (36)) and made assumptions about fluorescent response to pH (19) and permeation mechanism (24) based on the fact that a single exponential function does not suffice to fit fluorescence decay curves well.;  The permeability values we obtained for membranes from POPC and DiPhyPC lipids (Table 1) are in reasonable agreement with some literature values reported for POPC, PH+/OH− = 7 × 10−5 cm/s (23), and for DiPhyPC, PH+/OH− = 4.0 × 10−6 cm/s (40) and 7.0 × 10−6 cm/s (41).; We explored the effect of transmembrane tethering, tether length, and the presence of isoprenoid methyl groups on one or both lipid tails on the PH+/OH− values through liposomes formed from a series of synthetic lipids with small systematic structural variations.;  The lipid U16 (Fig. 1
D) is untethered and has a 16-carbon straight chain attached to the headgroup in place of the tether; it is structurally equivalent to half of T32.;  The commercially available lipid Di-O-PhyPC (Fig. 1
E) differs from U16 only insofar as it has two phytanyl chains instead of one phytanyl and one n-alkane acyl chain.;  Fig. 4 compares H+/OH− permeability values for tethered and untethered archaea-inspired lipids alongside those gathered for POPC (Fig. 1
G).; Box-and-whisker plots showing PH+/OH− values gathered from seven different lipids.; The PH+/OH− permeability results from the lipids T28, T32, and T36 indicate that liposome membranes become more permeable to protons as tether length increases if the length of the untethered acyl chain is kept constant (Table 1).;  A Tukey honest significant difference test comparing the log-transformed PH+/OH− values of these three lipids found the mean H+/OH− permeability of liposomes composed of T28 lipids to be significantly smaller (p = 0.01) than that of T36 liposomes.; In an attempt to gain insight into the molecular differences that may affect proton permeability through membranes, we conducted MD simulations of membranes composed of each lipid (except Di-O-PhyPC) to measure structural parameters such as membrane thickness, area per lipid, lateral diffusion coefficients, conformational entropy, and bending rigidity.;  Table 1 shows the results from MD simulations for these lipids; they agree well with experimentally measured values.;  For instance, the lateral diffusion coefficients D2 determined by MD simulations were strongly correlated with lateral diffusion coefficients (DL) measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments on supported lipid bilayers of the same six lipids (Table 1, Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.95 with p = 0.004).;  Additionally, the thicknesses of T28 and T32 membranes as measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) were 0.5 to 0.6 nm larger than those determined by MD, which falls within the literature range for the thickness of the expected water layer between lipids and the underlying mica substrate used for AFM measurements (0.4–1.7 nm) (Fig. S1) (48, 49).;  Further, the area-per-lipid values obtained from MD for POPC and DiPhyPC are within 3% of literature values obtained by Kučerka et al. from small-angle x-ray and neutron scattering (52).; The experimentally measured H+/OH− permeability in monolayers of tethered lipids increased with increasing tether length (T28, T32, and T36).;  The results from MD simulations, reported in Table 1, reveal that membrane stiffness decreases and lipid entropy increases with increasing lipid tether length, as well.;  In the tethered lipids, the two untethered phytanyl chains have a combined length of 32 methylene groups—four carbons longer than the T28 tether and four carbons shorter than the T36 tether; the differences in PH+/OH− may be attributable to increased hydrocarbon crowding in T28 and the presence of a “gap” in T36.;  Therefore, the observed reduction in proton permeability in the sequence of membranes from T36 lipids to T32 lipids to T28 lipids could be a result of the increasing crowding, order, and stiffness of the hydrophobic region of the membranes.;  Defining a penetration event as an instance when a water molecule moves past the ether or ester oxygen of the nearest lipid into the hydrophobic region, we found penetration frequencies of 8 × 10−3 to 1.6 × 10−2 nm−2 ns−1.;  Quantifying the entry of water molecules into the hydrophobic core in all six simulated membranes (including three untethered lipids, Table 2) revealed that log PH+/OH− correlated with the total number of water molecules that spontaneously entered the membrane over 50 ns (Pearson coefficient, r = 0.86; p = 0.027).; Water within the hydrophobic region is predictive of log PH+/OH−. (A) Correlation plot of log PH+/OH− as a function of the number of times at least three water molecules simultaneously occupied the hydrophobic region anywhere in the lipid membrane over the course of a 50 ns MD simulation.;  The solid line is the best fit to a straight line; dotted lines show the 95% confidence interval from the fit. (B) Correlation plot of log PH+/OH− as a function of the number of times a water cluster appeared in the hydrophobic region of the lipid membrane over the course of a 50 ns MD simulation.;  The Pearson coefficient is r = 0.88. (C) A snapshot from the MD simulation of a membrane from T28 lipids, showing the penetration of water molecules into the hydrophobic core of the membrane.; Although we would not expect the distribution of water molecules to be uniform throughout the volume of the hydrophobic core of the lipid membrane (the probability should fall off with increasing distance from the headgroup into the core (60)), it should be roughly uniform across the surface area of the membrane.;  Thus, the probability of finding two water molecules in the vicinity of the same lipid headgroup would be inversely proportional to the number of headgroups, which for all of our simulated membranes would be 1/1458 or ∼0.07%. If we take the T28 membrane as an example, we find 59 instances of 2 or more water molecules anywhere in the membrane in our simulations (data taken at 0.1 ns intervals over 50 ns, i.e., 500 observations); this value approximates the expected value of 63.3 from the corresponding best-fit Poisson distribution.;  We caution, however, that although the likelihood that this correlation was a result of random chance is very low, this relationship will have to be tested with additional lipids, given the large uncertainty in the measured proton permeabilities and the limited number of six data pairs in the correlation analysis.;  We are currently trying to expand the number of tested lipids, however, the synthesis of archaea-inspired lipids is extremely work intensive, and MD simulations are time intensive, requiring a separate follow-up study.;  To observe the effects of tethering, we compared PH+/OH− values from membranes composed of U16 and T32, since T32’s structure is identical to two U16 lipids bonded together at the terminal carbons of their unbranched chains (Fig. 1, B and D).;  Komatsu and Chong found that the H+/OH− permeability of doubly tethered lipids isolated from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius was relatively invariant with respect to temperature from 25 to 80°C, whereas PH+/OH− values from standard (untethered) eggPC lipids increased dramatically with increasing temperature.; Based on a two-tailed Student’s t-test comparing log-transformed PH+/OH− values, the mean permeability of liposomes from Di-O-PhyPC lipids was lower (p = 0.059) than that from U16 lipids (Table 1).;  Given that U16 and Di-O-PhyPC only differ structurally by the presence or absence of isoprenoid methyl groups on one lipid tail, this result agrees with previous findings that this motif lowers H+/OH− permeability (8).;  Most lipids characteristic of acidophilic archaea display the isoprenoid methyl motif on both acyl chains (1).; Despite strong efforts to optimize the permeability assay, we were unable to eliminate variability between measured H+/OH− permeability values of membranes composed of the same lipid.; We have optimized a fluorescence-based H+/OH− permeability assay by introducing a fitting formula that describes the entire kinetics of a step ΔpH-induced change of the interior pH of liposomes and by establishing an appropriate concentration of valinomycin (10 nM) to investigate permeability values in homogeneous lipid membranes containing synthetic archaea-inspired lipids.;  The lipid T32, which was tethered by a straight 32-carbon chain, produced membranes with PH+/OH− values similar to those of membranes composed of its untethered equivalent, U16, revealing that tethering does not affect PH+/OH− at room temperature.;  However, PH+/OH− values among tethered lipid membranes increased with increasing tether length if the number of carbons in the untethered acyl tail was constant.;  Further, monopolar lipids with two tails containing isoprenoid methyl branches form membranes with lower H+/OH− permeability than those with one branching tail and one unbranched tail.;  In addition, MD simulations carried out in this work suggest that the penetration of water into the hydrophobic core of lipid membranes predicts their proton permeability.;  These results inform the design of synthetic bipolar lipid molecules for desired H+/OH− permeability characteristics.;  G.L. and T.K. synthesized the lipids.;  J.Y. designed the lipid synthesis."
"valinomycin","D014634",27276261,4906265," All permeability assays were performed in the presence of a low concentration of valinomycin (10 nM) to prevent buildup of a membrane potential without artificially increasing the measured PH+/OH−. Surprisingly, the presence of a transmembrane tether did not impact PH+/OH− at room temperature.;  We have also determined a concentration range in which the ionophore valinomycin is selective for K+ over H+ to eliminate the membrane potential that would arise from imposing a concentration gradient on a system with a single mobile ion while minimizing possible artifacts in the measured H+/OH− permeability due to valinomycin-induced proton flux.;  We transferred a 1 mL fraction containing liposomes to a cuvette, then added 1 μL of a solution of valinomycin (10 μM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)) to reach a final concentration of 10 nM and mixed by gentle pipetting.; We performed all experiments in the presence of potassium ions and the K+ ionophore valinomycin in solution to prevent the buildup of a membrane potential that would likely reduce the measured H+/OH− flux (19).;  Previous work indicates that at high valinomycin concentrations beginning at ∼100 nM, membrane H+/OH− permeability increases sharply with increasing valinomycin concentration (16, 42, 43, 44).;  At these elevated concentrations, valinomycin is therefore thought to display protonophoric activity in addition to ferrying K+ ions (42, 43, 45); in 2006, Kříž et al. provided NMR evidence for the existence of an H3O+-carrying valinomycin complex, reinforcing this conclusion (46, 47).;  We decided to experimentally establish an appropriate valinomycin concentration for the system by measuring the H+/OH− permeability of POPC vesicles at different valinomycin concentrations.;  Our goal was to find a range in which liposomes would exhibit PH+/OH− values higher than in the absence of valinomycin, indicating that the buildup of a membrane potential accompanying H+ diffusion was being successfully prevented via K+ diffusion, but in which PH+/OH− was independent of the valinomycin concentration, since a positive dependence would indicate protonophoric activity.;  As valinomycin is poorly soluble in water, we added it to liposome solutions via concentrated aliquots in DMSO; the resulting plot of PH+/OH− versus valinomycin concentration is shown in Fig. 3.;  The H+/OH− permeability increased from the baseline value after the addition of just 10 fM valinomycin and plateaued with increasing valinomycin concentrations until a point of inflection was reached around 100 nM, at which point PH+/OH− began to increase dramatically in the presence of more valinomycin.;  We selected a valinomycin concentration of 10 nM for all subsequent experiments.;  After the axis break, the final concentration of valinomycin indicated on the x axis was added in 2.66 μL DMSO to a total volume of 1 mL.;  Red squares within the area shaded in gray represent data within the “plateau” range of valinomycin concentrations.; We have optimized a fluorescence-based H+/OH− permeability assay by introducing a fitting formula that describes the entire kinetics of a step ΔpH-induced change of the interior pH of liposomes and by establishing an appropriate concentration of valinomycin (10 nM) to investigate permeability values in homogeneous lipid membranes containing synthetic archaea-inspired lipids."

And third, how does the PH+/OH− of an untethered lipid with a repeating isoprenoid methyl motif on one of its tails compare to that of a lipid with the methyl groups on both tails?; The lipids shown in Fig. 1, A–D, were synthesized as shown in the Supporting Material (Sections S3 and S4).; We formed a homogeneous lipid film on the bottom of a 10 mL round-bottom flask via gentle rotary evaporation of a 1 mL solution of lipid in chloroform (10 mM for lipids with one headgroup and 5 mM for bipolar lipids).;  An aqueous solution of 150 mM KCl and 10 mM HEPES at pH 7 was added to resuspend the lipids to a final lipid concentration of 0.1 mg/mL.;  The solutions containing lipids were sonicated for 5 min to form liposome suspensions.; The structural models for the archaea lipids were constructed and minimized using Maestro (Schrödinger LLC, New York, NY).;  The modeled lipids all had an all-trans conformation along the hydrocarbon chain.;  The single lipid was then translated and rotated along the x and y directions to build a smaller model membrane system comprising 81 lipids.;  Upon running equilibration simulations (50 ns) on this smaller membrane model, the equilibrated small membrane model was replicated in the x and y axes to build a bigger membrane model of 729 total lipids (1458 in the case of U16).;  For POPC, we used the built-in membrane tool in VMD and produced a membrane of 1458 total lipids to match the sizes of the other systems.;  The entropy of the individual lipids was determined using the Schlitter formula SkB/2ln det[I +Â (kTe2/Ä§2)MÏƒ] (34) where Mσ is the mass-weighted covariance matrix calculated from the simulations.;  The permeability values we obtained for membranes from POPC and DiPhyPC lipids (Table 1) are in reasonable agreement with some literature values reported for POPC, PH+/OH− = 7 × 10−5 cm/s (23), and for DiPhyPC, PH+/OH− = 4.0 × 10−6 cm/s (40) and 7.0 × 10−6 cm/s (41).; We explored the effect of transmembrane tethering, tether length, and the presence of isoprenoid methyl groups on one or both lipid tails on the PH+/OH− values through liposomes formed from a series of synthetic lipids with small systematic structural variations.;  Fig. 4 compares H+/OH− permeability values for tethered and untethered archaea-inspired lipids alongside those gathered for POPC (Fig. 1
G).; Box-and-whisker plots showing PH+/OH− values gathered from seven different lipids.; The PH+/OH− permeability results from the lipids T28, T32, and T36 indicate that liposome membranes become more permeable to protons as tether length increases if the length of the untethered acyl chain is kept constant (Table 1).;  A Tukey honest significant difference test comparing the log-transformed PH+/OH− values of these three lipids found the mean H+/OH− permeability of liposomes composed of T28 lipids to be significantly smaller (p = 0.01) than that of T36 liposomes.;  Table 1 shows the results from MD simulations for these lipids; they agree well with experimentally measured values.;  For instance, the lateral diffusion coefficients D2 determined by MD simulations were strongly correlated with lateral diffusion coefficients (DL) measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments on supported lipid bilayers of the same six lipids (Table 1, Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.95 with p = 0.004).;  Additionally, the thicknesses of T28 and T32 membranes as measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) were 0.5 to 0.6 nm larger than those determined by MD, which falls within the literature range for the thickness of the expected water layer between lipids and the underlying mica substrate used for AFM measurements (0.4–1.7 nm) (Fig. S1) (48, 49).; The experimentally measured H+/OH− permeability in monolayers of tethered lipids increased with increasing tether length (T28, T32, and T36).;  In the tethered lipids, the two untethered phytanyl chains have a combined length of 32 methylene groups—four carbons longer than the T28 tether and four carbons shorter than the T36 tether; the differences in PH+/OH− may be attributable to increased hydrocarbon crowding in T28 and the presence of a “gap” in T36.;  Therefore, the observed reduction in proton permeability in the sequence of membranes from T36 lipids to T32 lipids to T28 lipids could be a result of the increasing crowding, order, and stiffness of the hydrophobic region of the membranes.;  Quantifying the entry of water molecules into the hydrophobic core in all six simulated membranes (including three untethered lipids, Table 2) revealed that log PH+/OH− correlated with the total number of water molecules that spontaneously entered the membrane over 50 ns (Pearson coefficient, r = 0.86; p = 0.027).;  The Pearson coefficient is r = 0.88.

"isoprenoid","D013729",27276261,4906265," A fluorescence-based permeability assay was optimized to determine the effects on the PH+/OH− through liposome membranes with variations in the following lipid attributes: transmembrane tethering, tether length, and the presence of isoprenoid methyl groups on one or both lipid tails.;  Untethered lipids with two isoprenoid methyl tails led to lower PH+/OH− values than lipids with only one or no isoprenoid tails.;  Archaeal lipid tails often contain methyl branches in a repeating isoprenoid pattern, as well as cyclopentane and cyclohexane rings.; To make this study possible, we synthesized a series of extremophile-inspired lipids composed of two glycerophosphocholine heads connected by a membrane-spanning n-alkyl tether with each head ether-bonded to a phytanyl chain (T28, T32, and T36 (Fig. 1, A–C)), as well as several untethered lipids (U16, 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Di-O-PhyPC), 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DiPhyPC), and POPC (Fig. 1, D–G)) to seek answers to our questions about structure-permeability relationships of liposomes from pure lipid preparations at room temperature: First, how does the presence of a single tether between two lipid headgroups affect PH+/OH− compared to the absence of a tether? Second, how does the length of the tether affect H+/OH− permeability when the lengths of the untethered phytanyl chains are kept constant at 16 carbons? And third, how does the PH+/OH− of an untethered lipid with a repeating isoprenoid methyl motif on one of its tails compare to that of a lipid with the methyl groups on both tails?; We explored the effect of transmembrane tethering, tether length, and the presence of isoprenoid methyl groups on one or both lipid tails on the PH+/OH− values through liposomes formed from a series of synthetic lipids with small systematic structural variations.;  Given that U16 and Di-O-PhyPC only differ structurally by the presence or absence of isoprenoid methyl groups on one lipid tail, this result agrees with previous findings that this motif lowers H+/OH− permeability (8).;  Most lipids characteristic of acidophilic archaea display the isoprenoid methyl motif on both acyl chains (1).;  Further, monopolar lipids with two tails containing isoprenoid methyl branches form membranes with lower H+/OH− permeability than those with one branching tail and one unbranched tail."
"water","D014867",27276261,4906265," Molecular dynamics simulations revealed a strong positive correlation between the probability of observing water molecules in the hydrophobic core of these lipid membranes and their proton permeability.;  We propose that water penetration as revealed by molecular dynamics may provide a general strategy for predicting proton permeability through various lipid membranes without the need for experimentation.;  These lipids usually contain ether bonds connecting the head glycerol group to the tails, increasing their chemical stability and potentially inhibiting the formation of transient hydrogen-bonded water chains compared to the ester bonds in standard phospholipids (8).;  The proposed modes of H+/OH− flux that have historically received the most attention tend to rely on the ability of protons to “hop” between hydrogen-bonded water molecules, an idea first described by de Grotthuss in 1805 (14).;  Despite this long history, the specifics of this mechanism are still being resolved (15), but most membrane H+/OH− permeation models propose the formation of short-lived clusters or wires of water across the membrane (16, 17, 18).;  In 2010, Nichols and Abercrombie proposed a five-step “transmembrane condensation model” in which a proton and a hydroxide anion spontaneously appear on either side of a membrane and interact electrostatically across the membrane; in rare cases, one species or the other overcomes its Born energy barrier and penetrates into the hydrophobic core, likely in the form of a cluster of water molecules (rendering it potentially consistent with the transient water wire hypothesis) (20).;  We hydrated the film with 1 mL of a buffered aqueous solution containing 50 μM pyranine, 50 mM K2SO4, 10 mM N-(2-acetamido)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, 10 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, 10 mM N-[Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, and 10 mM tricine, pH 7.25, and heated the flask to 37°C in a water bath for ≥3 h.;  After transferring the resulting solution of liposomes to an Eppendorf tube, we performed 15 freeze-thaw cycles in which we alternated between flash-freezing the solution in liquid nitrogen for 30 s and thawing it in a water bath at 45°C for 3 min.;  The suspension was then incubated in a water bath at 50°C for 30 min.;  All the simulations were carried out using NAMD (32) in explicit water using TIP3P water models.; To identify water in the core of the membrane, we chose to look for water molecules that penetrated past the ether or ester oxygens of the headgroups and into the carbon-rich region.;  The distributions of water numbers were all consistent with a Poisson process with p-values between 0.26 and 1 from a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (500 data points each).;  The mean water per snapshot and its standard error were determined by maximum-likelihood expectation fit of the observed distribution to a Poisson distribution, again using R.;  Water clusters were defined as groups of two or more water molecules within the hydrophobic core that were within 5 Å of each other.;  As valinomycin is poorly soluble in water, we added it to liposome solutions via concentrated aliquots in DMSO; the resulting plot of PH+/OH− versus valinomycin concentration is shown in Fig. 3.;  Additionally, the thicknesses of T28 and T32 membranes as measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) were 0.5 to 0.6 nm larger than those determined by MD, which falls within the literature range for the thickness of the expected water layer between lipids and the underlying mica substrate used for AFM measurements (0.4–1.7 nm) (Fig. S1) (48, 49).;  Previous studies that compared bilayer thickness defined by AFM for POPC and DiPhyPC with the MD data also reported water layer thicknesses in this range (Table 1) (50, 51).; MD simulations also reveal that despite the hydrophobic nature of the membrane core, water molecules regularly enter this region, as found previously in the literature (55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60) (see Fig. S2).;  Defining a penetration event as an instance when a water molecule moves past the ether or ester oxygen of the nearest lipid into the hydrophobic region, we found penetration frequencies of 8 × 10−3 to 1.6 × 10−2 nm−2 ns−1.;  These values are similar to the water penetration frequencies reported by Krylov et al. from MD simulations of DOPS, DPPC, and DOPC membranes, which ranged from 3.5 × 10−3 to 4.3 × 10−2 nm−2 ns−1 (60). (We note that this discussion is limited to the penetration of water molecules into the hydrophobic region of the membrane rather than water permeation all the way through the bilayer.) The number of water molecules is consistent with a Poisson process, implying that the entry of a given water molecule is independent from that of other water molecules.;  Quantifying the entry of water molecules into the hydrophobic core in all six simulated membranes (including three untethered lipids, Table 2) revealed that log PH+/OH− correlated with the total number of water molecules that spontaneously entered the membrane over 50 ns (Pearson coefficient, r = 0.86; p = 0.027).;  A better correlation was found between log PH+/OH− and the number of observations with at least three water molecules residing anywhere in the hydrophobic core of the membrane (Pearson coefficient, r = 0.99; p = 0.0003; Fig. 5
A).; Water within the hydrophobic region is predictive of log PH+/OH−. (A) Correlation plot of log PH+/OH− as a function of the number of times at least three water molecules simultaneously occupied the hydrophobic region anywhere in the lipid membrane over the course of a 50 ns MD simulation.;  The solid line is the best fit to a straight line; dotted lines show the 95% confidence interval from the fit. (B) Correlation plot of log PH+/OH− as a function of the number of times a water cluster appeared in the hydrophobic region of the lipid membrane over the course of a 50 ns MD simulation.;  The Pearson coefficient is r = 0.88. (C) A snapshot from the MD simulation of a membrane from T28 lipids, showing the penetration of water molecules into the hydrophobic core of the membrane.;  Water molecules are shown as van der Waals spheres and the solvent-accessible surface area around the waters in the membrane core is shown in blue.; Although we would not expect the distribution of water molecules to be uniform throughout the volume of the hydrophobic core of the lipid membrane (the probability should fall off with increasing distance from the headgroup into the core (60)), it should be roughly uniform across the surface area of the membrane.;  Thus, the probability of finding two water molecules in the vicinity of the same lipid headgroup would be inversely proportional to the number of headgroups, which for all of our simulated membranes would be 1/1458 or ∼0.07%. If we take the T28 membrane as an example, we find 59 instances of 2 or more water molecules anywhere in the membrane in our simulations (data taken at 0.1 ns intervals over 50 ns, i.e., 500 observations); this value approximates the expected value of 63.3 from the corresponding best-fit Poisson distribution.;  Interestingly, in 17 of these 59 instances, water molecules were located within 5 Å of each other; we define this condition as a water cluster.;  This observed clustering probability of 28% is well above the expected 0.07%, leading us to conclude that although water molecules appear to enter the hydrophobic core independently, they have a strong tendency to cluster after entry.;  As shown in Fig. 5
B, the number of observed water clusters also correlates well (Pearson coefficient, r = 0.88; p = 0.022) with the measured proton permeability; this observation is consistent with prior observations in the literature (18, 39, 54, 61).; Indeed, the formation of water chains or clusters is thought to be a primary mechanism for proton shuttling across the membrane (53), and although our simulations were not long enough to capture water chains that span the entire membrane thickness, we do see the formation of nascent clusters with multiple water molecules (Fig. 5
C).;  Previous MD simulations made similar observations and ultimately concluded that the clustering of water molecules is relevant for the permeation of protons but not water and that the presence of phytanyl groups would serve to disrupt water clusters and decrease proton permeability (54).;  Experimental studies using FTIR spectrometry similarly found that the formation of water clusters within the membrane depended strongly on the acyl chain composition (62).;  Taken together, these results support the idea that water entry and clustering in the hydrophobic core are both relevant metrics for proton permeation.;  In addition, MD simulations carried out in this work suggest that the penetration of water into the hydrophobic core of lipid membranes predicts their proton permeability."

The lacustrine ecosystem of Lake Sayram has been intensely investigated.;  In the lake water, the genera Acinetobacter and Ilumatobacter held an absolute predominance, implying their metabolic significance.; Lake Sayram is a cold water lake locating at a mountain basin in Xinjiang, China, with an average altitude of 2071.9 m and an average annual atmospheric temperature of 0.5°C (Wang and Dou 1998).;  The lake water is mainly fed by rain water, snow water and underground water (Ma et al. 2003).;  In 1980s, some cold water fishes were introduced and from then on fishery industry has been developed (Guo et al. 2003).;  The lake is oligotrophic according to physicochemical parameters of the lake water (Guo et al. 2003).;  Physicochemical parameters of the lake water and sediments were examined as well.;  For Sites 1, 3, 5, and 6, lake water at the surface and the bottom layers was collected in equal volume and pooled to roughly represent the whole water column at individual site.;  Five liters of the surface water (1 m below the surface) and 5 L of the bottom water (1 m above the bottom) were collected and mixed (total volume was 10 L).;  For Site 4 which was located at the lake center, water from the surface, the bottom, and two middle layers was collected for mixing.;  Five liters of water at different depths (1 m, 20 m, 40 m below the surface, and 1 m above the bottom) were collected and mixed (total volume was 20 L).;  It should be noted that inclusion of the middle layered water samples would affect the structure of the bacterial communities investigated.;  In total, five water samples were collected for subsequent planktonic microorganisms collection as well as physicochemical parameters assay.; Lat, latitude; Long, longitude; DO, dissolved oxygen; W, water; S, sediment; Sur, surface layer; Bot, bottom layer; Mid, middle layer.; To collect planktonic microorganisms, five liters of the mixed water at different sites was prefiltered using 1.6 μm pore-size GF/A filter paper (Whatman®, UK) and then the filtrate was filtered through a 0.22 μm pore-size filter membrane (Whatman®, NJ, USA).; To collect planktonic photosynthetic microorganisms, 5 L of the mixed water at various sites was filtered through a 0.45 μm pore-size filter membrane.;  For sites 1, 4, 5, and 6, sediment samples were collected from the lake bottom in parallel with water sampling.;  For lake water samples, salinity, concentrations of DO (dissolved oxygen), temperature, and pH were measured in situ using a YSI 6600 multifunction water quality monitoring instrument (Fondriest Environmental, OH, USA).; Total DNA from the water samples was extracted using the E.Z.N.A.® Water DNA Kit (OMEGA bio-tek, Norcross, GA, USA) and total DNA from the sediment samples was isolated using the E.Z.N.A.® Soil DNA Kit (OMEGA bio-tek, Norcross, GA, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions.; Towards a comprehensive investigation of the bacterial diversity in Lake Sayram, six independent sites were selected for water and sediment sampling in July 2014 (Fig.​(Fig.1).1).;  Site 1 was located in the northeast of the lake, which was near the influx of spring water.;  For Sites 1, 4, 5, and 6, both water and sediments were sampled.;  For Site 3, only water sample was taken.; Physicochemical parameters of the lake water examined on site are listed in Table​Table1.1.;  The lake water was brackish, alkaline, cold, oxidized, and clear.;  Temperatures of the lake water decreased with the increasing water depths.;  The lake water was abundant in DO and the concentrations of DO ([DO]) were negatively correlated with water temperatures. [DO] at the surface layer was between 7.29 and 8.05 mg/L, whereas [DO] at the bottom layer was between 8.71 and 10.04 mg/L.;  Transparency of the lake water was 10 m at Site 4 (the lake center), 9 m at Site 1, 6 m at Sites 2, 3, and 6, and 4 m at Site 5, respectively.; Other chemical parameters (COD, nutrient salts, Chl a, anions, cations) of the lake water are shown in Table​Table2.2.;  The lake water was clean, NO3− type, phosphorus-limited and abundant in SO42−, Cl−, and Mg2+. The average CODCr (COD) was lower than 1 mg/L.;  Phosphorus was therefore the limiting factor of the primary productivity in the lake water.;  In another word, the clearer the lake water was, the more light could penetrate and the more photosynthetic microorganisms could grow.;  Mg2+ was an abundant cation in the lake water, with a concentration ranging from 0.36 to 0.38 g/L across all the sampling sites.; Chemical parameters of the lake water; To sum up, the water in Lake Sayram was unpolluted and most of the physicochemical parameters of the lake water met the requirements of Grade 1 of the Chinese National Standards – the Environmental Quality Grading Standards for Surface Water (GB 3838 – 88).; Metagenomics based on the 16S rRNA gene was performed to investigate the structure of microbial communities in the lake water and the bottom sediments.;  For the water samples, 14 phyla, 23 classes, 35 orders, 69 families, and 134 genera of bacteria (or prokaryotes) were recovered, whereas for the sediment samples, 25 phyla, 57 classes, 71 orders, 158 families, and 413 genera of bacteria were retrieved (Table​(Table44).; Number of bacterial taxonomic units recovered from the water and sediment samples;  Those identified genera recovered from the lake water samples were widespread in the environment.;  Although Lake Sayram was a closed lake locating at a mountain basin, its lake water kept active material exchanging and energy transformation with the environment through atmospheric circulation, rain water precipitation, etc.;  Consequently, the lake water became an open system and its bacterial communities were determined by the environment.;  As the taxa occupying bigger proportion in bacterial communities are correlated to the metabolic properties (Debroas et al. 2009), Actinobacter and Ilumatobacter might play a vital role in the metabolism of the lake water.;  Species of the Actinobacter genus were widely distributed in the environment, including soil, water, and sewage (Ventura et al. 2007; Servin et al. 2008; Ghai et al. 2011).; The planktonic bacterial communities were largely structured by the physicochemical parameters of the lake water and inoculation of microbes from the water supply, which was in agreement with previous findings in other lakes (Humayoun et al. 2003; Jiang et al. 2006; Crump et al. 2012; Santofimia et al. 2013; Pjevac et al. 2015).;  Many genera of psychrophilic/psychrotolerant bacteria recovered from the water samples were reported to inhabit in polar regions, which could be due to the input of snow water and cold spring water.;  Among the five sampling sites, the genera Cryobacterium and Agrococcus were found to be most abundant at Site 1, which was closest to the entrance of cold spring water.; The lake water also accommodated bacteria with considerable adaptability.; GPIIa, Porphyrobacter, and Methylophilus appeared to contribute to the prokaryotic primary productivity of the lake water.;  Another possible photoautotrophic genus universally detected in the lake water samples was Porphyrobacter.;  Species of this genus inhabited in aquatic environments, such as fresh water, sea water, and hot spring (Fuerst et al. 1993; Rainey et al. 2003; Yoon et al. 2006; Furuhata et al. 2013).; It was noteworthy that Thioprofundum, Thiobacter, and Aciditerrimonas, the predominant bacterial genera universally detected in the sediments of this alkaline cold water lake, were thermophilic or thermoacidophilic extremophiles (Hirayama et al. 2005; Itoh et al. 2011; Mori et al. 2011), implying that there might be thermal springs at the lake bottom.;  Similar with the Methylophilus genus detected in lake water, Methyloversatilis, another facultatively methylotroph, was recovered from the sediments (Kalyuzhnaya et al. 2006).;  Profiles of the bacterial communities in this ancient cold water lake are related to its hydrological and physicochemical properties."

"water","D014867",28045976,5207672,"This study describes, for the first time, the water chemistry and microbial diversity in Dziani Dzaha, a tropical crater lake located on Mayotte Island (Comoros archipelago, Western Indian Ocean).;  The lake water had a high level of dissolved matter and high alkalinity (10.6–14.5 g L-1 eq.;  CO32-, i.e. 160–220 mM compare to around 2–2.5 in seawater), with salinity up to 52 psu, 1.5 higher than seawater.;  Hierarchical clustering discriminated Dziani Dzaha water from other alkaline, saline lakes, highlighting its thalassohaline nature.;  Throughout the whole water column the photosynthetic biomass was dominated (>97% of total biovolume) by the filamentous cyanobacteria Arthrospira sp. with a straight morphotype.;  Heterotrophic bacterioplankton was extremely abundant, with cell densities up to 1.5 108 cells mL-1 in the whole water column.;  The water chemistry of Dziani Dzaha Lake supports the hypothesis that it was derived from seawater and strongly modified by geological conditions and microbial activities that increased the alkalinity.; Saline inland waters often provide model ecosystems for studying microbial ecology, addressing numerous fundamental questions ranging from microbial diversity to the limits of life in extreme environments [1, 2]. Most saline lakes are endorheic inland water bodies and, as the dissolved mineral composition originates from the evaporation of continental water, are classified as athalassohaline environments [3], from the ancient Greek Θάλασσα (ocean) and άλας (salt), with the α-privative prefix a- (not).;  Such environments are found throughout the world, for example, in the Africa Rift Valley, in Central Asia, in the North American Desert, on the Andean Plateau and in Southern Australia [4]. However, few studies have been carried out into continental thalassohaline systems, where water is allegedly of marine origin and which are mainly found in coastal lagoons, salterns and permanently landlocked systems with hardly any exchange with the sea.; In freshwaters, very high microbial densities and metabolic rates are usually transient and linked to bloom events, occasionally related to nutrient inputs [12, 13], whereas saline and alkaline lakes have permanently high biomass and production rates [11, 14, 15]. Saline and alkaline lakes are, therefore, considered to be among the most productive aquatic systems on Earth [16]. For example, the saline lakes in the Rift Valley harbor high biomasses of cyanobacteria belonging to the genus Arthrospira, with a transient dominance of diatoms or chlorophytes (e.g.; Dziani Dzaha Lake (Mayotte, Western Indian Ocean) has permanent green salty water, with occasional gas bubbling, stromatolites on the lake shore, a complete absence of large organisms and is close (0.1 km) to the Indian Ocean, making this lake a very interesting environment for aquatic microbial ecology studies.;  A chemical analysis was undertaken to determine whether the origin of the lake water was athalassohaline or thalassohaline and the results were compared with those from other inland saline aquatic systems.; Field permit was granted by: Conservatoire du Littoral et des Rivages Lacustres, Antenne Océan Indien, since Dziani Dzaha is currently a protected water body with free public access but restricted activities, under the control of the French agency for littoral ecosystems conservation (http://www.conservatoire-du-littoral.fr/).;  The lake waters have always been dark green so far as local inhabitants remember.;  Picture took in October, 2014, in dry season at low water level.;  A miniature MkV/L spherical photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) recorder (AlecElectronics) was placed below the surface (0.3 m depth) to record the diurnal underwater light field, and four temperature loggers HOBO Pro V2 (Onset) were positioned every meter in a vertical line.;  The attenuation coefficient Kd was determined from single profiles of discrete PAR measurements taken using a LI-192 underwater quantum sensor connected to a LI-1400 data logger (Li-Cor).;  Dissolved oxygen sensors (optode technology, PONSEL Digisens) were suspended in the upper water column at depths of 15 cm and 50 cm, and dissolved oxygen saturation levels were recorded every 5 min.; The dissolved elements were measured using samples diluted in ultrapure water.; The mean Na+, Cl-, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42 concentrations and mean alkalinity expressed in mg/L in Dziani Dzaha were compared against data for 34 inland alkaline and/or saline systems as well as standard seawater composition (n = 50, data compiled from [3, 4, 25–29]).;  Hierarchical clustering using water composition values [30, 31] was performed using PAST 2.13 freeware [32] and Ward’s minimal variance method.; The microbial taxa were isolated and cultured to select eubacterial strains, both photosynthetic (cyanobacteria) and heterotrophic, using a single water sample collected in October 2011 at a depth of 0.5 m in the middle of the oxygenated layer.;  Planktonic Archaea were identified using a cloning-sequencing approach, from the same single water sample, without pre-culturing.; For the cultivation of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria, 1mL of a surface water sample (2011 survey) was mixed with 10% glycerol and immediately put in liquid nitrogen.; Prokaryotic genomic DNA from a surface water sample (2011 survey) was extracted from a 20 mL subsample prefiltred at 3.0 μm, and collected onto a 0.2 μm filter using the Power Water DNA isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories) as described by the manufacturer for maximum yield.;  The rationale and classification for fluorescence parameters are reviewed in [46]. A Junior-PAM with a white LED (Walz) was used as described in [47] to record in vivo fluorescence transients. 5 mL dark-adapted water samples were filtered onto 25 mm GF/F for 15’ using a pre-soaked paper filter.;  Anoxic water samples were inoculated anaerobically in a N2-filled hood, and each well was covered by 25 μL of paraffin oil.;  Another microplate was incubated in air with oxic water samples, and both microplates were kept in the dark for six days at room temperature (26–28°C).; The temperature was stable within the water column below a depth of 1 m, whereas the surface waters showed daily fluctuations, reaching up to 35°C in the top few centimeters (Fig 2A).;  On average, at a depth of 1 m the water temperature was 28.5°C in 2010 and 29.1°C in 2011 and 27.8 at a depth of 4 m in 2010 and 27.9°C in 2011 (Fig 2B).;  In 2010, the mean temperature for the lower water column increased from 27.4°C to 27.9°C (rate of 0.07°C d-1), whereas in 2011 it increased from 27.8°C to 28.7°C (rate of 0.08°C d-1) during the survey periods.; The vertical pH profiles showed little variation throughout the water column, ranging from 9.1 to 9.4 depending on the sampling date (Fig 2A).;  There was no significant vertical stratification of the water column for pH or conductivity.;  The elemental ratio compared to seawater is slightly higher for chlorine (40%), more than double for sodium, and more than three times higher for potassium, with an ionic strength 1.5 higher than seawater.;  CO32-) in Dziani Dzaha water.; Hierarchical clustering discriminates Dziani Dzaha waters from most of the other alkaline and/or saline lakes in the comparison (n = 56) and shows that it is closely correlated with standard seawater and the Corangamite Lake (an Australian endorheic salt lake), despite significant differences in alkalinity (Fig 3).;  Cluster I had lakes with high sulfate concentrations and high alkalinity, with moderate sodium and chloride content (S1 Table), and included several Rift Valley lakes and Western Australian water bodies.;  Two clusters grouped lakes with waters close to standard seawater: cluster Va with 4 Australian lakes and one Andean lake with low alkalinity, and cluster Vb with high alkalinity and balanced Na+ and Cl- concentrations, including Dziani Dzaha.; Oxygen concentration was very high at the top of the water column, reaching over 200% of saturation at midday, and decreased sharply to zero at depths below 1.5 to 2 m (Fig 2A).; Color development on Biolog Ecoplates started to develop in less than 24 h after inoculation with Dziani Dzaha water.; Dissolved organic carbon concentrations were relatively homogeneous on the water column, with a mean of 77.5 mg L-1 (n = 11) in 2010 and 66,6 mg L-1 (n = 25) in 2011, and C:N ratio for dissolved organic matter enriched in carbon relative to particulate matter (Table 7).; Dziani Dzaha is a shallow lake, with no vertical stratification during dry season except for dissolved oxygen, and the water buffering characteristics explain the pH stability despite high primary production rates at the surface.;  Hierarchical clustering is mainly driven by the sodium and chloride concentrations, which are the main factors explaining the similarity with standard seawater (Fig 3).;  The origin of the Dziani Dzaha water is most probably from the nearby ocean through bedrock seepage and geological fracturation, with subsequent modifications by precipitation inputs, hydrothermal activity, precipitation of dissolved elements and biogeochemical activity, as shown in many alkaline environments where photosynthetic organisms drive high pH conditions [8]. This marine origin is unlike that of most known soda lakes, which are inland water bodies whose salinity is due to dissolved continental minerals [4].; The high turbidity and low light penetration in Dziani Dzaha is typical of hypereutrophic ponds and lagoons [57] where resident phytoplankton and suspended detritic material absorb most of the incident light in the upper water layer.;  Relative photosynthetic activities were high, falling into the same range as rETR values reported for cyanobacterial cultures [47, 58] and blooms [59]. The uniform transient fluorescence characteristics, over time and all sampling depths, strongly indicates that the cyanobacterial populations were always in good health, so far as photosynthetic activity was concerned, and were uniform and stable even in the lowest part of the water column.;  According to [23], in eutrophic lakes the uncertainties are reduced even when input values such as piston velocity and O2 saturation in the water body are approximated.;  Assuming a mean total particulate carbon of 35 mg C L-1 (Table 5) and a total photosynthetic carbon biomass of 140 g C m-2 for a 4 m deep water column, a daily production of 8.3 g C m-2 d-1 represented only 6% of the total stock.;  The cultivable eubacteria community is thus dominated by taxa usually found in saline and alkaline habitats, as expected for the properties of Dziani Dzaha water.;  Based on ACWD values, anaerobic samples from deep water appeared to be generally the most efficient in metabolizing organic substrates.;  However, the high utilization rate of deep water samples was not the result of the utilization of a broad spectrum of carbon sources but was driven by the extremely high utilization of some compounds (here amino acids and carbohydrates) metabolized in anoxic conditions.;  In alkaline and saline environments Euryarchaeota have been reported to be the most abundant [65] and, unlike lakes with high sulfate content such as the temperate Soap Lake [64], the chemical nature of Dziani Dzaha waters does not seem to be compatible with high densities of sulfate-reducing bacteria that could outcompete methanogens.; The physical and chemical characteristics of Dziani Dzaha are significantly different from other tropical soda and saline lakes, mainly owing to its extremely high alkalinity and the relative similarity of the dissolved element composition to seawater [74]. None of the standard criteria for extreme environments (temperature, salinity, pH) apply directly to this ecosystem but, in combination, the lake comes within the upper limits for inland aquatic ecosystems.;  The primary production rates in Dziani Dzaha, calculated from the in situ dissolved oxygen evolution, are close to the upper limit predicted for inland waters [16] and appear to be limited by light availability and self-shading of biomass.;  Metagenomic approaches are now required to estimate the microbial diversity, together with functional studies to evaluate the community turnover rate in Dziani Dzaha and identify the metabolic functions supported in the water column and superficial sediment.;  This will provide information about the nature (local vs. ubiquitous) of microbial components, and enable a comparison with other inland water bodies.;  Most of all, the definition of a core microbiome will also help to determine and understand the biogeochemical mechanisms related to the more global cycle that defined the original nature of Dziani Dzaha Lake waters.;  These are the main objectives of a four year multi seasonal survey started in 2014 [74] to study microbial diversity, matter and energy flow in water column, surface gas exchanges, and sedimentary deposit in Dziani Dzaha."
"oxygen","D010100",28045976,5207672," In situ daily photosynthetic oxygen production ranged from 17.3 to 22.2 g O2 m-2 d-1, consistent with experimental production / irradiance measurements and modeling.;  Finally, the associated metabolism (photosynthetic oxygen production) and community metabolic potential (use of combined carbon sources) were evaluated.;  Dissolved oxygen sensors (optode technology, PONSEL Digisens) were suspended in the upper water column at depths of 15 cm and 50 cm, and dissolved oxygen saturation levels were recorded every 5 min.;  This method is considered to give a robust estimate of oxygen metabolism, as it takes account of physical diffusion.;  The dissolved oxygen was supersaturated in the upper layer of the lake most of the time and, therefore, some was lost to the atmosphere.; The microbial taxa were isolated and cultured to select eubacterial strains, both photosynthetic (cyanobacteria) and heterotrophic, using a single water sample collected in October 2011 at a depth of 0.5 m in the middle of the oxygenated layer.; Photosynthetic oxygen evolution (PSOE) was monitored as a proxy for photosynthetic activity. 30 mL samples were distributed in gas-tight polycarbonate flasks.;  The dissolved oxygen concentration was measured every twenty minutes over the 4–6 h incubation period, the linearity of the oxygen concentration changes over time was checked, and the photosynthetic oxygen evolution (PSOE) rates were plotted against irradiance using the model of Platt et al. [48]:
; The PSOE parameters (α, β and Pmax) obtained from the incubation experiments were used to model the instantaneous gross oxygen production rates at given times depending on the instantaneous light field and the actual chlorophyll a biomass.;  The rationale is described in [49], and the cumulative instantaneous oxygen production rates were used estimate the daily gross O2 production per square meter of lake (GPP):
; Assuming a constant respiration rate, calculated from samples incubated in the dark, the net oxygen production was obtained by subtracting the daily respiration from the daily gross production.; (A) Temperature (°C, black diamonds), salinity (psu, blue squares) and dissolved oxygen concentration (mg L-1, red circles) are given for CLB station of Dziani Dzaha Lake in 2010 (closed symbols) and 2011 (open symbols).

(C) Box-plot of all conductivity records during the two surveys (n = 370 for 2010; n = 252 for 2011).;  The subsurface diurnal cycles recorded during the 2011 survey showed a clear day/night pattern, but without total nocturnal depletion of the dissolved oxygen.;  At 31°C and 52 psu, the oxygen saturation corresponded to a concentration of 5.6 mg O2 L-1 in the top 50 cm layer, and the dissolved oxygen never dropped far below this value even at night time.; The oxygen variation in the lake, measured at depths of 15 cm and 50 cm in 2011, showed a clear pattern of net production during the daytime and net consumption at night (S1 Fig).;  Salinity remained almost constant (51.3–52.7 psu) during the two days of dissolved oxygen measurement.; Staehr et al. [23] method was used to fit optode in situ measurements, whereas Bright and Walsby [49] method was used to model production integral according to laboratory photosynthetic oxygen evolution (PSOE) measurements.;  The mean values for maximum oxygen production rates (Pmax) ranged from 5.61 to 11.76 mg O2 mg chl a-1 h-1 (equal to 175–368 μmol O2 mg chl a-1 h-1) during the 2011 survey and the PSOE half-saturation flux density was 99 μmol photons m-2 s-1.;  Both Pmax and α values, calculated from the oxygen production measurements, are within the standard range reported for cyanobacterial blooms.; § productivity is expressed as μmol electrons m-2 s-1 for PAM fluorometry, and as μmol O2 mg chl a-1 h-1 for photosynthetic oxygen evolution.; Using α, β and Pmax derived from PSOE curves, the daily oxygen production was calculated using the method described in [49]. Using the input values listed in Table 4 for PSOE, a constant [chl a] of 612 μg L-1 over the whole well-lit layer (mean of 2011 values excluding outliers), the averaged light measurements at a depth of 0.3 m (mean of 10 days, n = 720 for daytime periods) and a PAR attenuation coefficient Kd = 6.79 m-1, the instantaneous O2 gross production was calculated for 10 min intervals at a 10 cm resolution, giving a GPP of 19.4 g O2 m-2 d-1 (Table 3).; Dziani Dzaha is a shallow lake, with no vertical stratification during dry season except for dissolved oxygen, and the water buffering characteristics explain the pH stability despite high primary production rates at the surface.;  For carbon production, assuming a photosynthetic quotient PQ (molar ratio of O2 evolved to CO2 fixed) equal to 1 [9], the two days of dissolved oxygen measurements were consistent with a daily carbon fixation of 8.3 g C m-2 d-1.;  However, oxygen production in Dziani Dzaha was less than the early estimates of [14] for the upper limits of photosynthetic productivity (43–57 g C m-2 d-1) in soda lakes.;  It has already been shown that, as oxygen is depleted, microbial communities use carbohydrates in preference to carboxylic acids and amino acids [67]. Several other compounds such as glycogen and pyruvic acid were products or end-products of the anaerobic metabolism of glucose, here preferentially metabolized in samples AN10 and AN11.;  The primary production rates in Dziani Dzaha, calculated from the in situ dissolved oxygen evolution, are close to the upper limit predicted for inland waters [16] and appear to be limited by light availability and self-shading of biomass.; Central panel: oxygen concentration evolution at 0.15 m (grey circles) and 0.5 m (black circles) depth in Dziani Dzaha Lake.;  Upper panel: example of linearization of production periods, used to calculate photosynthetic oxygen production rates.;  Lower panel: example of linearization of consumption periods, used to calculate oxygen respiration rates."

(8) showed growth, survival, and methane production by a methanogen at 122 °C where the high pressure (20 MPa, ∼200 atmospheres) stabilized the liquid water.;  At higher pressure water can be liquid at even higher temperatures.;  However, as water is heated and maintained as a liquid under pressure, the dielectric constant and the polarity of the liquid decreases sharply, thus significantly changing its characteristics as a solvent and its interaction with dissolved biomolecules, in particular lipids, but also proteins and nucleic acids.;  It is likely that the destabilization of lipid bilayers as they become soluble in the lower dielectric constant water is what sets the high-temperature limit on life.;  Hot water in contact with rocks can be efficient in generating or recycling redox couples––this has been suggested for the interior of Enceladus (29).; On worlds where the temperature is within the range discussed above, life may be limited by the availability of water; Mars is an example of this.;  In dry environments phototrophs seek shelter and water retained in, and below, rocks.;  The water to support their growth comes from absorption of atmospheric moisture by the deliquescence of the salt (31).;  Fig. 3C shows lichen forming a green and black layer inside sandstone from the Dry Valleys of Antarctica, which obtain water from melting of occasional snow (37, 38).;  A key question for life on exoplanets is how long the habitable conditions––liquid water––must persist for life to begin.; In the previous sections, the considerations of life on exoplanets have centered on Earth-like life requiring liquid water.;  However, it may be that liquids other than water are also suitable media for carbon-based life forms.;  Benner et al. (65) first suggested that the liquid hydrocarbons on Titan could be the basis for life, playing the role that water does for life on Earth.;  Those researchers concluded that in many senses, hydrocarbon solvents are better than water for managing complex organic chemical reactivity.;  Based on our understanding of life on Earth we can present a checklist for speculating on the possibilities of life on these distant worlds.

(ii) If the world is arid, are there at last a few days per year of rain, fog, snow, or RH > 80%? (iii) Are there adequate light or geothermal energy sources––light determined by distance from the star, geothermal energy estimated by bulk density? (iv) Are the UV and ionizing radiation below the (very high) limits of microbial tolerance? (v) Is there a biologically available source of nitrogen?

(C) Survival rate of the salt-treated plants after recovery.; Then, to see if the improved salt tolerance of the TsTIP1;2-overexpressing plants resulted from a change in cellular Na+ levels, the Na+ contents of wild-type and transgenic seedlings were examined using the fluorescent dye Sodium Green.;  Previously, it was reported that an AQP could confer both drought and salt tolerance to transgenic plants (Peng et al. 2007, Sade et al. 2009).; It has been shown that Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the wheat TaNIP gene accumulated higher K+ and Ca2+, and lower Na+ than the wild-type plants under salt stress (Gao et al. 2010).;  However, Arabidopsis plants overexpressing wheat TaAQP8 accumulated higher Na+ and K+ than wild-type plants in roots under salt stress (Hu et al. 2012).;  Peng et al. (2007) reported that overexpression of the ginseng PgTIP1 in Arabidopsis plants resulted in an increase in the Na+ level, but no change in the K+ level under salt stress.;  Although these studies indicated that AQPs affected ion contents in plant cells under salt stress, the mechanistic details remain unclear.; In our study, we found that TsTIP1;2 overexpression elevated the cellular Na+ levels in transgenic plants, but without significantly affecting K+ levels under salt stress (Fig. 8B; Supplementary Fig.;  It is known that sequestration and accumulation of Na+ ions in the vacuoles is an effective mechanism for increasing plant salt stress tolerance (Zhu 2003, Yamaguchi and Blumwald 2005, Ruiz-Lozano et al. 2012).;  Our results provide an intriguing clue for exploring the mechanisms by which plant AQPs function in the development of salt stress tolerance.;  Thellungiella salsuginea is a halophytic plant highly tolerant to cold, drought, oxidative and salt stresses (Taji et al. 2004, Wu et al. 2012)."
"water","D014867",24214268,3894706," TsTIP1;2 had water channel activity when expressed in Xenopus oocytes.;  Many AQPs can conduct water or another small molecule, and a number of them are permeable to more than one substrate.;  For example, tobacco NtAQP1 can conduct water and CO2 (Uehlein et al. 2003), rice OsNIP2;1 can conduct selenite and silicon (Zhao et al. 2010), tobacco NtTIPa can conduct water, glycerol and urea (Gerbeau et al. 1999), and rice OsLsi1 and Arabidopsis AtNIP5;1 can conduct silicon, boron and arsenic (Mitani-Ueno et al. 2011).;  To see if increased drought tolerance is associated with water status, the relative water content (RWC) and water loss rates of leaves from wild-type and transgenic plants were measured and compared.;  The water content of the transgenic leaves was higher and the water loss rates were lower than in the wild-type leaves (Fig. 3E, F).;  These results indicate that overexpression of TsTIP1;2 could confer improved drought tolerance to the transgenic plants by decreasing the water loss rate, which alleviated or prevented damage caused by the drought stress.

(E) Relative water contents (RWCs) in aerial parts of the pot-grown plants before or after withholding water for 1 week. (F) Water loss rate in aerial parts of the pot-grown plants.;  The water transport capacity of TsTIP1;2 was tested in the Xenopus oocyte system.;  After incubation for 3 d, the rates of change in oocyte volume were measured in the hypo-osmotic solution and then the water permeability coefficient (Pf) values were calculated and statistically analyzed.;  The Pf values of TsTIP1;2, AtTIP1;1 and water-injected oocytes were 32, 66 and 7.7 µm s−1, respectively (Fig. 6B).;  Compared with water-injected control, the oocytes injected with TsTIP1;2 cRNA showed a 4.2-fold increase in Pf, indicating that TsTIP1;2 possesses water transport activity.;  In comparison with AtTIP1;1, the apparent water channel activity of TsTIP1;2 is weaker (Fig. 6B).
;  The water-injected oocytes were used as a negative control.;  Asterisks indicate significant differences in comparison with oocytes injected with water (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, Student’s t-test).;  TsTIP1;2 transgenic Arabidopsis plants exhibited a substantially increased tolerance to drought stress, and the water content increased while the water loss rate decreased in transgenic plants as compared with the wild-type control under water-deficit conditions (Fig. 3).;  These data implied that overexpression of TsTIP1;2 provided the transgenic plants with the ability to decrease rapid loss of water under drought conditions.; Although the important roles of AQPs in plant water balance are well documented in glycophytes, the contribution of these proteins to hypertolerance to abiotic stresses in extremophytes remains unclear.;  Also, we compared the water-conducting activity of TsTIP1;2 with that of its Arabidopsis homolog AtTIP1; the results indicated that TsTIP1;2 possessed a weaker water-channeling capacity than AtTIP1 in Xenopus oocytes.;  Different water-channeling activities of AQPs in T. salsuginea may be associated with water use efficiency of this extremophyte plant.;  Taken together, our results implied that AQP proteins may have crucial roles in the adjustment of the water relations in T. salsuginea for the plant to adapt to the harsh environment.; Seeds of T. salsuginea were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol for 30 s and 10% NaClO for 10 min, and washed five times with sterile water.;  For MDA measurement under drought stress, 2-week-old seedlings were grown in pots without watering for 1 week.; For measurement of RWC, the FW of whole aerial parts of watered or drought-treated plants was determined.;  Then these plants were saturated in distilled water at 4°C for 8 h and their turgid weights (TWs) were measured.;  For measurement of water loss rate, aerial parts from watered 2-week-old wild-type and TsTIP1;2 transgenic plants were weighed every 1 h until signs of wilting appeared.;  The oocytes were injected with 50 nl of water or RNA solution (10 ng of RNA).;  The osmotic water permeability coefficient (Pf) of oocytes, determined as described by Zhang and Verkman (1991), is defined as: Pf = V0 × [d(V/V0)/dt]/[S × Vwater × (Osmin – Osmout)]. The oocyte diameter (R) was measured as the maximal cross-sectional area of the oocytes and it was used to calculate the oocyte volume (V0) and oocyte surface area (S). d(V/V0)/dt is the relative volume increase per unit time.;  Vwater is the molar volme of water (18 cm3 mol−1), Osmin is 200 mOsm and Osmou is 100 mOsm.; For evaluation of the Na+ content in the vacuoles of transgenic and wild-type plants, roots of 10-day-old seedlings were stained with 10 µM Sodium Green Indicator (Molecular Probes) for 2 h, washed three times with double-distilled water, treated with double-distilled water or 300 mM NaCl, and visualized with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica, Germany).;  The whole plants were harvested, washed four times with double-distilled water and then baked at 60°C for 48 h."
"H2O2","D006861",24214268,3894706," TsTIP1;2 was also able to conduct H2O2 molecules into yeast cells in response to oxidative stress.;  Collectively, these data showed that TsTIP1;2 could mediate the conduction of both H2O and H2O2 across membranes, and may act as a multifunctional contributor to survival of T. salsuginea in highly stressful habitats.; In addition to H2O, plant AQPs are permeable to a wide range of small neutral molecules; these molecules include glycerol, urea, boric acid, silicon, CO2, NH3/NH4+ and H2O2 (Biela et al. 1999, Gerbeau et al. 1999, Uehlein et al. 2003, Loque et al. 2005, Ma et al. 2006, Bienert et al. 2007, Schnurbusch et al. 2010).;  Total RNA was isolated from 2-week-old plants treated with drought stress (B), 300 mM NaCl (C), 25 µM MV (D), 10 mM H2O2 (E) or 50 µM ABA (F), for 0, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h, respectively.;  TsTIP1;2 transcripts increased in response to all the tested treatments, including salt, drought, methyl viologen (MV), H2O2 and ABA (Fig. 2B–F).;  After H2O2 treatment, TsTIP1;2 expression showed the highest level at 6 h.; The induced expression of TsTIP1;2 in response to treatment with H2O2 or MV prompted us to investigate the possible involvement of TsTIP1;2 in the development of oxidative stress tolerance.;  As H2O2 is unstable, we chose MV, a strong and steady oxidative stressor that causes production of reactive oxyen species (ROS; mainly H2O2) in the chloroplasts (Dodge 1971, Kraus and Fletcher 1994).; The enhanced tolerance of TsTIP1;2 transgenic plants to oxidative stress suggested that TsTIP1;2 may also be permeable to H2O2.;  To see if this holds true, we employed the yeast system to test H2O2 permeability of TsTIP1;2.;  TsTIP1;2-transgenic yeast cells were grown on solid medium containing various concentration of H2O2 at 30°C for 6 d.;  As seen in Fig. 7A, expression of TsTIP1;2 markedly affected cell growth and the effect increased with increasing concentrations of H2O2 in the medium.;  We monitored the H2O2 levels in yeast cells using the intracellular ROS-sensitive fluorescent dye CM-H2DCFDA.;  Upon addition of H2O2 to the medium, TsTIP1;2-expressing yeast cells showed a dramatic fluorescence increase and this change was not so obvious in the control cells (Fig. 7B; Supplementary Fig S4), indicating that TsTIP1;2 had the capability to take up H2O2.;  To confirm such an activity of TsTIP1;2, transgenic yeast cells were treated with AgNO3, a known blocker of AQP channels (Hooijmaijers et al. 2012), and the cellular H2O2 content was measured.;  As shown in Fig. 7C, AgNO3 blocked the increase of the fluorescent signal in TsTIP1;2 transgenic yeast cells after H2O2 stress treatment.;  These data suggested that the inhibited growth of the TsTIP1;2 transgenic yeast cells was a result of H2O2 influx.

"carbon","D002244",36937286,10020504," To elucidate the molecular basis of such adaptation to high inorganic carbon and NaCl concentrations, a high-throughput label-free quantitation based quantitative proteomics approach was applied.;  Soda lakes have saline water dominated by sodium and carbonate species, typically exceeding a pH of 9.;  Among microalgae, prokaryotic cyanobacterial strains Arthrospira (Spirulina) platensis (Kishi and Toda, 2018; Ye et al., 2020), Euhalothece sp. isolated from soda lake have been shown to be suitable for bicarbonate based integrated carbon capture production system (Mikhodyuk et al., 2008; Gerasimenko and Mikhodyuk, 2009; Chi et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2018).;  The strain exhibited vigorous growth in a culture medium containing mainly Na2CO3, 50 g/l; NaHCO3, 50 g/l; NaCl, 50 g/l (salinity ≈150 ‰, DIC ≈ 1 M NaHCO3/Na2CO3) at pH 10 and was prospected to be promising for bicarbonate-based biomass production and carbon capture (Singh et al., 2022).; In the present study, a high-throughput label-free quantitation (LFQ) based quantitative proteomics approach was used to study the proteome of haloalkaliphilic algal strain P. salinarum SLJS6 in response to high NaCl and inorganic carbon concentrations (salinity-alkalinity treatment).; P. salinarum SLJS6 (Genbank Accession no. {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MW750597"",""term_id"":""2006471237"",""term_text"":""MW750597""}}MW750597) was previously isolated from brine water of hypersaline Sambhar soda lake and was found suitable for bicarbonate-based biomass production and carbon capture owing to its remarkable growth in an enriched soda lake medium (M medium) containing high concentrations dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the form of carbonates and high salinity as NaCl (Singh et al., 2022).; The protein samples extracted from the three biological replicates of both the control and treatment were used for LFQ-based quantitative proteomics analysis. 50 μg of each protein sample was first reduced using 5 mM tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TECP, Pierce) in 50 mM Ammonium Bicarbonate (ABC, pH ~ 8) at 37°C for 30 min and then alkylated using 50 mM Iodoacetamide (IAA, Sigma) in 50 mM ABC (pH ~ 8) in dark for another 30 min.; P. salinarum SLJS6 is a haloalkaliphilic strain, previously isolated from brine water of hypersaline Sambhar salt soda lake (Genbank Accession no. {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MW750597"",""term_id"":""2006471237"",""term_text"":""MW750597""}}MW750597) and was found suitable for bicarbonate-based biomass production and carbon capture, owing to its remarkable growth in an enriched soda lake medium (M medium) containing mainly Na2CO3, 50 g/l, NaHCO3, 50 g/l, NaCl, 50 g/l (salinity ≈150 ‰, DIC ≈ 1 M NaHCO3/Na2CO3) at pH 10.;  In order to get insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms that are driving this extraordinary growth, carbon assimilation and osmotic adaptation, the proteomics study was carried out under the respective conditions of alkalinity and salinity in the two aforementioned growth media.; Summary of protein changes in P. salinarum SLJS6 in response to high carbonates and NaCl concentrations (highly saline-alkaline environment).; Sorokin et al., 2015 have described an emerging concept of ‘natronophily’ which states that the prokaryotic isolates from soda lakes can grow in almost pure sodium carbonate brines without needing high concentrations of chloride salts as required by haloalkaliphiles and better called as “natronophiles.” Life in soda brines is very different from life in NaCl brines due to amount the osmotic pressure put on living systems by concentrations of these two salts, former being a weak electrolyte than the later, therefore providing a strong energetic advantage over the life in salt brines, even with the extra energy demand for maintaining drastic pH gradient.;  Similarly, an overall surge in its cellular photosynthetic activity reflected by the highly upregulated photosynthetic proteins, could be due to the plentiful availability of inorganic C (in the form of HCO3− and CO32−) for carbon-fixation in M medium.;  Photosynthesis comprises a series of electron transport reactions in the thylakoid membrane and carbon fixation reactions in the stroma.;  NADPH and ATP in turn are used to fix inorganic carbon in the Calvin-Benson cycle.;  In addition to this linear electron transport from water to NADP+, a cyclic electron transport operates at PSI that contributes to the supply of ATP for carbon fixation (Okegawa et al., 2020).;  The significantly increased abundances of PSI proteins in our treated samples suggest that the cells must have induced the cyclic electron transport chain to produce more ATP that could be used to fix more of inorganic carbon, corroborated by in tandem increase in ATP synthase subunits beta and alpha.;  In previous experiments conducted for assessing the prospects of isolate SLJS6 as promising candidate for bicarbonate-based biomass production and carbon capture, we found that the growth rate (0.2282 d−1) and biomass productivity (0.498 g/l/d) of P. salinarum was increased many folds (>35) in M medium compared to BG11 medium (Singh et al., 2022).;  The identified induced proteins in P. salinarum in response to high DIC (bicarbonate/carbonate alkalinity) and salinity (NaCl) suggest enhanced photosynthesis and remarkable osmoadaptation at expense of energy and provide insights into the extraordinary ability of this haloalkaliphilic picoalga to flourish in extreme conditions, corroborating to its occurrence in extremely saline-alkaline environments around the world, outcompeting the major primary producers at highest salinities (Krienitz and Kotut, 2010; Krienitz, 2018; Pálmai et al., 2020).;  As discussed earlier increased NADPH and ATP produced as a result of enhanced photosynthetic light reaction are used to fix inorganic carbon in the Calvin-Benson cycle (Munekage et al., 2004; Okegawa et al., 2020).;  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been previously reported to accumulate carbohydrate as starch in response to physiological stress (Longworth et al., 2012) resulting in storage of assimilated carbon that could be later used in biosynthesis of Triglycerides (Pick and Avidan, 2017).; By and large, our findings suggest that the haloalkaliphilic picoalga P. salinarum SLJS6 is endowed with innate complex mechanisms to adapt to highly saline-alkaline conditions and based on the knowledge acquired heretofore, it involves up-regulation of proteins and enzymes mainly involved in photosynthesis and carbon assimilation, ATP generation and protein folding-refolding."

Sorokin et al., 2015 have described an emerging concept of ‘natronophily’ which states that the prokaryotic isolates from soda lakes can grow in almost pure sodium carbonate brines without needing high concentrations of chloride salts as required by haloalkaliphiles and better called as “natronophiles.” Life in soda brines is very different from life in NaCl brines due to amount the osmotic pressure put on living systems by concentrations of these two salts, former being a weak electrolyte than the later, therefore providing a strong energetic advantage over the life in salt brines, even with the extra energy demand for maintaining drastic pH gradient.;  P. salinarum SLJS6 was isolated from salt brine (NaCl 345 g/l, pH 10) of a hypersaline soda lake, Lake Sambhar in India.;  NaCl, Na2SO4, Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 make up to 98% constituents of the Sambhar lake brine (Sinha and Raymahashay, 2004).;  The identified induced proteins in P. salinarum in response to high DIC (bicarbonate/carbonate alkalinity) and salinity (NaCl) suggest enhanced photosynthesis and remarkable osmoadaptation at expense of energy and provide insights into the extraordinary ability of this haloalkaliphilic picoalga to flourish in extreme conditions, corroborating to its occurrence in extremely saline-alkaline environments around the world, outcompeting the major primary producers at highest salinities (Krienitz and Kotut, 2010;

(2011), Narasingarao et al. (2012), and Martínez-García et al. (2014) suggest an anaerobic fermentative lifestyle, which contrasts to the principally aerobic respiratory metabolism suggested previously for “Candidatus Nanosalina” and “Candidatus Nanosalinarum” by Narasingarao et al. (2012).; The glycolytic pathway within their central carbon metabolisms appeared to be rather versatile as well.;  Together these genes encode the three main subunits of a putative aerobic carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH).;  While the use of CO as a sole energy and carbon source or as an alternate energy source coupled to CO2 fixation (“carboxydotrophy”) is typically restricted to few bacterial groups and can occur only under elevated CO concentrations, the use of CO at low concentrations as an alternative energy source (“carboxydovory”) is suggested to be widespread amongst heterotrophs (King and Weber, 2007; Cunliffe, 2011; King, 2013).;  The fact that some members of the Halobacteria might fulfill a primary rather than a secondary degrading function in the organic carbon cycle of soda lakes is supported by previous culture-dependent studies."

But, these changes reduce fluidity, increasing water permeability [65]. The increments in DBI and RUFA in our root plasma membrane as a consequence of the application of MWCNTs were higher than those induced by salinity; therefore, these carbon compounds produced more rigidity but probably also increased membrane permeability, relative to salt stress."
"water","D014867",27278384,4898372," Positive effect of MWCNTs on growth in NaCl-treated plants was consequence of increased water uptake, promoted by more-favourable energetic forces driving this process, and enhanced net assimilation of CO2.;  Also, enhanced aquaporin transduction occurred, which improved water uptake and transport, alleviating the negative effects of salt stress.; The positive effects of engineered nanomaterials on plants comprised increased germination percentage and rate; length of root and shoot, and vegetative biomass of seedlings with the involvement of distinct physiological processes related to the plant water balance, photosynthetic activity and nitrogen metabolism.;  Thus, the water status of many crops was affected by different nano-materials.;  It has been observed that coated seeds with nano-membranes may regulate the capacity of water imbibition when the seeds are ready to germination.;  Also, magnetic particles in seeds allowed the detection of moisture content during seed storage [1]. Ag nanoparticles reduced the effects of microbial infection on gerbera flowers, increasing the water uptake and turgidity [2]. TiO2 nanoparticles enhanced nitrate uptake in Soybean (Glycine max) plants, increasing the ability to absorb/use water, and promoting the antioxidant system.;  Also, TiO2 regulated water absorption in spinach seeds, with an increased germination rate [3]. However, contrast results were found for the effect of engineered nanomaterials on plant water uptake and growth.;  Excess of metals nanoparticles resulted in toxic effects that involved a decrease of growth and abnormalities in cell division [4]. Copper/copper oxide (Cu/Cu2O) nanoparticles may block water channels reducing water uptake [5].;  In a more-recent study, Khodakovskaya et al. [10] demonstrated that MWCNTs, introduced into the soil through watering, can affect the phenotype of adult tomato plants.; However, some reports have indicated negative effects of CNTs on plants [13]; At high concentrations, the accumulation of graphene decreased the root growth of red spinach and cabbage [14] as consequence of massive electrolyte leakage, indicating an oxidation stress mechanism and damage in the plasma membrane that may affect water and solute transport [15]. Fullerene was accumulated in the leaves following the symplastic route [16, 17] and the large aggregates accumulation within the vascular tissues may impede the appropriated translocation of water and nutrients to the aerial part [18]. Tiwari et al. have shown that maize seedlings grown in agar reduced dramatically their growth and water uptake after treatment with different concentrations of pristine MWCNTs [19].;  Hence, there is a need for further investigation before the application of CNTs can be considered as a widely-applicable means of increasing crop growth and productivity [20]. In the study of the molecular mechanisms by which CNTs may act on plant physiology, a correlation between the activation of plant cell growth after MWCNTs exposure and the up-regulation of genes involved in cell division/cell wall formation and water transport, such as those controlling synthesis of aquaporins, was found [21]. There are many reports indicating that aquaporins are crucial for root water uptake, seed germination, cell elongation, reproduction and photosynthesis [22]. Also, the expression of a large number of aquaporin proteins has been shown to occur predominantly in roots and different experimental procedures have demonstrated, in various species, that aquaporins activity is linked to plant hydraulics during abiotic stress [23]. However, it has been also demonstrated that MWCNTs may create new pores in the cell wall and plasma membrane allowing water transport to develop tomato and wheat seedlings [16, 17].; The inhibition of plant growth by salinity via its effects at the physiological, biochemical and molecular levels has been studied widely [25, 26]. The homeostasis of ions and water is the main physiological process that plants need to optimise in order to maintain growth in saline environments [27, 28]. Osmotic adjustment may help plant cells to withstand salt stress, specifically to cope with the water deficit generated by the salt-induced osmotic imbalance, through the maintenance of the water potential gradient between the plant and the substrate, which is necessary to conserve water uptake and cell turgor for growth [29, 30]. Therefore, salinity is probably the most-suitable abiotic challenge under which to investigate the effect of CNTs, due to the similarity of the processes involved to those of other environmental stresses.; Membrane transport proteins and the surrounding lipids are crucial regulators of nutrient and water acquisition and of the exchanges of molecules between subcellular compartments; hence, they are vital to the maintenance of turgor under saline conditions [31]. The trans-membrane water and solute fluxes are controlled by the abundance and activity of plasma membrane proteins [32]. Also, the early response of proteins to salinity may be involved in the modulation of growth-regulating mechanisms and membrane stability [33]. Also, changes in the chemical composition and physical properties of plasma membrane lipids have been observed as an adaptation to external salinity [34]. A decrease in the unsaturation of fatty acids has been reported, together with an increase of sitosterol [35]. In this sense, an increment in protein abundance in relation to the content of lipids in the plasma membrane was reported to play a role in the plasma membrane stability [36, 37]. In order to initiate further investigations at the intracellular level, the effect of MWCNTs on the plasma membrane should be elucidated.;  Therefore, in this work, we describe the results of applying commercial MWCNTs to control and salt-stressed (NaCl) broccoli plants in order to evaluate the effect of these synthetic CNTs on water and nutrient transport through the plasma membrane.;  The root hydraulic conductance, stomatal conductance, leaf water potential and CO2 fixation were measured as well as the mineral nutrient content, and the changes in the plasma membrane lipid composition were analysed and evaluated in relation to aquaporin abundance.;  Italica) were pre-hydrated with de-ionised water and aerated continuously for 12 h.; The leaf water potential (Ψω) of the third fully-expanded leaf was measured in the middle of the photoperiod using the pressure chamber technique [45].;  Similar results were obtained for DWs (Additional file 3) since the relative water content was similar (~92 %) in all treatments.; The leaf water potential (Ψω) was reduced by salinity (Table 2).; Leaf water potential (ψw) (MPa) of control broccoli plants and plants treated with 10 mg l−1 MWCNTs, 100 mM NaCl and 100 mM NaCl + 0.10 mg l−1 MWCNTs; It has been previously demonstrated that MWCNTs can penetrate seed coats and promote germination and growth [9, 48, 49]. It has been observed that CNTs may promote water uptake as a growth stimulator [12, 50] with an increased expression of PIP1 genes in “in vitro” tobacco cell cultures [32]. However, the effect of MWCNTs on the plasma membrane properties and its ability to transport water under saline- stress conditions has not been studied.;  Improved growth due to MWCNTs application was related to increases in the nutrient and water uptake in maize cell cultured plants [19]. The authors considered the action of opposing forces, the CNTs ion-transient-dipole interaction, that retain ions in the roots and promote the water flow that facilitates further ion uptake.;  Root Na rise could be also the consequence of increased water uptake that was more efficient in MWCNTs-treated plants, which may be related directly to their greater growth.; Salinity in broccoli plants was also related to alterations of the membrane lipid composition and fluidity—that contribute to reductions of cell expansion [31]. This response was related to water uptake and transport—regulated by aquaporins functionality and abundance, key factors in the movement of water into the plant.;  In control and NaCl-treated plants supplied with MWCNTs, the greater presence of PIP1 and PIP2 aquaporins corroborated the increase in water passage through the plasma membrane that was related to higher L0.;  Therefore, the simultaneous rises in Gs and L0 induced by MWCNTs may indicate enhanced symplastic movement of water, through an increased abundance of aquaporins, which maintained the cellular water balance, ψw and, in turn, augmented plant growth.;  In previous work, HgCl2, a mercurial inhibitor of aquaporin functionality, was used; the reversal of its effect by DTT was used to demonstrate the absence of side effects [55]. Also, K+ leakage was used as a control [29]. Mercurials act through covalent union with cysteine residues of aquaporin proteins, within the water pore and in other regions of the protein, causing either blockage or conformational changes that lead to inhibition of water transport [56]. Thus, the use of alternative compounds such as azide, that inhibits protein phosphorylation and causes acidification of the cytoplasm, hence contributing to closure of the aquaporin channel [40], has been very useful due to the absence of side effects [41]. The azide results may demonstrate the involvement of the symplastic route of water movement in the NaCl + MWCNTs-treated plants with higher L0 reductions than control plants.; Carbon nanotubes can be taken up by roots and moved to the leaves [20]. Although interaction with mineral nutrients has not been claimed to be the driving force for apoplastic transport of MWCNTs, the driving force of water should allow their movement through the plant [20]. Also, their penetration through the cell wall and membranes has been observed only on some occasions, when the concentration of the nanotubes applied was high (100–1000 mg l−1) [58]. However, this not the case of our broccoli plants and MWCNTs pass through the cell wall in the plant mature stage and they were observed in intercellular spaces, vacuole, plasma membrane and cytoplasm in the cortical cells of the roots and stem in control and NaCl-treated plants.;  Thus, MWCNTs accumulation should be investigated in terms of the action driven by the root water pressure.;  The sitosterol/stigmasterol ratio was increased in the plasma membranes of plants exposed to salinity, indicating a swift increase in water permeability, since sitosterol has been found to be very efficient in regulating water permeability and salt protection [65, 66]. However, the ratio was strongly decreased by the MWCNTs, which have been reported to give rise to more-stable membranes in the raft domains [67]. This effect should be investigated; it could form part of a mechanism to compensate for greater water movement through the increased number of aquaporin proteins.; The increase in the DBI and RUFA of the fatty acid content in the leaf plasma membrane of NaCl-treated plants has been reported to be related to reductions in membrane fluidity [68]. But, these changes reduce fluidity, increasing water permeability [65]. The increments in DBI and RUFA in our root plasma membrane as a consequence of the application of MWCNTs were higher than those induced by salinity; therefore, these carbon compounds produced more rigidity but probably also increased membrane permeability, relative to salt stress.; Recently, it has been shown that plasma membrane lipid modifications in broccoli plants in response to salinity occurred in order to maintain protein function and ensure membrane permeability [36]. Also, the increased content of proteins, such as aquaporins, is relevant with regard to promotion of ion and water transport and maintenance of the electrostatic gradient across the plasma membrane, and hence cell homeostasis, but also for decreasing damage to the membrane and ensuring its stability [37]. Nevertheless, the observation that biological membranes are able to form ordered lipid domains (raft domains) that are highly stable [69] and enriched in aquaporins [70], but with unknown function, reinforces the idea that the variability of plasma membrane composition and fluidity, as a response to salinity and MWCNTs, may be the key to understanding their physiological effects.;  Also, the novel use of salt-stressed plants has shown that the MWCNTs influenced the primary plant response in relation to water and nutrient uptake.;  The positive biochemical changes found could simply have been due to the known physical changes produced in cells and tissues by the MWCNTs and under salt stress these compounds may retain Na ions in the root that promote water uptake.;  The plants appeared able to cope with changes in the water gradient through the imposed symplastic pathway, giving positive results."

"NaCl","D012965",27278384,4898372,"In this work, exploitation of commercial multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in control and 100 mM NaCl-treated broccoli was performed.;  Positive effect of MWCNTs on growth in NaCl-treated plants was consequence of increased water uptake, promoted by more-favourable energetic forces driving this process, and enhanced net assimilation of CO2.;  Therefore, in this work, we describe the results of applying commercial MWCNTs to control and salt-stressed (NaCl) broccoli plants in order to evaluate the effect of these synthetic CNTs on water and nutrient transport through the plasma membrane.;  The MWCNTs were added to the control medium at concentrations of 10, 20, 40 and 60 mg l−1: Another set of plants were treated with concentrations of 80, 100 and 120 mM NaCl.;  For further studies the combination of 100 mM NaCl + 10 mg l−1 MWCNT was chosen.; The second experimental set consisted of broccoli seedlings grown in Hoagland solution with NaCl (100 mM), with or without the simultaneous presence of 10 mg l−1 MWCNT.; The FWs were measured after application of salinity (100 mM NaCl) and 10 mg l−1 MWCNTs.;  The suitable concentration of NaCl was determined according to preliminary experiments where NaCl concentrations of 80, 100 and 120 mM were assayed (Additional file 2).;  Although a similar FW decrease was induced by both NaCl levels, 100 and 120 mM, we considered the latter inappropriate for broccoli plants [47]. Therefore, when 100 mM NaCl was supplied in combination with 10 mg l−1 MWCNTs, a positive effect on growth was observed, compared with the application of NaCl alone, with only a slight difference in FW with respect to control and MWCNTs-treated plants (Fig. 2).;

In our work, the NaCl concentration (100 mM) was higher than the maximum assayed in previous studies (80 mM), being based on the level at which growth decreased during a limited experimental exposure time.;  Thus, in previous report, we observed a biphasic growth inhibition of broccoli plants in response to salinity and during the second phase the internal injury was due to accumulation of salts in transpiring leaves [47]. In this work, similar K/Na ratios were observed in the shoots of NaCl and NaCl + MWCNTs-treated plants.;  The application of MWCNTs increased plant growth, the increment being higher in NaCl-treated plants, and the amelioration of the salinity effect was very apparent after 7 days of MWCNTs treatment.;  In control and NaCl-treated plants supplied with MWCNTs, the greater presence of PIP1 and PIP2 aquaporins corroborated the increase in water passage through the plasma membrane that was related to higher L0.;  Also, it has been reported that plant cell homeostasis in NaCl-treated plants must involve the combined regulation of L0 and Gs, with a consequent dependence on root aquaporins [54]. In our plants, MWCNTs slightly increased Gs and ACO2, even in the NaCl treatment, and a correlation between stomatal behaviour and L0 was observed under non-saline and saline conditions.;  In previous work, HgCl2, a mercurial inhibitor of aquaporin functionality, was used; the reversal of its effect by DTT was used to demonstrate the absence of side effects [55]. Also, K+ leakage was used as a control [29]. Mercurials act through covalent union with cysteine residues of aquaporin proteins, within the water pore and in other regions of the protein, causing either blockage or conformational changes that lead to inhibition of water transport [56]. Thus, the use of alternative compounds such as azide, that inhibits protein phosphorylation and causes acidification of the cytoplasm, hence contributing to closure of the aquaporin channel [40], has been very useful due to the absence of side effects [41]. The azide results may demonstrate the involvement of the symplastic route of water movement in the NaCl + MWCNTs-treated plants with higher L0 reductions than control plants.; Carbon nanotubes can be taken up by roots and moved to the leaves [20]. Although interaction with mineral nutrients has not been claimed to be the driving force for apoplastic transport of MWCNTs, the driving force of water should allow their movement through the plant [20]. Also, their penetration through the cell wall and membranes has been observed only on some occasions, when the concentration of the nanotubes applied was high (100–1000 mg l−1) [58]. However, this not the case of our broccoli plants and MWCNTs pass through the cell wall in the plant mature stage and they were observed in intercellular spaces, vacuole, plasma membrane and cytoplasm in the cortical cells of the roots and stem in control and NaCl-treated plants.;  A diffusion and leakage of MWCNTs in the aerial part must be not discarded as it was observed for SWCNTs when the size of particle is too small [59, 62]. By contrast, higher accumulations were observed in NaCl + MWCNTs-treated plants with lower Gs values that MWCNTs-treated plants.; The increase in the DBI and RUFA of the fatty acid content in the leaf plasma membrane of NaCl-treated plants has been reported to be related to reductions in membrane fluidity [68].

In broccoli plants, these results have been related to both stomatal aperture and photosynthetic rate or net CO2 assimilation (ACO2) [53]; stomatal closure resulted in a decrease in leaf transpiration and leaf internal CO2 concentration.;  Also, it has been reported that plant cell homeostasis in NaCl-treated plants must involve the combined regulation of L0 and Gs, with a consequent dependence on root aquaporins [54].

This response was related to water uptake and transport—regulated by aquaporins functionality and abundance, key factors in the movement of water into the plant.;  Although it has been pointed out that CNTs penetrate cells directly rather than through endocytosis [63] and that they can act as molecular transporters in walled cells [59], their passage through membranes seems to be related to the membrane stability and to lipid trapping by lipid exchange [64]. Therefore, the changes in control lipid composition in our membranes were a response to the MWCNTs and salinity.; Recently, it has been shown that plasma membrane lipid modifications in broccoli plants in response to salinity occurred in order to maintain protein function and ensure membrane permeability [36]. Also, the increased content of proteins, such as aquaporins, is relevant with regard to promotion of ion and water transport and maintenance of the electrostatic gradient across the plasma membrane, and hence cell homeostasis, but also for decreasing damage to the membrane and ensuring its stability [37]. Nevertheless, the observation that biological membranes are able to form ordered lipid domains (raft domains) that are highly stable [69] and enriched in aquaporins [70], but with unknown function, reinforces the idea that the variability of plasma membrane composition and fluidity, as a response to salinity and MWCNTs, may be the key to understanding their physiological effects."
"sulfur","D013455",20407798,2898105,"Anaerobic enrichment cultures with elemental sulfur as electron acceptor and either acetate or propionate as electron donor and carbon source at pH 10 and moderate salinity inoculated with sediments from soda lakes in Kulunda Steppe (Altai, Russia) resulted in the isolation of two novel members of the bacterial phylum Chrysiogenetes.;  The isolates, AHT11 and AHT19, represent the first specialized obligate anaerobic dissimilatory sulfur respirers from soda lakes.;  They use either elemental sulfur/polysulfide or arsenate as electron acceptor and a few simple organic compounds as electron donor and carbon source.;  Elemental sulfur is reduced to sulfide through intermediate polysulfide, while arsenate is reduced to arsenite.;  According to the phylogenetic analysis, the two strains were close to each other, but distinct from the nearest relative, the haloalkaliphilic sulfur-reducing bacterium Desulfurispirillum alkaliphilum, which was isolated from a bioreactor.;  On the basis of distinct phenotype and phylogeny, the soda lake isolates are proposed as a new genus and species, Desulfurispira natronophila (type strain AHT11T = DSM22071T = UNIQEM U758T).; The first haloalkaliphilic sulfur-respiring bacterium described as Desulfurispirillum alkaliphilum has recently been isolated from a full-scale bioreactor removing sulfide from biogas (Sorokin et al. 2007).;  In this anthropogenic system a short sulfur cycle at moderately haloalkaline conditions apparently takes place, i.e., sulfide oxidation to elemental sulfur at oxygen limitation as the main process and sulfur reduction at the expense of organic carbon excreted by the sulfide oxidizers as a minor unwanted reaction (Janssen et al. 2009).; Investigation of the reductive branch of the sulfur cycle (i.e., sulfidogenesis) at extremely haloalkaline conditions has so far been limited by dissimilatory sulfate reduction, which demonstrated that this process is very active in soda lake habitats and that novel lineages within the Deltaproteobacteria are responsible for this activity (Gorlenko et al. 1999; Sorokin et al. 2004; Scholten et al. 2005; Kulp et al. 2006; 2007; Foti et al. 2007; Zhilina 2007; Sorokin et al. 2008a).;  Meanwhile, the existence of short sulfur cycling similar to the example mentioned above might be predicted for the conditions of shallow hypersaline soda lakes, where sediments have high sulfide content at the top and low oxygen solubility in near bottom brines.;  One of the most interesting features of sulfur speciation at high pH is the appearance of linear polysulfide (−S–Sx–S−) as a stable intermediate, which, in contrast to cyclic elemental sulfur, is soluble, and, therefore, much more reactive.;  Polysulfides are the products of spontaneous reaction of sulfide and elemental sulfur.;  This makes sulfur cycling at high pH and, particularly, dissimilatory sulfur reduction where polysulfide is the actual electron acceptor (Hedderich et al. 1999), substantially different from those in the pH-neutral marine habitats.; Here we describe the properties of two novel obligately anaerobic bacterial isolates from hypersaline soda lakes in south-west Siberia, which represent the first highly specialized haloalkaliphilic dissimilatory sulfur/polysulfide reducers.;  The most important function of these bacteria is the potential to utilize acetate as electron donor with sulfur as electron acceptor at extremely haloalkaline anoxic conditions.; Samples of the top 5 cm sediments from soda lakes Tanatar-5 (pH = 10.15; salinity = 80 g l−1; total alkalinity = 0.98 M; HS− = 2.0 mM; July 2008) and Cock Soda Lake (pH = 10.3; salinity = 120 g l−1; total alkalinity = 0.82 M; HS− = 0.50 mM; July 2009) were used to enrich for sulfur-respiring haloalkaliphiles.;  Elemental sulfur (Fluka) was autoclaved as a thick water paste at 110°C for 40 min in closed bottles and added in excess of approximately 3 g l−1.;  The internal sulfur of the polysulfide was separated by acidification of the sample to pH <3 with concentrated HCl, then precipitated by centrifugation, washed with distilled water, dried, extracted from the cell pellet with acetone overnight and assayed by a cyanolytic procedure (Sörbo 1957).; Two positive anaerobic enrichment cultures with sulfur as electron acceptor were obtained from soda lake sediments at pH 10 and salinity 0.6 M total Na+: with acetate (lake Tanatar-5) and with propionate (Cock Soda Lake) as electron donor.;  Both cultures actively dissolved sulfur in the form of polysulfide and were dominated by highly motile spirilla.;  Liquid cultures at pH 9–10.5 developed in a peculiar structured way: active dissolution of insoluble elemental sulfur (which was at a large excess) occurred right above the flask bottom with a formation of an intense yellow layer of soluble polysulfide, while the upper part of the culture remained colorless or greenish (Supplementary Figure).;  This can be explained by the following: the bacteria utilized soluble polysulfide as the actual electron acceptor and produced sulfide which, in turn, immediately attacked the insoluble sulfur on the bottom to form polysulfide.;  Polysulfide molecules diffusing off the reaction site were reduced completely to sulfide which, in turn, rapidly reacted with sulfur.;  The greenish color is due to a presence of trisulfide (−S–S–S−) formed by an excess of HS−, while the yellow color indicates a presence of longer polysulfides at excess of elemental sulfur.

After mixing with the bulk culture, the color turned greenish due to rapid formation of a lower polysulfide with an average formula S32− due to a presence of excess of free HS−. Further fate of polysulfide depended on initial sulfur concentration.;  When limited, polysulfide started to disappear after complete sulfur dissolution and sulfide was the final product.;  Acetate consumption was parallel to the biomass and total reduced sulfur formation (Fig. 3).;  Maximal specific growth rate with acetate and sulfur at 0.6 M Na+ and pH 10 was 0.11 and 0.07 h−1 in strains AHT11 and AHT19, respectively.

Although transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images show the presence of an exopolysaccharide-like material around Nab. magadii cells (Figure ​(Figure3A),3A), purification and biochemical analyses of this material are yet to be accomplished.;  Nab. magadii contained six genes encoding putative polysaccharide biosynthesis proteins (Nmag_0147, 0922, 2457, 3122, 3272, and 3437).;  Other genes in the genome that encoded putative enzymes involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis included six polysaccharide deacetylases (Nmag_1899, 2045, 2647, 3024, 3271, and 3278), two polyprenyl glycosyl-phosphotransferases (Nmag_0111 and 1184, 65% identity at the predicted protein level), an O-antigen polymerase (Nmag_0143), two UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerases (Nmag_0149 and Nmag_0676), an acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase (Nmag_0148), an O-acetyltransferase (Nmag_0150), a N-acylneuraminate-9-phosphate synthase (Nmag_0151), and two capsule synthesis proteins (Nmag_1511 and 3999).;  It is possible that some of these genes are involved in the biosynthesis of Nab. magadii exopolysaccharide- or capsule-like material identified in the TEM images.;  The lightly stained material around the cell in panel A is probably an exopolysaccharide."
"thiamine","D013831",22559199,3403918," Pathways for the biosynthesis of thiamine, riboflavin, heme, cobalamin, coenzyme F420 and other essential co-factors were deduced by in depth sequence analyses.;  This section describes the genes related to the biosynthesis of thiamine, riboflavin, NAD, coenzyme F420, folate, heme, and cobalamin.; Vitamin B1 (thiamine pyrophosphate) is involved in several microbial metabolic functions [70]. Prokaryotes have evolved elaborate mechanisms to either synthesize this important co-factor de novo or acquire it from their niche [71]. Thiamine biosynthetic pathways among prokaryotes are very diverse [70]. Thiamine biosynthesis is accomplished by joining two intermediate molecules that are synthesized separately.;  However, β-grasp fold proteins have multiple functions in halophilic archaea, being involved in sulfur chemistry as well as ubiquitin-like protein modification by SAMPylation [56]. The specific β-grasp fold protein likely to participate in thiamine biosynthesis in Nab. magadii remains unidentified.;  In contrast, the ortholog of Nmag_2419 in Pyrococcus kodokaraensis (TK0434) does not have ribose-1,5-bisphosphate isomerase activity [72]. Biochemical characterization is required to ascertain the potential role of Nmag_2419 in thiamine biosynthesis.; Two distinct proteins, ThiE and ThiN, are known to join HMP-PP and HET-P to generate thiamine phosphate.;  At the last step, thiamine phosphate is predicted to be further phosphorylated to thiamine pyrophosphate by ThiL (Nmag_1515).;  In addition, Nab. magadii contained genes encoding a HET kinase (ThiM, Nmag_1810, predicted to be involved in thiamine salvage) and a thiamine transporter (ThiBPQ, Nmag_460-462; ThiB2, Nmag_1940)."
"riboflavin","D012256",22559199,3403918," Pathways for the biosynthesis of thiamine, riboflavin, heme, cobalamin, coenzyme F420 and other essential co-factors were deduced by in depth sequence analyses.;  This section describes the genes related to the biosynthesis of thiamine, riboflavin, NAD, coenzyme F420, folate, heme, and cobalamin.; Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is the precursor of coenzymes flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which are cofactors for several biochemical reactions [73]. Most bacteria, fungi, and plants can synthesize riboflavin de novo using one molecule of GTP and two molecules of ribulose 5-phosphate as substrates [74]. Riboflavin biosynthesis has been described in M jannaschii[75]. In general, reduction precedes deamination in the archaeal riboflavin biosynthesis pathway, which appears to be similar to the fungal pathway.;  In M. jannaschii, GTP cyclohydrolase III, the first enzyme of the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway, produces an archaeal-specific formylated intermediate that requires a subsequent deformylation step [75]. However, the haloarchaeal homolog of GTP cyclohydrolase III has not been identified thus far.;  Furthermore, riboflavin kinases of halophilic archaea are homologous to those of bacteria, but are unrelated to M. jannaschii riboflavin kinase.;  Conversely, riboflavin synthases of halophilic archaea are related to those of M. jannaschii, but are unrelated to bacterial riboflavin synthases.;  Overall, six genes encoding putative enzymes of the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway were identified in Nab. magadii and only two of these (Nmag_0941 and 0942) were clustered together (Table 2).;  Furthermore, 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino)uracil is an intermediate of coenzyme F420 and riboflavin biosynthesis pathways [76,77]. Although coenyzme F420 has been detected in some halophilic archaea [80], and coenyzme F420 biosynthesis genes have been identified among the methanogens [81], its precise function in halophilic archaea is unknown."
"heme","D006418",22559199,3403918," Pathways for the biosynthesis of thiamine, riboflavin, heme, cobalamin, coenzyme F420 and other essential co-factors were deduced by in depth sequence analyses.;  Recent advances in this area include the discovery of a new heme biosynthetic pathway [69], further understanding of the pathway of cobalamin biosynthesis, and the reconstruction of a complete pathway for coenzyme F420 biosynthesis in haloarchaea.;  This section describes the genes related to the biosynthesis of thiamine, riboflavin, NAD, coenzyme F420, folate, heme, and cobalamin.; Environmental bacteria utilize a variety of redox molecules such as porphyrins and other modified tetrapyrroles like heme, siroheme, and adenosylcobalamin for catalysis, energy transfer, and signal transduction [86]. These tetrapyrroles are synthesized de novo using a branched pathway and aminolevulinic acid as the precursor [87,88]. In most prokaryotes, the conversion of glutamate to aminolevulinic acid is catalyzed by glutamyl-tRNA synthetase, glutamyl-tRNA reductase, and glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase.;  Uroporphyrinogen III is converted to precorrin-2 in the biosynthetic pathway of adenosylcobalamin and siroheme, which was recently found to be an intermediate of heme biosynthesis (see below).; The heme biosynthesis pathway in archaea involving uroporphyrinogen III, precorrin-2, and siroheme appears to be similar to that of Desulfovibrio[69]. Conversion of uroporphyrinogen III into siroheme requires three functions (methylation by SirA, iron chelation, and oxidation by SirC).;  It is possible that cbiX2 functions as a ferrochelatase during siroheme/heme biosynthesis rather than as a cobaltochelatase during de novo cobalamin biosynthesis.; Didecarboxysiroheme, a common intermediate of heme and heme d1 biosynthesis, is generated by the decarboxylation of siroheme on the C12 and C18 acetyl groups [69]. Siroheme decarboxylase activity is attributed to the nirDLGH gene set, which is represented by a pair of two-domain proteins in halophilic archaea (AhbA/NirDL, Nmag_2894; AhbB/NirGH, Nmag_1221).;  The last steps of heme biosynthesis include the removal of acetyl side chains of Fe-coproporphyrin by AhbC (encoded by Mbar_A1793 in Methanosarcina barkeri) and the oxidative decarboxylation of heme by AhbD (encoded by DVU_0855 in Desulfovibrio) [69] [gene assignments: M.;  The presence of ahbC and ahbD in some halophilic archaea but not in others is believed to be due to metabolic heterogeneity rather than incomplete heme biosynthesis.;  Conversion of heme (also called heme B) into heme A in Nab. magadii was predicted to be catalyzed by CtaA and CtaB homologs (ctaA, Nmag_0636; ctaB, Nmag_2302)."

Halophilic archaea (e.g.Nmn. pharaonis) use the “anaerobic” branch, which is characterized by an oxygen-independent ring contraction process (cibG) [93]. However, it has been shown that Halobacterium synthesizes cobalamin de novo under aerobic conditions [91]. The “anaerobic” branch is also characterized by early cobalt insertion and Nmn. pharaonis has homologs of the ATP-independent early cobalt chelatase (CbiX) from Bacillus halodurans and Archaeoglobus fulgidus[94,95]. In the “anaerobic” branch, seven archaeal enzymes are known to be involved in the conversion of precorrin-2 into cobyrinic acid (cbiLcbiHcbiFcbiGcbiEcbiT, and cbiC), but two pathway gaps (corresponding to cbiD/cobF and cbiJ/cobK) still remain.;  A set of 11 genes is known to be involved in conversion of cobyrinic acid into adenosylcobalamin (cbiAcobA, pduO, cbiPcbiZcbiBcobYcobScobCcobD, and cobT).; Based on genome analyses, it appeared that Nab. magadii was incapable of de novo cobalamin biosynthesis since it lacked the genes encoding enzymes for conversion of precorrin-2 into cobyrinic acid.;  This is in contrast to Htg. turkmenica, which was predicted to be capable of de novo cobalamin biosynthesis since it contained the corresponding genes.;  Nab. magadii also contained a set of genes that were predicted to be involved in the conversion of cobyrinic acid into adenosylcobalamin, including a gene (cbiZ) that is specific to the archaeal corrinoid salvage pathway (Table 2).;  Htg. turkmenika, probably capable of de novo cobalamin biosynthesis, has orthologs of both cbiX1 and cbiX2.;  However, Nab. magadii, which is predicted to be incapable of de novo cobalamin biosynthesis, and therefore expected to lack these proposed early cobalt chelatases, surprisingly contained a cbiX2 ortholog (Nmag_3212).;  It is possible that cbiX2 functions as a ferrochelatase during siroheme/heme biosynthesis rather than as a cobaltochelatase during de novo cobalamin biosynthesis."
"coenzyme F420","C015084",22559199,3403918," Pathways for the biosynthesis of thiamine, riboflavin, heme, cobalamin, coenzyme F420 and other essential co-factors were deduced by in depth sequence analyses.;  Recent advances in this area include the discovery of a new heme biosynthetic pathway [69], further understanding of the pathway of cobalamin biosynthesis, and the reconstruction of a complete pathway for coenzyme F420 biosynthesis in haloarchaea.;  This section describes the genes related to the biosynthesis of thiamine, riboflavin, NAD, coenzyme F420, folate, heme, and cobalamin.;  Furthermore, 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino)uracil is an intermediate of coenzyme F420 and riboflavin biosynthesis pathways [76,77]. Although coenyzme F420 has been detected in some halophilic archaea [80], and coenyzme F420 biosynthesis genes have been identified among the methanogens [81], its precise function in halophilic archaea is unknown.;  A possible function of coenzyme F420 in the respiratory chain of Nab. magadii is discussed later in this paper.;  Although 13 nuo cluster subunits were conserved among halophilic archaea and E. coli, the nuoEFG subcomplex, which is involved in accepting NADH, was missing in halophilic archaea [23]. Furthermore, involvement of a type I complex in NADH reoxidation has been ruled out in Hbt. salinarum[110]. It is speculated that reduced coenzyme F420, which is similar to NADH in its redox potential, may interact with the nuo complex in halophilic archaea."
"carbon","D002244",22559199,3403918,"Based on genomic analyses, Nab. magadii is predicted to be metabolically versatile and it could use different carbon and energy sources to sustain growth.;  In addition, the large chromosome of Nab. magadii contained genes encoding a superoxide dismutase (sodA), two catalases (katG, which is common to most halophiles, and katE, which is closely related to katE of methanogens, also present in Htg. turkmenica and Hpg. xanaduensis, but not in other halophiles), two alkyl-hydroperoxidase-like proteins, a carbonic anhydrase, and methionine sulfoxide reductases (msrA and msrB; Additional file 1: Table S1).;  This suggests that the natural environment inhabited by Nab. magadii contains an ample supply of protein debris, which could be used as a major carbon and nitrogen source.;  The occurrence of genes encoding enzymes involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glycerol utilization suggests that Nab. magadii is metabolically versatile and can use different carbon and energy sources to sustain growth."
"salt","D012492",24915287,4051777,"The limitations of fungal laccases at higher pH and salt concentrations have intensified the search for new extremophilic bacterial laccases.;  While cotA from B. subtilis had optimal stability at pH∼8, the cotA from B. clausii displayed higher combined salt- and alkali-resistance.;  The new cotA is more resistant to alkaline and high salt conditions, but at the expense of a∼10 fold loss of catalytic proficiency, as estimated from kcat/KM, providing a new example of trade-off in laccases.; The effect of NaCl concentration on enzymatic catalysis was investigated in a series of measurements using variable salt concentrations and a pH range of 6–9.;  A similar change in ionic interactions as pH approaches the pKa of an important salt bridge might explain our observed enzyme activation at higher pH.;  Since NaCl activation occurred in combination with pH activation, it is possible that high ionic strength may destabilize labile salt bridges to give a similar response, but understanding the complex interplay of temperature, pH and salt on activation-inhibition of laccases clearly requires more mechanistic investigations.;  The kcat/KM values resulting from Gaussian fitting (Figure 6) are 10-fold higher for B. subtilis cotA, suggesting that the alkali-salt tolerance discussed above has been achieved at the expense of catalytic proficiency.;  We find that cotA from B. clausii has a shift in optimal pH for oxidation of phenolic substrates and a high salt resistance at high pH, compared to its ortholog from B. subtilis.;  This advantage is, as shown in this work, further enhanced by the interplay of salt and pH at alkaline conditions where the cotA enzymes, in particular the cotA from B. clausii, work well.; The additional proficiency of cotA from B. clausii could be due to substitutions relative to its B. subtilis ortholog that may repel anion inhibitors in the water exit channel (notably V110E, Figure 1), although this requires further investigation, as does the complex interplay between pH and salt.;  While this shift is consistent with higher alkali-salt tolerance and potentially explained by increased anion repulsion in the water exit channel, this tolerance has been at the expense of 10-fold lower kcat/KM (DMP) compared to cotA from B. subtilis."
"ABTS","C002502",24915287,4051777," We report activity on ABTS, SGZ, DMP, caffeic acid, promazine, phenyl hydrazine, tannic acid, and bilirubin at variable pH.;  Whereas ABTS, promazine, and phenyl hydrazine activities vs. pH were similar, the activity of B. clausii cotA was shifted upwards by ∼0.5–2 pH units for the simple phenolic substrates DMP, SGZ, and caffeic acid.;  Laccases catalyze the one-electron oxidation of four equivalents of a reducing substrate, and in turn reduce one dioxygen molecule completely to water [1], [2]. They oxidize a wide range of substrates, and this power can be further enhanced by the use of mediators such as 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS).;  The eight substrates and absorption wavelengths were 200 µM ABTS, 420 nm; 1 mM 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP), 468 nm; 50 µM syringaldazine, 530 nm; 1 mM caffeic acid, 485 nm; 1 mM promazine, 520 nm; 200 µM tannic acid, 355 nm, 1 mM phenylhydrazine, 400 nm, and 0.0025% bilirubin mixed isomers, 440 nm.;  ABTS and SGZ exhibited no auto-oxidation in the investigated pH range, whereas DMP, caffeic acid, and tannic acid showed steeply increasing auto-oxidation above pH ∼8.5, and phenylhydrazine turned yellow below pH 4 which complicated the readings.;  The activity was measured in a new 96-well plate by adding 180 µL 500 µM ABTS in 200 mM McIlvaine buffer pH 5 to 20 µL chilled protein sample and measuring the initial rate at 420 nm.;  Figure 1B shows the substrate binding pocket of cotA in complex with ABTS (3ZDW).; The pH-dependent activities were measured as initial linear rates, averaged over triplicate measurements for both laccases, using eight different substrates in the pH-range of 3–10: ABTS, SGZ, DMP, caffeic acid, promazine, phenyl hydrazine, and the more bulky tannic acid and bilirubin: Apart from hydrazine, all these substrates have previously been shown to be oxidized by some cotAs [16], [18].

(A) ABTS; (B) SGZ; (C) DMP; (D) Caffeic acid; (E) Promazine; (F) Phenylhydrazine; (G) Tannic acid; (H) Bilirubin.; We first compare our obtained activity of the cotA from B. subtilis with previous work, in particular the pH optima with ABTS, SGZ, and DMP [15], [35]. As seen in Figure 2A, the ABTS oxidation rate of cotA from B. subtilis has maximum near pH∼4.;  This value is consistent with the pHopt(ABTS) of ∼4 obtained previously for cotA from B. subtilis
[35]. Furthermore, the activity behavior vs. pH is quite similar for the new cotA across the pH range, given similar pHopt for this substrate.;  The pHopt was found to be in the range 4–5 for both enzymes on this substrate, i.e. slightly higher than for ABTS.;  First, promazine, ABTS, bilirubin, and to some extent phenylhydrazine and tannic acid show similar activity profiles vs. pH for the enzymes, with similar pHopt, despite some enhanced loss of B. clausii cotA activity at low pH for ABTS and phenylhydrazine."

As seen in Figure 2A, the ABTS oxidation rate of cotA from B. subtilis has maximum near pH∼4.; In terms of the phenolic substrate DMP (Figure 2C), we found an optimal turnover for B. subtilis cotA at pH∼7, which is in agreement with previously reported pHopt for this protein and substrate [35]. In contrast, the cotA from B. clausii was most effective above pH 8, showing a significant shift in pHopt (∼1.3) compared to the cotA from B. subtilis, further indicating enhanced alkalophilicity of the cotA from B. clausii.;  It is a general phenolic laccase substrate [16], but without the substituted methoxy groups of SGZ and DMP.; Second and in contrast, caffeic acid, SGZ, and DMP (and to some extent the polyphenol tannic acid) all have their active pH range increased for B. clausii cotA, compared to B. subtilis cotA.;  This is seen for SGZ, caffeic acid, DMP and to some extent for tannic acid, showing that this is a protein-specific effect.; In conclusion, the activity of the newly characterized cotA from B. clausii is in some ways similar to that of the cotA from B. subtilis, but its increased pHopt and the broadened activity profiles up to 1–2 units higher pH for the phenolic substrates DMP, caffeic acid, and SGZ suggest a mechanism of alkali-tolerance that is explored further below.; Laccases are well-known to be inhibited by small anions, as observed for fungal laccases at low pH [2], [3]. However, there are also previous reports that NaCl can activate proteins, as observed in another alkalophilic bacterial laccase [22], which displayed pHopt values of 7.9 for SGZ and 7.5 for DMP [54]. This effect seems to be complex and pH-dependent, as discussed previously: OH− and Cl− are likely to compete as inhibitors at the T2/T3 site of a laccase, as has been observed for fluoride [33], [55]. Also, both the Na+ and Cl− ions may affect the stability and turnover in some pH ranges due to non-specific electrostatic interactions with the proteins, e.g. via Hoffmeister effects.; To understand the causes of the pH-dependent activity differences between the two enzymes, which is most pronounced in DMP (Figure 2), we additionally performed a Michaelis Menten analysis for both enzymes at pH values of 5, 6, 7, 8, and 8.5 (full data in Figures S6, S7, and S8 in File S1).;  From this, we conclude that the pH-dependent differences measured from the assays of phenolic substrates, including DMP, are largely due to differences in kcat, i.e. the electron transfer catalytic step, and not substrate binding (KM).;  Our KM derived from non-linear fitting at pH 7 was 0.34 mM for cotA from B. subtilis, somewhat larger than the 0.23 mM determined by Durao et al. [40] As outlined in the supporting information (Figures S6 and S7 in File S1), DMP kinetics give rise to substrate inhibition.;  The measured KM for B. clausii cotA was 1.02 mM, similar to cotA from B. pumilus with reported KM 0.822 mM towards DMP at pH 7 and 37°C [58].; In addition to conversions between active and inactive forms, auto-oxidation, and buffer effects, which should be carefully accounted for during laccase characterization, we also observed a substantial non-competitive inhibition of both enzymes starting at DMP concentrations of ∼2.5 mM.;  While this shift is consistent with higher alkali-salt tolerance and potentially explained by increased anion repulsion in the water exit channel, this tolerance has been at the expense of 10-fold lower kcat/KM (DMP) compared to cotA from B. subtilis."

The data are shown with standard deviations in Figure 2.; We also investigated the activity of the two enzymes on promazine, a synthetic non-phenolic phenothiazine drug.;  In a large screening of laccase substrates, promazine was previously found to be oxidized by laccases of bacterial but not fungal origin [16], making it an interesting substrate to probe potential new oxidation capabilities of bacterial laccases.;  First, promazine, ABTS, bilirubin, and to some extent phenylhydrazine and tannic acid show similar activity profiles vs. pH for the enzymes, with similar pHopt, despite some enhanced loss of B. clausii cotA activity at low pH for ABTS and phenylhydrazine."

The data are shown with standard deviations in Figure 2.; We also investigated the activity on an unusual phenolic substrate, tannic acid (Figure 2G).;  In addition, tannic acids precipitate proteins and are considered a general plant defense against herbivores and bacteria.;  Tannic acids have been reported to inhibit tyrosinases [50]. The optimal pH activity profiles for oxidation of tannic acid (Figure 2G) are similar for both enzymes, with pH optima of ∼7.5±0.5, although the curve of B. clausii cotA shifted ∼0.5 pH units towards more alkaline conditions.;  First, promazine, ABTS, bilirubin, and to some extent phenylhydrazine and tannic acid show similar activity profiles vs. pH for the enzymes, with similar pHopt, despite some enhanced loss of B. clausii cotA activity at low pH for ABTS and phenylhydrazine.; Second and in contrast, caffeic acid, SGZ, and DMP (and to some extent the polyphenol tannic acid) all have their active pH range increased for B. clausii cotA, compared to B. subtilis cotA.;  This is seen for SGZ, caffeic acid, DMP and to some extent for tannic acid, showing that this is a protein-specific effect."
"bilirubin","D001663",24915287,4051777," We report activity on ABTS, SGZ, DMP, caffeic acid, promazine, phenyl hydrazine, tannic acid, and bilirubin at variable pH.;  The laccase has later been shown to oxidize a large variety of substrates, such as substituted aromatic compounds [16] and a number of important dyes [17]. In addition, it can function as a bilirubin oxidase [18], a low-affinity nitrous oxide reductase [19], and a manganese oxidase [20].;  The eight substrates and absorption wavelengths were 200 µM ABTS, 420 nm; 1 mM 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP), 468 nm; 50 µM syringaldazine, 530 nm; 1 mM caffeic acid, 485 nm; 1 mM promazine, 520 nm; 200 µM tannic acid, 355 nm, 1 mM phenylhydrazine, 400 nm, and 0.0025% bilirubin mixed isomers, 440 nm.; The pH-dependent activities were measured as initial linear rates, averaged over triplicate measurements for both laccases, using eight different substrates in the pH-range of 3–10: ABTS, SGZ, DMP, caffeic acid, promazine, phenyl hydrazine, and the more bulky tannic acid and bilirubin: Apart from hydrazine, all these substrates have previously been shown to be oxidized by some cotAs [16], [18]. The data are shown with standard deviations in Figure 2.; Finally, to further expand the chemical diversity, we also investigated the activity on bilirubin, which has been shown to be a substrate for several laccase-like enzymes, and also for cotA [18]. The results (Figure 2H) indicated a similar upper and lower pH for activity for the two enzymes, and the exact pHopt are similar within the uncertainties of the assay and comparable to that previously reported [18]. Thus, the bilirubin assay confirms that the alkaline advantage of the new cotA mainly manifests in the phenolic substrates.;  First, promazine, ABTS, bilirubin, and to some extent phenylhydrazine and tannic acid show similar activity profiles vs. pH for the enzymes, with similar pHopt, despite some enhanced loss of B. clausii cotA activity at low pH for ABTS and phenylhydrazine."
"NaCl","D012965",24915287,4051777," NaCl inhibited activity at acidic pH, but not up to 500–700 mM NaCl in alkaline pH, a further advantage of the alkali regime in laccase applications.;  At pH 8, both enzymes displayed substantial activation in NaCl before inhibition became dominant.; After the static incubation cells were harvested by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 12000 g and re-suspended in 20 mL cold lysis buffer 50 mM MOPS pH 7.8, 200 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM Pefabloc SC (Fluka), 0.01% Lysozyme.;  The protein was concentrated on a Vivaspin20 with 30 kDa cutoff (Sartorius), and the buffer was changed to 20 mM MOPS pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl, and purified on a source Q15 anion exchange column with a linear gradient between 50 mM and 1 M NaCl in MOPS pH 7.6 on an ÄKTA purifier.; The effect of NaCl concentration on enzymatic catalysis was investigated in a series of measurements using variable salt concentrations and a pH range of 6–9.;  Final concentration of buffer was 50 mM, whereas NaCl was varied between 0–1 M.; Laccases are well-known to be inhibited by small anions, as observed for fungal laccases at low pH [2], [3]. However, there are also previous reports that NaCl can activate proteins, as observed in another alkalophilic bacterial laccase [22], which displayed pHopt values of 7.9 for SGZ and 7.5 for DMP [54]. This effect seems to be complex and pH-dependent, as discussed previously: OH− and Cl− are likely to compete as inhibitors at the T2/T3 site of a laccase, as has been observed for fluoride [33], [55]. Also, both the Na+ and Cl− ions may affect the stability and turnover in some pH ranges due to non-specific electrostatic interactions with the proteins, e.g. via Hoffmeister effects.;  Thus, to optimize catalytic performance, it is of importance to understand how NaCl and pH play together to activate or inhibit laccase activity.; 
Figure 5 shows the activity (initial rates of SGZ product formation) of cotA from B. subtilis and B. clausii as a function of both NaCl concentration and pH.; (A) B. subtilis cotA; (B) B. clausii cotA; (C) Intersection at 400 mM NaCl and (D) intersection at 1000 mM NaCl, with B. clausii cotA in full lines and B. subtilis cotA in broken lines.; To further confirm the estimates of the alkali-tolerance of the proteins, the intersections at 400 mM NaCl and 1000 mM NaCl are shown in Figures 5C and 5D, respectively.; Heat activation is common for laccases, but for B. clausii we also observed similar effect from high pH incubation and NaCl.;  Since NaCl activation occurred in combination with pH activation, it is possible that high ionic strength may destabilize labile salt bridges to give a similar response, but understanding the complex interplay of temperature, pH and salt on activation-inhibition of laccases clearly requires more mechanistic investigations.;  We also identify important, pH-dependent effects of buffers, auto-oxidation, thermal activation, and non-competitive substrate inhibition that, together with the general changes in relative redox potentials of substrates and laccases, confirm and expand the previously noted [60] complex behavior of these enzymes under variable pH and NaCl concentration."
"copper","D003300",24915287,4051777," This resistance is possibly caused by two substitutions (S427Q and V110E) that could repel anions to reduce anion-copper interactions at the expense of catalytic proficiency, a trade-off of potential relevance to laccase optimization.; Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2, p-diphenol dioxygen oxidoreductases) belong to the class of multi-copper oxidases, characterized by four redox-active copper ions organized into three spectrally distinct sites (T1, T2, and T3).; Protein expression was carried out in semi-anaerobic conditions [40], which have been shown to enhance copper loading into cotA type laccases.;  The T2 copper site is visible through the open channel.;  Laccases use oxygen as co-substrate and produce water, both of which need to be transported via channels to the interior T2/or T3 copper sites, and thus variations in these part of the proteins could affect turnover.;  This finding confirms that the performance of cotA from B. clausii at higher pH is enhanced by activity associated with the copper sites, not the substrate binding step, and is consistent with an enhanced ability to prevent anion inhibition.;  From Michaelis Menten analysis, we found that the alkaline activity shift of the new cotA is not due to KM but mainly to kcat, suggesting changes at the copper sites rather than the T1/substrate binding sites."

The immunopharmacological effects of exopolymers, β-1,3/1,6-glucans, have been reported by in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies as well [29]. The key immunological features include anti-tumor activity [30], radioprotective actions [31], increased host resistance to microbial infections [32], as well as adjuvant effects [33]. In addition, exopolysaccharides isolated from Aureobasidium pullulans (EAP) contain 13% β-1,3/1,6-glucan [34, 35] as a major ingredient.; It has been reported that the various pharmacological effects of natural products are synergistically increased by appropriate mixed formulations [9, 44–46]. Specifically, the bone-preserving characteristics of EAP have been potentiated by combining it with other active agents [47–49]. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the mixed formulations of exopolymer (EAP) and leaf extracts of TM (EAP:TM) might show favorable synergistic anti-osteoporotic properties due to enhanced availability of the bioactive substances.; In this study, we aimed to investigate the optimal compositions of EAP:TM mixtures that are associated with clear synergistic anti-osteoporotic potential compared with the single formulations, using bilateral OVX female mice, a renowned rodent model for studying human osteoporosis [7, 9].;  OVX: Bilateral ovariectomy; RES: Risedronate sodium; EAP: Exopolymers purified from A. pullulans SM2001; TM: T. morbifera leaf extracts; (EAP:TM): Mixed formula consisted of EAP and TM (g/g); EAP, an extracellular polymer isolated from A. pullulans (SM-2001; marketed as Polycan™) and the standard leaf extract of T. morbifera (TM) were obtained from Glucan Corp., Busan, Rep. of Korea.;  EAP consisted of 40% total β-glucans including 13% β-1,3/1,6-glucans [34, 35]. EAP and TM were mixed thoroughly in distilled water to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml.;  A few samples of TM [Code No: TM2016Ku01], and EAP [Code No: EAP2016Ku01] were deposited in the herbarium, Medical Research Center for Globalization of Herbal Formulation, Daegu Haany University, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Gyeongsan-si, Rep. of Korea.;  The 9 different herbal formulations at a final concentration of 200 mg/kg/body weight (EAP:TM = 1:1, 1:3, 1:5, 1:7, 1:9, 3:1, 5:1, 7:1, and 9:1) and both single formulations of TM and EAP were supplied orally, once a day for 35 days after 35 days of OVX surgery.;  The EAP:TM mixed formulations (1:1, 1:3, 1:5, 1:7, 1:9, 3:1, 5:1, 7:1, and 9:1) were prepared by dissolving EAP and TM (100:100, 50:150, 33:167, 25:175, 20:180, 150:50, 167:33, 175:25, and 180:20 mg:mg) in distilled water, respectively (final concentration: 200 mg in 10 ml of distilled water).;  The single formulations of EAP and TM were also prepared and administrated in the same manner as other mixed formulations of EAP and TM.;  Although, obvious decreases in body weights were noticed during some periods of treatment with EAP:TM 1:1, 1:5, 3:1, and 7:1 as compared with the OVX-mice; animals treated with all EAP and TM formulations showed significant (p < 0.01) decreases in body weight gains.;  Specifically, EAP:TM (3:1) treated OVX mice revealed significant (p < 0.05) reductions in body weight gains as compared with mice treated with other formulations.;

 However, a dramatic increase in bone structure and mass of cortical and trabecular bones was observed for all the tested formulations; especially, EAP:TM (3:1) treated groups showed a visible inhibition in the bone mass loss of femur and the histopathological activation of osteoclast cells than the other treatment groups (Tables 4 and ​and5;5;

p < 0.05) inhibited the decreases in bone structure and mass.;  In particular, EAP:TM (3:1)-treated mice showed significantly (p < 0.01) increased inhibition of bone mass depletion and destruction of structures induced by OVX.;  However, the stimulation and escalation of osteoclast cells was significantly (p < 0.01) repressed by treatment with all EAP:TM formulations including the single formulations; particularly, EAP:TM 3:1-treated groups consistently exhibited significant (p < 0.01) increases in the inhibition of osteoclast cell activation and proliferation.; T. morbifera has traditionally been used as an ingredient in preparing medicine and tea for various pharmacological purposes [16–18]. The bone-preserving properties of exopolysaccharide (EAP) have been potentiated by combining it with other active agents [47–49]. Therefore, we expected that appropriate combinations of EAP and TM would demonstrate promising synergistic anti-osteoporotic activities due to the increased availability of the bioactive substances.;  During this experiment, we used bilateral OVX mice, a renowned rodent model for studying human osteoporosis [7–9], to observe the synergistic anti-osteoporotic potential of mixtures containing different proportions of EAP and TM compared with that of the single formulation of each herbal extract.;  The EAP:TM mixtures in the present study, significantly (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05) increased anti-osteoporotic activity compared to single formulations of EAP or TM, providing evidence for the synergistic effects of combining these two herbal extracts.;  However, these OVX-induced estrogen-deficient osteoporotic signs relating to decreases in bone formation and increases in bone turnover were considerably inhibited by 35 days of continuous oral application with single formulations of EAP or TM, as well as all 9 mixtures of EAP:TM, particularly, EAP:TM (3:1) formulation.;  These outcomes of this study advocate that the EAP:TM (3:1) mixture synergistically enhanced the distinctive anti-osteoporotic effects of the single formulations, likely due to the increased availability of the bioactive substances.; The results of the present study were comparable to those of RES (2.5 mg/kg) treatment in this experiment, which suggest that the EAP:TM formulation 3:1 might act as a potent new agent for curing osteoporosis in menopausal women.;  The observed serum bALP activity and cortical and trabecular bone thickness were consistent with previously reported results [14, 15]. In one condition of the current experiment, EAP:TM 3:1 showed slightly lower antiresorptive effects compared to RES (2.5 mg/kg).;  However, EAP:TM 3:1 exhibited effects on bone formation, which were not observed with RES 2.5 mg/kg treatment.;  Hence, EAP:TM 3:1 demonstrated favorable anti-osteoporotic effects in OVX mice that were comparable to RES (2.5 mg/kg) treatment.;  Lorden and Caudle (1986) as well as Bain et al. (1993) reported increases in body weight after OVX [55, 56], while other studies failed to report the same [57, 58]. Generally, decreases in body weight or weight gain have been considered a sign of toxicity in normal states but in disease states, such as obesity, it is regarded as a favorable sign [7, 9]. During this study, noteworthy decreases in bodyweight gains were observed in all mice treated with EAP:TM formulations, particularly in EAP:TM 3:1-formulation.;  In particular, EAP:TM 3:1-formulation displayed significant increase in femur absolute and relative ash and dry weights, as well as wet-weights.;  Hence, the inhibitory effects of TM or EAP single formulations on OVX-induced decreases of bone weights were synergistically enhanced by the EAP:TM 3:1 combination.;  However, all EAP:TM single or mixed formulations and especially, mice treated with EAP:TM 3:1-formualtion showed increases in serum bALP activity and decreases in osteocalcin levels.;  Nevertheless, marked increases in femur Ca and IP levels were noticed in all mice administered the test materials, including EAP:TM 1:1, compared with that in OVX control mice.;  In particular, EAP:TM 3:1-treated mice also revealed marked increases in Ca and IP contents in the right femur.;  However, test material-administered groups including those treated with the EAP single formulation, showed noteworthy increases in femur FL and mean BMD, and total body.;  Especially, EAP:TM 3:1 (g/g)-treated mice showed significant enhancement in femur mean BMD, total body and femur strength as compared to those of EAP or TM single formulations.;  This could be attributed to the inhibition of osteoclast cell activity by EAP and TM.;  In particular, EAP:TM 3:1-treated mice showed greater inhibition of the histopathological reduction in osteoclast activation and femur bone mass compared to mice administered with the TM or EAP single formulations.; The findings of the present study clearly indicated the favorable synergistic effects of EAP:TM (3:1) formulation on bone turnover and formation in OVX-induced metabolic disorder.; In this study, a continuous oral administration of the single and/or combined formulations of EAP and TM significantly inhibited the OVX-induced osteoporotic symptoms i.e., decreased formation and increased turnover of bone.;  In particular, compared with the single formulations, the EAP:TM (3:1) mixture revealed significantly favorable inhibition of estrogen-deficient osteoporosis indices.;  In the conditions of the current experiment, EAP:TM (3:1) formulation showed slightly lower antiresorptive effects than RES 2.5 mg/kg; however, EAP:TM 3:1 demonstrated bone formation effects, which were not observed with RES 2.5 mg/kg treatment.;  These findings are considered direct and reliable proof that the EAP:TM 3:1 mixed formulation synergistically enhanced the distinct anti-osteoporotic potential of the single EAP or TM formulations, which might be due to the enhanced availability of the bioactive substances.;  Hence, EAP:TM 3:1 mixture might act as a potent new agent for curing osteoporosis in menopausal women.;  OVX: Bilateral ovariectomy; RES: Risedronate sodium; EAP: Exopolymers purified from A. pullulans SM2001; TM: T. morbifera leaf extracts; (EAP:TM): Mixed formula consisted of EAP and TM (g/g).;  OVX: Bilateral ovariectomy; RES: Risedronate sodium; EAP: Exopolymers purified from A. pullulans SM2001; TM: T. morbifera leaf extracts; (EAP:TM): Mixed formula consisted of EAP and TM (g/g).;  OVX: Bilateral ovariectomy; RES: Risedronate sodium; EAP: Exopolymers purified from A. pullulans SM2001; TM: T. morbifera leaf extracts; (EAP:TM): Mixed formula consisted of EAP and TM (g/g).;  All single and mixed formula consisted of EAP and TM were administered at a dose level of totalized 200 mg/kg by gastric gavage.

 Furthermore, the transformed Escherichia coli and Synechococcus strains expressing four putative Aphanothece MAA genes under the control of a native promoter were found to be capable of synthesizing mycosporine-2-glycine.;  The accumulation level of mycosporine-2-glycine was again higher under the high-salinity condition.;  The product of Ava_3856 catalyzes the addition of glycine to 4-DG to produce mycosporine-glycine.;  Further condensation of serine onto mycosporine-glycine yields shinorine, which is catalyzed by the product of Ava_3855 encoding a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS).; For cyanobacteria, shinorine, porphyra-334, and mycosporine-glycine are often described as the major MAAs (2).;  This finding is remarkable because organisms living in the hypersaline environment often accumulate an osmoprotectant, glycine betaine (5).;  If halophilic cyanobacteria accumulate both glycine betaine and MAAs, they require a large amount of nitrogenous compounds.; A halotolerant cyanobacterium, Aphanothece halophytica, accumulates glycine betaine as an osmoprotectant and can grow under high-salinity conditions up to 3 M NaCl and alkaline pH 11 (10).;  A. halophytica synthesizes glycine betaine by a three-step methylation of glycine (11).;  Since both glycine betaine and MAAs are nitrogenous compounds, it was interesting to examine whether A. halophytica can synthesize the MAAs.;  In this study, we demonstrated that A. halophytica accumulates an MAA, mycosporine-2-glycine.;  Moreover, we found that E. coli and Synechococcus cells transformed with the identified four putative Aphanothece genes under the control of their native promoters were capable of synthesizing mycosporine-2-glycine.;  The mass of this observation at peak 303.02 was in agreement with the mass of the protonated form of mycosporine-2-glycine, implying that the detected MAA is likely mycosporine-2-glycine.;  The signal peak at 259 was in agreement with the protonated form of decarboxylated product of mycosporine-2-glycine, and the signal peak 176.88 might be sodium salt of gentisic acid.; Furthermore, amino acid composition analysis revealed the presence of only a single amino acid corresponding to glycine (Fig. 1C).;  Thus, glycine can be considered the sole amino acid in the structure of the Ap-MAA molecule.;  Hence, we concluded that the purified Ap-MAA is mycosporine-2-glycine.;  For instance, A. halophytica has evolved a unique biosynthetic pathway for glycine betaine via glycine methylation, not the choline oxidation which occurs in most organisms (11).;  The transfer of A. halophytica glycine betaine biosynthetic genes resulted in much higher glycine betaine biosynthesis and conferred greater salt tolerance on the freshwater S. elongatus PCC 7942 and nitrogen-fixing Anabaena sp.;  Using HPLC, amino acid, and TOF-MS analyses, mycosporine-2-glycine was identified in A. halophytica (Fig. 1).;  It has been reported that shinorine, mycosporine-glycine, porphyra-334, and asterina-330 were the most abundant MAAs found in freshwater and marine cyanobacteria (2, 20).;  To date, mycosporine-2-glycine has been identified as the major MAA only in the halophilic cyanobacterium Euhalothece (21), marine organisms such as the sea slug Aplysia dactylomela (22), and the green sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (23).;  The reason for the occurrence of mycosporine-2-glycine in halophilic strains remains unknown.; Expression of Ap-MAA genes in E. coli produced mycosporine-2-glycine as a main MAA, whereas the expression of MAA synthesis genes of Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 produced shinorine as the main MAA (7, 8).;  Accumulation of different MAAs, shinorine in Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 and Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 and mycosporine-2-glycine in A. halophytica, is interesting and needs to be discussed in relation to the homology of MAA synthesis genes.; The second gene encodes an O-MT catalyzing the methylation of DDG to 4-DG, while the third gene encodes a C-N ligase catalyzing the addition of glycine to 4-DG to form mycosporine-glycine.;  Mycosporine-glycine is believed to be the precursor of shinorine and mycosporine-2-glycine (8).; Recently, a fourth gene has been shown to catalyze the condensation of serine onto mycosporine-glycine, yielding shinorine for both Ava_3856 encoding NRPS and NpF5597 encoding d-Ala-d-Ala ligase (7, 8).;  The A. halophytica Ap-AAligase gene is homologous to that of Nostoc, NpF5597, but the product was different, shinorine for NpF5597 and mycosporine-2-glycine for the Ap-AAligase gene.;  This finding suggests that the substrate specificities of NpF5597 and the Ap-AAligase gene are different, namely, the condensation of serine onto mycosporine-glycine for NpF5597 and condensation of glycine onto mycosporine-glycine for the Ap-AAligase gene.;  However, our in vivo analysis showed that the accumulation of mycosporine-2-glycine was stimulated more under high salinity rather than under UV-B exposure (Fig. 2B).;  A. halophytica is a halotolerant cyanobacterium and accumulates a large amount of glycine betaine under high-salinity conditions such as 2.5 M NaCl.;  Glycine betaine is synthesized from glycine by a three-step methylation (11).;  Therefore, significant production of glycine is required in A. halophytica cells under high-salinity conditions.;  Molecular mechanisms of regulation of biosynthesis of glycine betaine and mycosporine-2-glycine are interesting topics for further investigation and clarification.;  In this study, we have successfully generated E. coli and Synechococcus strains to produce mycosporine-2-glycine via the introduction of A. halophytica MAA biosynthetic genes.;  Among them, a native Aphanothece promoter seems to be most suitable for high accumulation of mycosporine-2-glycine.;  Heterologous expression in E. coli showed the significant increase of mycosporine-2-glycine under salt stress (Fig. 5).;  In Synechococcus, we could detect the expression of Ap-DDG by Western blotting with a similar trend as in E. coli (data not shown), but the product mycosporine-2-glycine was less produced (Fig. 5)."

(A) Ap-MAA accumulation under salt upshock (0.5 M to 2.5 M NaCl). (B) Ap-MAA accumulation under UV-B radiation.; The mRNA accumulation of the Ap-DDG, Ap-OMT, Ap-CNligase, and Ap-AAligase genes was examined in A. halophytica cells prepared under the salt upshock condition.;  Expression of the four genes was found to be induced by salt upshock.;  An increase up to 8-fold was found for the Ap-DDG gene, while 4-, 3.5-, and 3-fold increases were observed for the Ap-OMT, Ap-CNligase, and Ap-AAligase genes, respectively, after salt upshock for 6 h.; The extremophilic cyanobacterium A. halophytica exists in highly salty and alkaline environments.;  The transfer of A. halophytica glycine betaine biosynthetic genes resulted in much higher glycine betaine biosynthesis and conferred greater salt tolerance on the freshwater S. elongatus PCC 7942 and nitrogen-fixing Anabaena sp.;  Therefore, the present results support the notion that MAAs can play a role not only as an UV-absorbing compound but also as an osmoprotectant in response to salt stress (5).;  Heterologous expression in E. coli showed the significant increase of mycosporine-2-glycine under salt stress (Fig. 5)."

This inefficiency is probably due to a very low P/O ratio as well as to the other difficulties posed by its extreme environment.;  Despite this however, we also found that Natronomonas pharaonis is only able to incorporate a very small fraction of the total carbon that it consumes (approximately 35%), likely in no small part due to the difficulties posed by its environment.;  Two strains of Natronomonas pharaonis have been described so far: strain Gabara from lake Gabara in Egypt (DSM 2160) [1], which was used in this study, and strain SP1 from lake Magadi in Kenya (DSM 3395) [2].

[21].; The total organic carbon content of the biomass was measured at different optical densities.;  We calculated a linear correlation of 18.22.6 mmol of carbon per ODL.; Determination of the total organic carbon content of the biomass is only the first step.; The amount of amino acids in the biomass added up to about 335 mg/ODL, which represents approximately 75% of the total organic mass or 80% of the total organic carbon content.;  Finally, the remaining amount of organic mass (from the total organic carbon analysis) was assumed to comprise of nucleotides (approximately 20%).;  However, in the course of optimizing the carbon sources supplied in the medium, which we undertook in the interest of designing stable isotope experiments, we observed that the haloalkaliphile was able to grow on a medium that contained just acetate.;  Nevertheless, it is now clear that Natronomonas pharaonis is capable of growing (aerobically) on a single carbon source.;  Note that all of the carbon (acetate) taken up by cells will have to be either: (1) incorporated into the biomass; (2) secreted as the respiratory byproduct CO; or (3) secreted as some other metabolite after conversion.;  Accordingly, if the acetate to oxygen consumption ratio is too high, enough energy that would allow any distribution of the consumed carbon into the possible fates simply cannot be generated.;  Thus, increasing the amount of energy needed to produce a unit of biomass means that a greater fraction of the consumed carbon (acetate) will have to be converted into energy.; We mentioned earlier that all of the carbon consumed by cells will have one of the following three fates: (1) incorporated into the biomass; (2) secreted as the respiratory byproduct CO; or (3) secreted as some other metabolite after conversion.;  Given that only acetate was supplied in the medium, then the only other possible way through which the cells could incorporate carbon is through CO fixation.;  Specifically, we supplied 13C sodium carbonate in the medium, and then tried to see if label would turn up in amino acids (which represent 75% of the biomass).;  Accordingly, the amount of acetate that disappears from the medium is a direct measure of the total carbon consumption of the cells (i.e., two carbon atoms per acetate molecule).;  By correlating this consumption, which is represented as “total uptake” (red borken curve) in Figure 5, with the total amount of carbon in the biomass (see Analysis of biomass composition), we find that only about 35% of the total carbon consumed was incorporated into the cells (i.e., fate 1; blue curve in Figure 5).;  This very low carbon efficiency is likely due to a very small P/O ratio as well as to the other difficulties presented by the extreme environments of the microorganism.; 
Natronomonas pharaonis was grown on the single carbon source, acetate.;  Accordingly, the total amount of carbon that has been consumed (red curve) is simply twice the amount of acetate that has disappeared from the medium.;  Accordingly, the delta region (red shaded) between total carbon consumption (red curve) and the sum of both fates (green curve) represents carbon that was consumed but not accounted for by incorportion or respiration.;  While this delta region could potentially be due to carbon being secreted in some other form, it is more likely that this difference is due to small methodological inaccuracies (see text for more details), and that incorporation and respiration fully account for carbon consumption.;  Under the conditions used, Natronomonas pharaonis showed a very low carbon incorporation rate of approximately 35%.;  We found respiratory-related CO production to account for about 63% of the total carbon consumption.; The sum of fates 1 (incorporation) and 2 (CO production) is plotted (green curve) in Figure 5 to provide a comparison with the total carbon consumption (red curve).;  Clearly, the difference between this sum and the total carbon consumption corresponds to material that was consumed but neither incorported into the biomass nor oxidized to CO.;  While this relatively small difference, which is represented in the figure by the red shaded region, could potentially be due to carbon being secreted in some other form (i.e., fate 3), it is more likely to simply be due to small methodological inaccuracies, such as deviations in the actual RER ratio or errors in the measurements.;  That is, under the conditions used, biomass incorporation and CO production together likely fully account for carbon consumption.;  For example, while genetic transformation was possible for Halobacterium salinarum, the microorganism required multiple carbon sources in the medium, and this complicated other protocols such as stable isotope labeling.;  These include a characterization of the biomass composition, and a quantification of carbon and oxygen consumption under typical conditions.;  The data was integrated with the metabolic reconstruction to create a computational model that we used to analyze the behavior of Natronomonas pharaonis when grown on a single carbon source.;  We also found that the archaeon has a very low carbon efficiency of only about 35%, likely due to a very low P/O ratio and the other difficulties brought about by the haloalkaliphilic character of its environment.;  For this reason, one of the things that we are currently working on is to add carbon fate data to the metabolic network reconstruction.;  In particular, we tested different carbon sources, including all of the amino acids, acetate, glycerol, citrate cycle intermediates, and combinations thereof, in different concentrations using 96-well microtiterplates (Greiner bio-one).; The total organic carbon (TOC) content of the Natronomonas pharaonis biomass was determined by adapting a procedure typically used to determe the TOC of soils.;  Once cooled to room temperature, the remaining amount of KCrO (added with Solution 2), which oxidizes the organic carbon in the biomass, was then determined via titration with Solution 3.;  This value is inversely related to the amount of carbon in the biomass."
"oxygen","D010100",20543878,2881530," In addition, we experimentally determined several parameters relevant to growth, including a characterization of the biomass composition and a quantification of carbon and oxygen consumption.;  Results of the analysis include the finding that Natronomonas pharaonis, when grown aerobically on acetate, uses a carbon to oxygen consumption ratio that is theoretically near-optimal with respect to growth and energy production.; Genome-scale models of metabolism have been constructed and analyzed for various organisms [6], yielding interesting results, such as the prediction of E. coli metabolic mutant phenotypes up to an accuracy of 86% [17], a simulation and characterization of E. coli's secreted metabolites under various nutrient and oxygenation conditions [14], a study of the methanogenic growth of M. barkeri
[18], and an analysis of growth on a relatively complex medium for L. plantarum
[19] and Halobacterium salinarum
[20], [21]. In this work, we present a manually curated, genome-scale metabolic reconstruction for Natronomonas pharaonis, and report on the development and use of a constraints-based model from it.; In order to simulate aerobic growth on acetate using the constraints-based model, three parameters needed to be further defined: (1) the consumption rate of acetate, (2) the consumption rate of oxygen, and (3) the maintenance energy.;  Accordingly, for most of the analysis we could simplify the calculations by reducing the parameter space to just two instead of three; namely, the acetate to oxygen consumption ratio and the maintenance energy.; The theoretical maximum level of growth as a function of the acetate∶oxygen parameter and the maintenance energy is plotted in Figure 4.;  It is immediately recognizable from the figure that growth is not possible for a very high (7∶3) or a very low (3∶7) acetate to oxygen consumption ratio.;  Accordingly, if the acetate to oxygen consumption ratio is too high, enough energy that would allow any distribution of the consumed carbon into the possible fates simply cannot be generated.;  In an analogous way, a very low acetate to oxygen consumption ratio is also impossible because under such conditions, there is not enough organic material that can be oxidized in order to allow the conversion of all the consumed oxygen to HO.; The surface represents the theoretical maximum growth of Natronomonas pharaonis as a function of two parameters: (1) the acetate to oxygen ratio and (2) the maintenance energy (in mol ATP per ODml).;  The green shaded region corresponds to experimentally observed values of the former (i.e., acetate∶oxygen), while the orange shaded region corresponds to experimentally determined values of the latter (i.e., maintenance energy).;  Clearly, for different values of the maintenance energy, theoretical maximum growth is achieved at different acetate to oxygen ratios.; Optimal acetate to oxygen consumption ratios as a function of the maintenance energy are shown in Figure 4 using the red broken curve (see also figure inset).;  Notice that as the maintenance energy parameter is increased, the optimal acetate to oxygen ratio decreases.;  In addition, oxidization of a greater amount of acetate would require a greater amount of oxygen, and this also decreases the optimal ratio.;  During the early stages of growth, we observed an acetate∶oxygen comsumption ratio of about . This is represented in Figure 4 by the green shaded region.;  In addition, we also approximated the maintenance energy by calculating the amount of oxygen consumed per unit increase in population size (optical density), and then multiplying the result with a P∶O ratio of 1∶1.;  Because of the relatively scarce information available for Natronomonas pharaonis, the P∶O ratio that we used to calculate the maintenance energy above is actually the experimental value for the closely related Halobacterium salinarum, which was determined using oxygen pulse experiments [29], [30]. Thus, the maintenance energy value reported above is still subject to scaling.; The intersection of the regions corresponding to the experimentally determined values of the acetate to oxygen consumption ratio (green region in Figure 4) and the maintenance energy (orange region) could be thought of as the area representing experimentally observed growth behavior (shaded yellow in the figure).;  This means that the cells must be using an acetate to oxygen consumption ratio that is at least near-optimal with respect to growth and energy production (90% based on theoretical calculations), whatever the actual maintenance energy may be.;  We used this fact to approximate the CO production of our cultures, specifically by multiplying the experimentally determined oxygen consumption with it.;  These include a characterization of the biomass composition, and a quantification of carbon and oxygen consumption under typical conditions.;  Among other results, we found that the archeaon, when grown aerobically on acetate, uses an acetate to oxygen consumption ratio that is theoretically near-optimal with respect to growth and energy production.; where  is a vector of fluxes defining the flux  through each reaction ,  is the objective function,  is the set of reversible internal reactions,  is the set of irreversible internal reactions,  is the set of exchange fluxes associated with ubiquitous metabolites, and  is the set of exchange fluxes that correspond to metabolites that were treated as parameters during analysis (e.g., acetate and oxygen uptake).; In the analysis of growth with respect to the acetate∶oxygen consumption ratio and the maintenance energy, Equation 1 was solved for different combinations of the two parameters using the growth reaction as objective function (see Analysis of biomass composition).;  Specifically, the acetate∶oxygen consumption ratio was allowed to vary from 1∶9 to 9∶1, and the maintenance energy was allowed to vary from 0 to 100 mol ATP per ODml.;  Oxygen saturation in the medium was monitored using the “Fibox 3-trace v3, fiber-optic oxygen meter” from Precision Sensing GmbH (Regensburg, Germany).;  Details on the calculation of actual oxygen consumption are provided as supplementary information (Text S1)."
"acetate","D000085",20543878,2881530," Results of the analysis include the finding that Natronomonas pharaonis, when grown aerobically on acetate, uses a carbon to oxygen consumption ratio that is theoretically near-optimal with respect to growth and energy production.;  Two strains of Natronomonas pharaonis have been described so far: strain Gabara from lake Gabara in Egypt (DSM 2160) [1], which was used in this study, and strain SP1 from lake Magadi in Kenya (DSM 3395) [2]. Among other results, we show that the microorganism is able to grow on a single carbon source, such as acetate, glutamate and pyruvate, unlike the more well-studied halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum.;  However, in the course of optimizing the carbon sources supplied in the medium, which we undertook in the interest of designing stable isotope experiments, we observed that the haloalkaliphile was able to grow on a medium that contained just acetate.;  Indeed, although the rest of this study deals with growth on acetate, we were able to find other possible substrates, including glutamate and pyruvate.; In order to simulate aerobic growth on acetate using the constraints-based model, three parameters needed to be further defined: (1) the consumption rate of acetate, (2) the consumption rate of oxygen, and (3) the maintenance energy.;  Under certain assumptions however (see Computational Analysis for details on the calculations), it turns out that what is critical to the first two parameters with respect to the analysis is just the ratio between the two, i.e., the ratio between acetate and oxgyen usage.;  Accordingly, for most of the analysis we could simplify the calculations by reducing the parameter space to just two instead of three; namely, the acetate to oxygen consumption ratio and the maintenance energy.; The theoretical maximum level of growth as a function of the acetate∶oxygen parameter and the maintenance energy is plotted in Figure 4.;  It is immediately recognizable from the figure that growth is not possible for a very high (7∶3) or a very low (3∶7) acetate to oxygen consumption ratio.;  In the case where the ratio is too high, i.e., too much acetate, energy cannot be produced in amounts sufficient to process all of the consumed material.;  Note that all of the carbon (acetate) taken up by cells will have to be either: (1) incorporated into the biomass; (2) secreted as the respiratory byproduct CO; or (3) secreted as some other metabolite after conversion.;  Accordingly, if the acetate to oxygen consumption ratio is too high, enough energy that would allow any distribution of the consumed carbon into the possible fates simply cannot be generated.;  In an analogous way, a very low acetate to oxygen consumption ratio is also impossible because under such conditions, there is not enough organic material that can be oxidized in order to allow the conversion of all the consumed oxygen to HO.; The surface represents the theoretical maximum growth of Natronomonas pharaonis as a function of two parameters: (1) the acetate to oxygen ratio and (2) the maintenance energy (in mol ATP per ODml).;  The green shaded region corresponds to experimentally observed values of the former (i.e., acetate∶oxygen), while the orange shaded region corresponds to experimentally determined values of the latter (i.e., maintenance energy).;  Clearly, for different values of the maintenance energy, theoretical maximum growth is achieved at different acetate to oxygen ratios.; Optimal acetate to oxygen consumption ratios as a function of the maintenance energy are shown in Figure 4 using the red broken curve (see also figure inset).;  Notice that as the maintenance energy parameter is increased, the optimal acetate to oxygen ratio decreases.;  This is because under the conditions used, energy can only be derived through the oxidation of acetate.;  Thus, increasing the amount of energy needed to produce a unit of biomass means that a greater fraction of the consumed carbon (acetate) will have to be converted into energy.;  In addition, oxidization of a greater amount of acetate would require a greater amount of oxygen, and this also decreases the optimal ratio.;  Accordingly, we prepared actual cultures where we grew the archaeon aerobically on acetate.;  During the early stages of growth, we observed an acetate∶oxygen comsumption ratio of about . This is represented in Figure 4 by the green shaded region.; The intersection of the regions corresponding to the experimentally determined values of the acetate to oxygen consumption ratio (green region in Figure 4) and the maintenance energy (orange region) could be thought of as the area representing experimentally observed growth behavior (shaded yellow in the figure).;  This means that the cells must be using an acetate to oxygen consumption ratio that is at least near-optimal with respect to growth and energy production (90% based on theoretical calculations), whatever the actual maintenance energy may be.;  Given that only acetate was supplied in the medium, then the only other possible way through which the cells could incorporate carbon is through CO fixation.;  Accordingly, the amount of acetate that disappears from the medium is a direct measure of the total carbon consumption of the cells (i.e., two carbon atoms per acetate molecule).; 
Natronomonas pharaonis was grown on the single carbon source, acetate.;  Accordingly, the total amount of carbon that has been consumed (red curve) is simply twice the amount of acetate that has disappeared from the medium.;  In the case of acetate (and some sugars in general), the RER is typically close to one.;  Among other results, we found that the archeaon, when grown aerobically on acetate, uses an acetate to oxygen consumption ratio that is theoretically near-optimal with respect to growth and energy production.; Stable isotope labeling of small-molecules (e.g., C-acetate in this case) is a powerful tool for characterizing metabolic pathways.; where  is a vector of fluxes defining the flux  through each reaction ,  is the objective function,  is the set of reversible internal reactions,  is the set of irreversible internal reactions,  is the set of exchange fluxes associated with ubiquitous metabolites, and  is the set of exchange fluxes that correspond to metabolites that were treated as parameters during analysis (e.g., acetate and oxygen uptake).; In the analysis of growth with respect to the acetate∶oxygen consumption ratio and the maintenance energy, Equation 1 was solved for different combinations of the two parameters using the growth reaction as objective function (see Analysis of biomass composition).;  Specifically, the acetate∶oxygen consumption ratio was allowed to vary from 1∶9 to 9∶1, and the maintenance energy was allowed to vary from 0 to 100 mol ATP per ODml.;  In particular, we tested different carbon sources, including all of the amino acids, acetate, glycerol, citrate cycle intermediates, and combinations thereof, in different concentrations using 96-well microtiterplates (Greiner bio-one)."
"metal","D008670",26543264,4627947," It constitutes an example of the communities adapted to live in extreme conditions caused by dryness and metal concentrations
.; The hyperarid Atacama Desert stretches for more than 1000 km, along the coast of northern Chile from the Pacific Ocean to the western slopes of the Andes [1]. The extreme dryness, salinity, hydrothermalism, oxidizing conditions and toxic metal concentrations make the Atacama Desert a unique ecosystem of extreme environmental settings, inhospitable to most living species [2]. Indeed, these soils are considered Mars-like and offer an ideal setting to investigate the application of life detection systems [3]."
"water","D014867",19840102,2810447," Whereas the functional biosphere may primarily be constrained by water activity (aw) the mechanism(s) by which this occurs have not been fully elucidated.;  Remarkably we found that, for diverse species of xerophilic fungi at aw values of ≤ 0.72, water activity per se did not limit cellular function.;  We provide evidence that chaotropic activity determined their biotic window, and obtained mycelial growth at water activities as low as 0.647 (below that recorded for any microbial species) by addition of compounds that reduced the net chaotropicity.; Xerophilic fungi are more tolerant to water stress than any other organism; mycelial growth of one species has been previously recorded down to a water activity of 0.656 (Pitt and Christian, 1968).;  Furthermore, the substantial fungal biomass of soils in semiarid regions (Smith et al., 1992; Rutz and Kieft, 2004) can act as nutrient and water reservoirs in water-constrained ecosystems (Ruiz and Azcon, 1995; Austin et al., 2004; Kashangura et al., 2006; Collins et al., 2008).;  However, such solute activities have not been studied either at ultra-low water activities (≤ 0.8; see Hallsworth et al., 2007), or in xerophilic fungi.;  We therefore suspected that water activity is not a definitive parameter that dictates the limits of microbial activity in all environmental niches.;  We carried out this study of xerophiles, obtained from diverse sources, to test the hypothesis that water activity does not always act as the barrier to microbial and, by implication, biosphere function in high-solute environments.;  Here we show that in low water-activity environments that are hostile to life (≤ 0.72 aw), water activity per se did not limit microbial activity; and provide evidence that cellular function was determined by the net effect of other environmental parameters (including chaotropic and kosmotropic activities) that impact on macromolecule structure-function.; For all environmental isolates and the named xerophile species (157 strains in total; see Tables 1 and ​and2)2) rates of hyphal extension were determined on low water-activity media containing one of a range of chemically diverse but biologically relevant solutes (see Fig. 1A and B).;  Generally strains from low-solute substrates grew down to similar water activities, and at comparable growth rates, to those from high-solute environments (data not shown).;  By contrast, glycerol facilitated growth down to the lowest water-activity for more than 75% of strains (Fig. 1B) so we used glycerol-supplemented media to test the hypothesis that the stress parameter water activity does not always limit life on low water-activity substrates.; Stress tolerance of xerophilic fungi to (A and B) single stressors and (C–I) temperature : water-activity regimes.;  Proportion of the 157 fungal strains tested (see Tables 1 and ​and2)2) that (A) grew optimally and (B) grew to their water-activity minimum on media containing either no added solute (control) or those supplemented with ethanol, NaCl, ethylene glycol, glycerol, MgCl2, fructose, sucrose or PEG 400.;  For C–K: growth profiles for the nine most xerophilic fungi incubated at 15, 20, 25, 30 and 37°C on glycerol-supplemented media [water-activity values ranged from 0.810 to 0.653; isopleth contours indicate growth rates (mm day−1)] and were plotted using Sigmaplot, Version 8.0.;  Mycelial growth rates of these strains were quantified on glycerol-supplemented media over a matrix of temperature and water-activity values (Fig. 1C–K) in order to determine the limits of their biotic windows, and to obtain two-dimensional profiles of their growth phenotypes.;  We then determined the pH required for optimum growth over a range of water-activity values on glycerol-supplemented media in order to avoid inadvertently causing pH limitation.;  There were clear phenotypic differences between strains, but growth at low water activity was generally optimal at 30°C (see Fig. 1C–K) and pH 5.75 (data not shown) so these conditions were used throughout the study.;  Although hyphal growth has previously been recorded at ≤ 0.710 aw (see Pitt and Christian, 1968; see later), only two strains grew on glycerol media at water-activity values significantly below 0.714 aw, regardless of temperature or pH (see Fig. 1J and K).;  However, our data as well as earlier studies suggest that glycerol has inhibitory activities at molar concentrations (see Fig. 1J and K; Borowitz and Brown, 1974; Hallsworth et al., 2007), and may act as a chaotropic stressor due to its unusual interactions with water and destabilizing effects on macromolecular structures (Borowitz and Brown, 1974; Hallsworth et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2009; F.D.L.;  We therefore formulated the hypothesis that solute activities other than water activity can determine the limits of microbial-cell function.; To test this hypothesis, we designed a range of 14 low water-activity media that were supplemented with either a chaotropic solute (fructose or glycerol) or combinations of glycerol and a number of other solutes: fructose and/or the kosmotropes sucrose, glucose, NaCl and KCl (Collins, 1997; Galinski et al., 1997; see Table 3 and Fig. 2A–I).;  A number of recent studies provide evidence that some ions can penetrate the hydrophobic domains of macromolecular systems by shedding their hydration water and that, via their physical bulk, they disorder the tertiary/quaternary structure (see Sachs and Woolf, 2003), i.e. that – by our earlier definition – they act chaotropically.;  However, NaCl and KCl that were used to depress water activity in Media 7, 9 and 12 are kosmotropic (i.e. solutions of their ions have a net kosmotropic activity; see Table 3), and this is consistent with their stabilizing effects on membranes, proteins and other cellular structures (see Brown, 1990).;  The range of water-activity values tested (0.760–0.644 aw) lies at the extreme edge of the water-activity window for all nine xerophile strains under study, and growth optima at 30°C lay between 0.95 and 0.85, as shown for one X. bisporus strain in Fig. 2J.;  Remarkably there was no correlation between rates of radial extension for these nine fungi (the most xerophilic microbes thus far identified) on glycerol-containing media at ≤ 0.72 aw, and the water activity of their culture media (Fig. 2A–I).;  Generally, on glycerol-supplemented media at ≤ 0.85 aw, the growth rates of all strains decreased in proportion to medium water activity (e.g. see Fig. 2J).;  On the glycerol-supplemented medium at 0.644 aw and the fructose-supplemented medium at 0.760 aw (despite the relatively high water activity of the latter; see Table 3) there was no hyphal growth of any xerophile strain (therefore data are not shown for Media 13 or 14 in Fig. 2).;  Paradoxically, for Medium 1 (at 0.714 aw) eight out of the nine fungal strains either failed to grow (Fig. 2A–D) or grew 65–90% more slowly than predicted (see Fig. 2E–G and I), whereas at lower water-activities (0.670–0.647) growth rates were up to 580% greater than predicted (i.e. the mixed-solute Media 6–9 and 12; see Fig. 2A–I).; Chaotropic-activity and water-activity values for solutes and solute combinations used to supplement growth media.​media.aa; Growth rates at 30°C (A–I) for the nine selected xerophiles (see also Fig. 1C–K) on highly chaotropic (solid-orange columns) or neutral media (black columns) over a range of water-activity values (0.714–0.647; see also Table 3): Medium (1) glycerol (6.84 M), Medium (2) glycerol (7.06 M), Medium (3) glycerol (5.43 M), sucrose (0.73 M) plus NaNO3 (0.24 M), Medium (4) glycerol (7.48 M, and concentrations of malt extract, yeast extract and K2HPO4 that were 10-fold more dilute than those of the control medium), Medium (5) glycerol (7.48 M), Medium (6) glycerol (5.97 M), sucrose (0.73 M), Medium (7) glycerol (3.91 M), sucrose (0.73 M), NaCl (1.20 M) plus KCl (0.13 M), Medium (8) glucose (1.11 M), glycerol (4.34 M) plus fructose (1.11 M), Medium (9) glycerol (4.67 M), sucrose (0.73 M), NaCl (1.20 M) plus KCl (0.13 M), Medium (10) glycerol (7.60 M, pH 4), Medium (11) glycerol (7.60 M), and Medium (12) glycerol (6.19 M), NaCl (1.20 M) plus KCl (0.13 M).;  Theoretical growth-rate values that were predicted based on the assumption that growth rates are proportional to medium water activity are shown for highly chaotropic media as shaded yellow columns and for neutral media as shaded grey columns.;  J. Growth curve of X. bisporus FRR 0025 over a full range of water activity values, showing the position of G (inset, lower right) in the context of the entire biotic window of this strain on glycerol-supplemented media at 30°C (see also Fig. 1I).; The lowest water activity previously reported for sustained growth of fungi was 0.656: for X. bisporus after a 90 day incubation period (Pitt and Christian, 1968).;  By comparison several fungal strains grew in the current study at 0.656 aw, and hyphal growth was observed at this water activity for one strain after only 11 days (Fig. 2F; Table 4).;  Remarkably we observed growth at water-activity values as low as 0.647, and did so in as little as 5–8 weeks, on mixed-solute media (see Fig. 2A–I; Table 4).; Fungal strains capable of hyphal growth ≤ 0.71 water activity.a; For a given fungal species, the lower water-activity limit for the germination of propagules is typically lower than that for hyphal growth (Pitt, 1975).;  However, numerous studies of spore germination of xerophiles at low water-activities (see Table S1) have found that growth ceases upon germ-tube production (Pitt and Christian, 1968).;  Whereas a number reviews cite germ-tube formation by X. bisporus spores at 0.605 aw as evidence of cellular function at ultra-low water activity (Pitt, 1975; Grant, 2004; see also Table S1), further hyphal growth and mycelium development were not recorded (Pitt and Christian, 1968).;  In the current study hyphal growth of A. penicillioides and E. amstelodami occurred at considerably lower water-activity values (0.647 and 0.656 aw on mixed-solute media; see Fig. 2E and F; Table 4) than those previously reported for germination (i.e. 0.680 and 0.703 respectively; see Table S1).;  For each xerophile strain at water-activity values below their growth optimum, growth rates were proportionally reduced (for an example, see Fig. 2J).;  However, at extremely low water activity (≤ 0.72 aw), growth rates were no longer proportional to water activity so we concluded that other stress parameters limited cellular activity.;  Furthermore, we asked the scientific questions whether the chaotropicity of glycerol-supplemented media (6.84–7.65 M glycerol) limited hyphal growth at low water activity, and whether this inhibition was reversed by the kosmotropic activity of other substances present in the mixed-solute media (3.91–6.19 M glycerol).;  By contrast, remarkably high growth-rate values were obtained on the other media that were neutral or mildly chaotropic, and these were several hundred per cent higher than those predicted from water-activity values (see Fig. 2A–I, black columns).;  There was a strong inverse correlation between chaotropic activity and fungal growth (see Figs 2A–I and ​and3A):3A): three strains that were able to grow down to 0.647 aw did not grow on any glycerol-supplemented media even at the relatively less-stressful water activity of 0.714 (Fig. 2A–C).;  However, the metabolic activity and growth rate of the latter can be orders of magnitude lower (see Fig. 2J) than that of the optimally growing cell illustrated in Fig. 3B, because it is subjected to the inhibitory effects of solutes such as lowered intra/extracellular water activity and/or solute-crowding effects, and furthermore the opposing chaotropic/kosmotropic solute activities may not be evenly balanced.; In summary, the data presented here (Figs 1, ​,22 and ​and3A;3A; Table 3) support the hypothesis that the chaotropic activity of glycerol, not the stress parameter water activity, limits cell metabolism for these xerophilic fungi at ≤ 0.72 aw.; There are several classes of solute-tolerant microbe: salt-tolerant halophiles, sugar-tolerant osmophiles, and xerophiles that tolerate low water activity (whereas conceptually distinct these ecophysiological groupings may not be mutually exclusive; see Brown, 1990).; We already have an understanding of environmentally relevant solute stresses [osmotic stress (Dutrochet, 1826), matric stress (Griffin, 1977) and chaotrope-induced water stress (Hallsworth et al., 2003a)]; how chaotropic agents determine the limits of macromolecule function (see Hallsworth et al., 2003a; 2007; Duda et al., 2004); indications of the cellular components that fail under extreme forms of stress (see current study; Hocking, 1993; Ferrer et al., 2003); and other factors that determine the limits of microbial function in hostile environments (see Fig. 4; Pitt, 1975; Golyshina et al., 2006; Hallsworth et al., 2007; Marris, 2008).;  Microbes in other natural habitats, as well as substrates used in industrial processes, may also be subjected to low water-activity conditions and/or high concentrations of chaotropic stressors such as formamide, ethanol, urea, ethylene glycol, butanol, NH4NO3, glycerol, phenol, MgCl2, CaCl2 and sodium benzoate (Brown, 1990; Hallsworth, 1998; 2003a; 2007; Bardavid et al., 2008).;  For both low water-activity and highly chaotropic substrates, analysis of the ways in which these (and other) stress parameters interact to limit biological activity can shed light on how to optimize or eliminate microbial activity, as required.;  Chaotropes and high temperatures disorder cellular structures, whereas kosmotropes and low temperatures have a stabilizing/ordering effect (Hamaguchi and Geiduschek, 1962; Collins, 1997; Hallsworth et al., 2003a) and we utilized the counteracting solute activities of glycerol and kosmotropic substances in order to extend the biotic window for xerophile growth at low water activity (Fig. 2A–I; Table 4).;  It may be that microbial cells in laboratory culture could, and that cells in nature do, function below the water-activity limit of 0.647 established in the present study (Fig. 2), and that we have not yet understood how to manipulate solute activities sufficiently well to maintain macromolecular function under high-solute conditions.; Throughout this study, all media were sterilized in Schott bottles in a water bath (100°C, 60 min), cooled to within 7.5°C of the medium gel-point, and then poured into 9 cm vented Petri plates; inoculations were carried out using 4 mm diameter plug from the periphery of actively growing cultures growing on MYPiA media supplemented with 5.43 M glycerol; and plates containing identical media were sealed in polyethylene bags to maintain a constant water activity (see Hallsworth et al., 2003b).; The nine most xerophilic strains were inoculated onto MYPiA media supplemented with four different concentrations of glycerol (5.43, 6.19, 6.84 and 7.44 M) with water activity values ranging from 0.81 and 0.65 (see Fig. 1C–K) and incubated at 15, 22.5, 30 and 37.5°C.;  Quantification of water activity is described below.; The nine xerophilic strains were inoculated onto 14 ultra-low water-activity media (0.714–0.644 aw), consisting of MYPiA media supplemented with combinations of glycerol, fructose, or glycerol plus kosmotropic solutes (see Fig. 2, Table 3, Fig.;  For water-activity and chaotropic-activity values of Media 1–14 see Table 3; the methodologies used to obtain these values are described below.; The water-activity values of media were measured at 30°C or, if different, at the temperature of incubation using a Novasina IC-II water-activity machine fitted with an alcohol-resistant humidity sensor and eVALC alcohol filter (Novasina, Pfäffikon, Switzerland), as described previously (Hallsworth and Nomura, 1999).;  This equipment was calibrated using saturated salt solutions of known water activity (Winston and Bates, 1960).;  Agar was melted in distilled water, cooled to 55°C, and added to a solution of the solute or solute-mixture to be tested, also at 55°C, to give a final concentration of agar of 1.5% w/v and concentration(s) of solute(s) as used for the growth study.;

X-ray diffraction analyses confirmed magadiite and clay minerals.;  The thickest magadiite unit at the base of the Lake Kitagata core is crumbly, overlies a palaeosol, and probably formed by capillary evaporation when the crater lake had almost desiccated81.; The ichnologic evidence provides clues to the magadiite origin at Lake Magadi.;  Whether magadiite precipitated by evaporation of a shallow, silica-rich sodium carbonate brine or in a deeper chemically stratified alkaline lake, the lake-floor environment during colonization – benthic or temporarily subaerial – would initially have been hostile to most organisms except bacteria and archaea.;  The contact between the trace-bearing magadiite bed and the overlying lacustrine silt and mud is thus regarded as the primary colonization surface, although some burrows penetrated the magadiite from up to ~8 cm above the contact.;  Accordingly, environmental conditions during colonization were either those associated with the initial silt or mud deposition upon the underlying magadiite substrate, or from this colonization surface during a short depositional hiatus.; The exposed sediments with distinct magadiite beds, including the one containing burrows, show repeating facies successions (‘cycles’) on a cm–dm scale that give clues to the pattern of sedimentation when the ichnofossils were formed (Fig. 4).;  We interpret each cycle to begin with lacustrine silt and mud and terminate with bedded magadiite of variable purity and thickness.;  Each magadiite bed is overlain by dark to greenish brown zeolitic silt, fine sand or mud (Facies a), some of which shows indistinct lamination.;  The contact, interpreted as a small-scale flooding surface, is usually sharp, but locally irregular because of minor compaction of muds into the underlying soft magadiite, local W-E slippage from the Magadi horst, or local erosion.;  These silt, fine sand and mud layers, in turn, are commonly succeeded by a few cm of interlaminated mud and magadiite (Facies b), which is commonly undulating or wavy in sectional view (Fig. 2c).;  These laminated units are then capped either by white or grey magadiite (Facies c) or magadiite containing thin brown mud laminae (Facies cm), typically with sharp upper and lower contacts (Fig. 4).;  The thickest magadiite beds have fewest impurities.;  Some are streaky in outcrop with eastward-dipping magadiite layers thinning westwards from the horst (Fig. 2b).; The critical question in interpreting these cycles is whether the magadiite bed(s) records precipitation in a shallow lake where magadiite formed by (1) evaporative concentration of a silica-rich sodic brine in shallow oxygenated water, or in (2) a deeper stratified lake with precipitation at a chemocline (Fig. 5).;  That in turn has implications for understanding the origin of bedded magadiite.; Models for the origin of bedded magadiite and its trace fossils. (a) A1 to A4 show the shallow-water model, which is best supported by our evidence.;  The brine attains saturation with respect to magadiite which precipitates seasonally, alternating with siliciclastic mud in shallow (<1–5 m?) water to form mm-scale laminites.;  With continued evaporation the shallowing brine becomes supersaturated with respect to magadiite, which precipitates and settles rapidly as soft gelatinous material that extends laterally for hundreds of metres and forms thinly bedded magadiite on the lake floor.;  In lake marginal settings and periods when lake level is unusually low, some shallow magadiite might become subaerially exposed.;  Organisms adapted to fresher waters burrow into underlying siliciclastic sediments and magadiite.;  Some open burrows become filled by fine sediments or remain open for minerals precipitated during later evaporation. (b) B1 to B4 show the perennial lake model in which magadiite precipitates at the interface of a stratified lake, when shallower dilute lake waters move across a denser sodic brine.;  Initially the magadiite may alternate with mud, forming laminites.;  The magadiite beds, which represent the most saline part of the cycle with high Na+ and aqueous SiO2, are periodically flooded by runoff that introduces detrital fine sand, silt and clay that are deposited upon a magadiite substrate.;  Mud-silt sedimentation continued from seasonal runoff but as the water shallowed and increased in salinity, it became sufficiently saline for magadiite precipitation, which for a period alternated with thin mud laminae.;  Some alternations are regular (Fig. 2d), implying that they could have been seasonal with magadiite precipitating in the drier periods and mud settling gravitationally during the rainy seasons.;  A thin dark microbial (?) lamina is also present below some magadiite beds (Fig. 2e).; The magadiite beds that cap the cycles represent the most saline (Na- and silica-rich) fluids.;  The thinner and more irregular magadiite layers could have been disrupted by intermittent subaerial exposure or intrasediment growth at a very shallow water table, but the overlying siliciclastic mud and silt shows no clear evidence of exposure.;  Were the thicker magadiite beds subaerially exposed? Where subaerially exposed today by erosion, soft plastic magadiite rapidly becomes encrusted with efflorescent trona, and soon forms a thin (1–3 mm) hard grey crust.;  This was not observed at the study site because the bedded magadiite was buried until excavated but has been observed elsewhere at several locations in the southern Magadi basin.;  Contemporary development of a hard silica crust, resulting from dehydration during exposure, would have prevented, or at least inhibited, the tracemakers from burrowing in still soft, plastic magadiite.;  The sharp, locally irregular upper contact also implies that the magadiite remained submerged during the next flooding event that introduced siliciclastic mud.; The alternative explanation would be for magadiite precipitation in a stratified lake16,19,20.;  After precipitation of magadiite in a shallow silica-rich alkaline brine, inflow of freshwater bearing fine clastic sediment might lead to temporary stratification, with magadiite precipitating in the water column at the fluid interface, where the pH was lowered along the contact of the upper and lower fluids.;  Evaporation would then lead to precipitation of thicker magadiite beds in the offshore brine until aqueous Si and Na+ declined in the surface waters.; After deposition of the magadiite beds capping the exposed lacustrine sediments (Fig. 4), the lake expanded with deposition of black and dark brown, locally organic-rich mud preserving fossil fish.;  Magadiite in black anoxic muds has also been recorded at Lake Bogoria71,72,83,89, showing that the stratified-lake model for bedded magadiite genesis is feasible but modern examples of bedded magadiite are unconfirmed.;  Most of those cherts, however, lack the characteristic reticulate crack-patterns commonly associated with diagenesis of a magadiite precursor19,90.;  Those patterns alone, however, are not necessarily diagnostic of former magadiite.;  The Green Beds chert precursor(s) might have been a siliceous gel (which form today at Nasikie Engida91, Fig. 1b), opaline silica, a carbonate mineral21, magadiite, or an as-yet-unidentified phase.;  During early diagenesis, magadiite undergoes physical and chemical changes including loss of water and Na, and early recrystallization.;  Soft magadiite transforms progressively to microcrystalline quartz.;  Using stable isotopes of oxygen at Olduvai (Tanzania), it has been shown that magadiite could ‘spontaneously’ recrystallize to quartz in saturated sodic brines20,92.; The timing of these diagenetic fluid-mineral reactions remains unclear but can be rapid (<10 ka and probably much less) because some magadiite in the High Magadi Beds has altered to kenyaite, moganite and chalcedonic microcrystalline quartz18,19,33,93.;  Early and rapid diagenesis also has implications for the interpretation of traces that were originally produced in semi-soft magadiite: first, their dimensions might change, reflecting shrinkage or expansion52 but early lithification could also reduce compaction.; Based on the evidence and discussion above, we infer that the fine sediments overlying the magadiite described in this study, although later altered to zeolites during early diagenesis33,37, record a period of more dilute lake water after the main phase of magadiite formation.;  During that time of generally fresher conditions, the trace makers inhabited the shallow lake floor, that for short times might have been subaerially exposed, and burrowed into the soft magadiite substrate.;  Continuing freshening is implied by the fossil fish upwards in the succession, notably in a dark, parallel-laminated layer approximately 10 cm above the top of the bioturbated magadiite bed.;  That would imply that the trace makers burrowed into an older magadiite bed rather than being contemporary with its precipitation, or they formed the burrows soon afterwards.; Lake water depth during magadiite sedimentation is unclear.;  That lake would have been saline and alkaline during magadiite sedimentation and perhaps only a few metres deep at its maximum depth by analogy with other examples64 (e.g., Lake Bogoria89).; The laminated and muddy facies that overlie the magadiite beds record a change to deeper water above a more extensive flooding surface and by implication, more dilute and oxic conditions, at least in the waters that extended downwards to the lake floor during periods of burrowing.;  Interlaminated magadiite and muds, which overlie the burrowed magadiite bed, might indicate seasonal or irregular stratification of the water column with magadiite particles settling by gravity.;  In this example, colonization in magadiite might have resulted from freshening and oxygenation of a shallow lake bottom and (or) brief exposure of the siliceous substrate.;  The bioturbation is decoupled from magadiite formation in terms of physical and chemical conditions.; Burrows, probably produced by beetles, have been recorded in magadiite from the High Magadi Beds (~25–9 ka) in hypersaline, alkaline Lake Magadi in the southern Kenya Rift.;  Based on sedimentological and fine-scale stratigraphic evidence, we conclude that the burrows were formed when the lake floor became temporarily fresher and oxygenated, after a period when magadiite precipitated in shallow saline waters, probably by evapoconcentration.;  R.W.R. modelled the origin of the bedded magadiite."

(2016) and Ausec et al.

"water","D014867",17215355,1783388,"Intracellular water dynamics in Haloarcula marismortui, an extremely halophilic organism originally isolated from the Dead Sea, was studied by neutron scattering.;  The water in centrifuged cell pellets was examined by means of two spectrometers, IN6 and IN16, sensitive to motions with time scales of 10 ps and 1 ns, respectively.;  This value is close to that found previously for other cells and close to that for bulk water, as well as that of the water in the 3.5 M NaCl solution bathing the cells.;  A very slow water component was discovered from the IN16 data.;  At 285 K the water-protons of this component displays a residence time of 411 ps (compared with a few ps in bulk water).;  At 300 K, the residence time dropped to 243 ps and was associated with a translational diffusion of 9.3 × 10−8 cm2 s−1, or 250 times lower than that of bulk water.;  This slow water accounts for ≈76% of cell water in H. marismortui.;  No such water was found in Escherichia coli measured on BSS, a neutron spectrometer with properties similar to those of IN16.;  It is hypothesized that the slow mobility of a large part of H. marismortui cell water indicates a specific water structure responsible for the large amounts of K+ bound within these extremophile cells.; The study of the specific properties of water in biological systems continues to yield fascinating surprises.;  If the same principle were to be responsible for K+ binding in H. marismortui, 24–32 moles oxygen per liter of cell water would be required, enormous amounts of oxygen atoms that cannot be supplied exclusively by the organic components of the cell.;  It is therefore suggested that the oxygen atoms required might be furnished by the ordering of water molecules forming a tertiary system of water, KCl, and cell proteins.; Evidence in favor of more than a single phase of water in cell pellets of H. marismortui came initially from H-NMR measurements (3).;  The visible intensity of water in such pellets accounted for all of the total water present (101 ± 7%).;  When the pellets were slowly cooled to below −19°C (the temperature at which the culture medium froze), 40% of the water signal remained visible.;  From analysis of the dynamic properties of the intracellular water, it was concluded that 55% of the cell water had a translational diffusion coefficient of 10−8 cm2 s−1, a figure three orders of magnitude lower than that of pure bulk water, protein hydration water, or water in molar solutions of NaCl or KCl (Table 1).;  The measurements were consistent with differential scanning calorimetric studies (4) in which the enthalpy of evaporation of water in pelleted cells was measured.;  The enthalpy of evaporation determines the heat needed to convert liquid water to the gaseous phase, and is, therefore, a measure of the strength of interaction between water molecules in the liquid phase.;  Two populations of water molecules were found; the first (52% of total water) had an enthalpy similar to that of 3.5 M NaCl, whereas the enthalpy of the other population was 13 KJ/mole higher (4).;  This is roughly equivalent to the enthalpy of one hydrogen bond and suggests that, in roughly half the cell water of H. marimortui, the water molecules are more tightly bound to each other, and therefore less mobile, than in 3.5 M NaCl.; Translational and rotational diffusion of water in the pure state, in the cell pellet, and in concentrated solutions of NaCl and KCl;  This second dispersion may probably be identified with water because it had a dielectric decrement of 80, characteristic of this substance, even though τ is high compared with that of bulk water (τwater measured by dielectric spectroscopy = 7 ps at 298 K; ref. 6).;  The volume fraction represented by the second dispersion has recently been calculated to represent 58.5% of total cell water (Y.; Thus, observations obtained by three different physical methods led us to conclude that cells of H. marismortui contain water with two different types (7).;  The first consists of water in the physical state characteristic of 3.5M NaCl, whereas the second involves water with a low rate of mobility.;  Therefore, we planned more direct measurements of water diffusion in intact H. marismortui cells by measuring neutron scattering in deuterium-labeled cells.; Neutron scattering is a powerful technique for the study of water and protein dynamics (8, 9).;  The dynamics of bulk water and confined water have been studied successfully at room temperature (10, 11), in supercooled water (10, 12), water in hydrogels (13), in porous systems (11), aqueous solutions (14), and water in membrane stacks (15, 16).;  Biological molecules impose restrictions on water structure and movement: the dynamics of water associated with amino acids (17) and proteins (18, 19) has been measured by neutron scattering on deuterium-labeled samples and shown to be slower by about one order of magnitude as compared with bulk water.;  The mass density of hydration shell water around proteins was measured by small angle x-ray and neutron scattering to be significantly higher than 1 (20).;  This component was attributed to the translational motions of water. (C) Half-width at half-maximum of the broad Lorentzian Γ as a function of Q2 at T = 285 K.;  This component was attributed to the rotational motions of water.; This component was attributed to translational motions of water.;  Brockhouse (23) observed that, in the case of normal water, the angular distribution of the quasielastic scattering is well governed by a factor of the type exp(−2W) and has also estimated the numerical value of 2W.; Moreover, if the assumption that τ0 ≫ τ1 holds, then we can also expect that the diffusion mechanism will not be primarily through jumps corresponding to the mean distance between water molecules; this is verified because the root mean square diffusion distance is given by L=6τ0DT=2Å, which is smaller than the mean distance between water molecules (nearly 3 Å) (21).; Calculated values for DT for water in 3.5 M NaCl at 285 K corresponds to 1.26 × 10−5 cm2/s (Table 1).;  Therefore, we conclude that the sharp Lorentzian corresponds to “normal” water slightly slowed down with respect to bulk because of the presence of ions, chiefly NaCl.; This component was attributed to rotational motions of water.;  The rotational relaxation of water has been described, using the Sears model (24), corresponding to hindered rotational diffusion of protons on the surface of a sphere of radius ρ. In the Q range of the measurements (Q ≈ 1 Å−1), the first order dominates the Sears approximation (24), and the dynamics structure factor is approximated as (11, 25)
;  The rotational correlation time τR = 1/(2DR) in H. marismortui is 1.83 ps, which is reasonably consistent with values for bulk water measured by neutron scattering and NMR (Table 1) (27).;  Protein hydration water rotational relaxation times have been measured to be higher by a retardation factor between 5 and 10 (28, 29).;  This finding suggests that it was the bulk water, and not the macromolecule hydration water, that was measured in the IN6 neutron scattering experiments on H. marismortui.;  The incoherent scattering cross-section of water in the sample accounts for 99% of the total for the D cells H2O sample and for 70% of the total in the H cells H2O sample (see Materials and Methods).;  The Lorentzian components of the two samples are identical, indicating that, in this time scale, the quasielastic signal is due to water and contains negligible contributions from cell components.;  This feature has been seen also in the translational line-widths Γ of water in other systems (11, 19). Γ is constant at ≈1.6 μeV, a value that corresponds to a residence time of 1/Γ = 411 ps.;  A similar result has been seen in the Γs of hydration water in protein (31); it is also consistent with the restricted jump diffusion model of Hall and Ross (32).;  These values indicate severely reduced water mobility with respect to bulk cell water.;  This made it possible to make a quantitative comparison of the amounts of water detected by the two instruments.;  At the same lowest value of Q accessible on both instruments, the proportion of “slow” to total water was then calculated from the ratio of the IN16 to IN6 elastic intensities.;  The slow water was thus found to represent 55% of the total cell pellet water.;  Because our former experiments had shown that the bacterial cells contained some normal water, we infer that in the quasielastic scattering of the bacterial pellets examined on IN6, both extracellular 3.5 M NaCl and the faster intracellular water is measured.;  A correction has therefore to be made for the extracellular water content of the bacterial pellets.;  This is estimated to be 28% of total pellet water under the conditions of centrifugation used (1).;  The proportions of slow and normal intracellular water detected by neutron scattering in H. marismortui could then be calculated and were found to be 76% and 24%, respectively, of cell water.;  The slow water content found by this method is somewhat higher than that detected by former methods.;  A flat background was applied, which could be seen as an extremely broad Lorentzian due to normal cell water.;  Despite the low statistical accuracy of the results, it is clear that neither the Q value nor the isotopic nature of the water had any effect on the width of the signal.;  These observations demonstrate the absence of a slow water component in E. coli.;  The DT value is slightly lower than that of pure water at 285 K, close to the 278 K value. (Table 1).;  The τ0 value corresponds to that for pure water at 263 K (Table 1).;  This is consistent with the fact that the water is slightly slowed down with respect to bulk because of the presence of high concentration of ions.;  This is consistent with the fact that, in the time window of the spectrometer, the data are sensitive to the principal extracellular component (3.5 M NaCl) and to intracellular water with DT values similar to the ones found in other cells studied.;  In the few cells in which the diffusion of cell water has been measured by neutron scattering, its value has been found to be reduced by at most one order of magnitude from that of bulk water, with DT in the range from 0.1 to 0.42 of the bulk water value (33–35).;  The IN16 and BSS spectrometers cannot detect bulk water, nor indeed water retarded by dissolved salts or polymers even at high concentrations, because the rates of diffusion of these substances are outside the range of the instrument.;  Thus, the water detected by IN16 must be intracellular, providing strong evidence for the presence of water with a very low rate of mobility within H. marismortui cells.;  At 300 K, this water had a DT of 9.34 × 10−8 cm2 s−1 or ≈250 times lower than that of bulk water at the same temperature (Table 1).;  The residence time, τ0, of ≈240 ps is ≈220 times higher than for bulk water (Table 1).; A possible reason for a lowering of cell water mobility is that this water functions as water of hydration near protein surfaces.;  The dynamics of hydration water near proteins has been studied by neutron scattering and by NMR.;  Long-range diffusion coefficients of water close to protein surfaces were found to be reduced 5–6 times as compared with the bulk solvent (36).;  Measurements of water mobility at the surface of a protein, C-phycocyanin (19) yielded a DT of 1.2. 10−5 cm2 s−1 at 298 K, in comparison with DT = 2.3 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 in bulk water at the same temperature, i.e., there is a relatively small difference between the two.;  This observation is consistent with NMR measurements of water mobility at the surface of bovine pancreatic trypsin inibitor, in which the translational retardation factor at 277 K is two (28).;  Each enzyme molecule is surrounded by a solvation shell composed of 0.2–0.4 g of water and 0.1–0.2 g of NaCl or KCl per gram of protein (38).;  In contrast, the solvation shell of homologous mesophilic proteins contains bound water but no ions, and it was concluded that salt binding appears to be a characteristic specific of molecular adaptation to halophilic conditions (38), although it is relatively weak and unspecific.;  Water and ions in close association with the enzyme molecule have been found in these studies, although the amounts of water and ions detected were far less than in the solution studies, because most of the water molecules in the solvation shell are in a disordered state and therefore invisible in high-resolution electron density maps.; There are two remarkable similarities between the solvent interactions that have been found in purified halophilic proteins and those known to occur in whole cells of H. marismortui: both purified halophilic proteins and whole cells of H. marismortui bind water and salt, and both require high salt concentrations in the bathing medium for viability (halophilic proteins unfold below 2 M KCl or NaCl).;  To conclude, the work done so far on isolated proteins explains neither the high selectivity between Na+ and K+ found in these cells (1), nor the low water mobility found in the present study.;  This latter finding confirms the indications for the existence of structured water that were deduced from the NMR, dielectric, and calorimetric measurements described in the Introduction.;  The arrangement of the water–oxygen atoms in the central cavity of the K+ channel may serve as model to explain how water in the vicinity of protein can bind K+ specifically with a very high affinity in H. marismortui.; In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the water of H. marismortui cells is of exceptionally low mobility, as compared with other cells studied up to now.;  Structured water around K+ ions has been seen by MacKinnon in the central cavity of K+ channels (48).;  Another portion was completely dried and was found to have contained 1.4 g of water per gram of dry cell material for all samples.; There was very good agreement for the ratio of water to dry cell material (i.e., 1.4 g of water per g of dry cell material), whether measured by NMR, calorimetry, or neutron scattering.;  If all of the sample material scatters in the same time window, we expect 99% of the signal to be from water in D cell H2O samples and 70% of the signal to be from water in the H cell H2O samples."

"arsenate","C025657",19218420,2663212,"More than a decade has passed since the initial reports that documented the ability of two closely related freshwater members of the Epsilonproteobacteria, Sulfurospirillum arsenophilus and Sulfurospirillum barnesii, to grow using arsenate as a respiratory electron acceptor (1, 27, 37, 48).;  Bacteria that respire arsenate can be readily cultured from pristine ecosystems (22), as well as from As-contaminated environments (1), suggesting that most species are opportunists.;  Indeed, until recently there were no reports of any true “extremophiles” from the domain Bacteria having the ability to respire arsenate at very high temperatures (≥90°C) or salinities (≥300 g/liter) or under highly alkaline (pH ≥ 11) or acidic conditions (pH ≤ 2).;  With regard to the Archaea, there is but one report of arsenate respiration within the entire domain.;  Two members of the order Thermoproteales, namely, Pyrobaculum arsenaticum and Pyrobaculum aerophilum, exhibited arsenate-dependent anaerobic growth at 95°C (16).;  They remain the only documented examples of arsenate-respiring extremophiles.; The motivation for the work reported herein came from the absence of any described species of extreme halophiles, either from the bacterial or archaeal domains, that have the capacity to conserve energy for growth by respiring arsenate.;  Because dissolved arsenic is often abundant in the waters of hot springs (e.g., see references 10, 17, and 25), as well as in closed-basin desert soda lakes that receive hydrothermal inflows (39), we opted to examine the latter as a source to enrich for extremely halophilic prokaryotes having the capacity for arsenate respiration.;  We chose Searles Lake because its brine represents an exceptionally harsh physiological challenge to life, being salt saturated (salinity, ∼346 g/liter), alkaline (pH 9.8), and high in arsenate and borate content (∼3.9 mM and 0.46 molal, respectively [24]).;  Our discovery that active arsenate respiration could be readily established with the sediments underlying this brine led to the isolation of strain SLAS-1 (40).;  These observations underscored the importance of strain SLAS-1 as representative of a portion of the flora within this ecosystem that carries out arsenate respiration.; Herein we describe strain SLAS-1 and propose the name Halarsenatibacter silvermanii strain SLAS-1T as the first reported example of an arsenate-respiring extreme halophile, taxonomically classified within the order Halanaerobacteriales of the domain Bacteria.;  We also describe a stable, mixed enrichment culture composed of an extremely halophilic sulfate reducer, an archaeon not previously noted for any ability to respire arsenate, as well as a close relative of strain SLAS-1T.;  Electron donors tested for growth in this report (with 7 mM arsenate as the electron acceptor) include (10 mM, unless indicated otherwise) lactate, glutamate, formate, galactose, serine, aspartate, propionate, succinate, citrate, malate, glycine, glucose, acetate plus H2 gas phase, acetate, fructose, pyruvate, glycerol, sulfide (2 mM), methanol (7 mM), ethanol (7 mM), and butyrate (7 mM).; The predicted amino acid translation of the SLAS-1T ArrA was compared to ArrAs of other arsenate-respiring bacteria or to ArrA-like sequences identified in the genomes of recently sequenced microorganisms.; A stable enrichment culture of microbes was established using a lactate-arsenate medium (see above) but supplemented (after autoclaving) with an antibiotic mix to favor the development of anaerobic archaea.;  We also used PCR to detect the presence of the arsenate respiratory reductase gene, arrA, within the microbial community of the antibiotic enrichment cultures.;  Fermentative growth in the absence of arsenate was not observed with either glucose or lactate.;  Growth was observed with arsenate, Fe(III), or elemental sulfur as respiratory electron acceptors, but strain SLAS-1T was unable to use nitrate, sulfate, thiosulfate, fumarate, selenate, or Mn(IV) as oxidants.;  Analysis of this DNA sequence revealed three open reading frames with high degrees of similarity to arsenate respiratory reductases: arrA; an iron sulfur cluster-containing subunit, arrB; and a putative molybdenum cofactor chaperone, arrD (Fig. ​(Fig.2A2A).; Genomic map (A) and phylogenetic analysis (B) of the arsenate respiratory reductase of SLAS-1T. (A) The arr gene cluster contains at least three genes arranged as arrABD, with likely additional arr genes downstream of arrD. (B) The phylogenetic analysis was performed by using previously established computation methods and representative members of the arsenate respiratory reductase clade of the dimethyl sulfoxide reductase family of molybdenum-containing enzymes (32).;  An asterisk indicates that the organism is known to respire arsenate.;  The analysis of the predicted proteins encoded by arrAB provides bioinformatic evidence that these genes may encode an arsenate respiratory reductase.;  It is not known what functional role ArrD has in dissimilatory arsenate reduction.; In the presence of arsenate, the initial oxidation of lactate to acetate coincided with logarithmic growth and reduction of As(V) to As(III) (Fig. ​(Fig.3A).3A).;  Sulfate reduction was confirmed by the reduction of [35S]sulfate in cultures as follows ([35S]sulfide counts are given as percentage of [35S]sulfate initially added ± 1 standard deviation; n = 3): lactate plus sulfate (4.9 ± 1.6), lactate plus sulfate plus arsenate (2.7 ± 0.8), heat-killed lactate plus sulfate control (0.08 ± 0.02).; Time course of metabolic kinetics and growth of the antibiotic enrichment culture under the following incubation conditions: lactate as the electron donor and sulfate plus arsenate as the available electron acceptors (A), lactate and sulfate only (B), sulfide as the electron donor with arsenate plus sulfate (C), and without any added electron donor but with arsenate plus sulfate (D).; The functional gene for respiratory arsenate reductase (arrA) was also detected in the antibiotic enrichment culture by using the Halobacterium archaeal codon-biased arrA primer set (HAArrA primer set) that had previously been shown to be effective at amplifying these genes in Searles Lake sediments (23, 24).;  There are no reports demonstrating arsenate respiration in N. thermophilus.;  The only other member of this order demonstrating a respiratory metabolism is Selenihalanaerobacter shriftii, which can respire with either selenate or nitrate with concomitant oxidation of glucose or glycerol but lacks any capacity for respiration of arsenate (51).; In addition, strain SLAS-1T has a capacity for chemoautotrophic growth using sulfide as its electron donor and arsenate as its electron acceptor, a mode of lithotrophic metabolism first identified for the obligate chemoautotroph strain MLMS-1 (13), as well as other isolates from Mono Lake (15).; Gene sequences for respiratory arsenate reductase are employed as a means of determining the diversity of this functional gene in environmental samples (23, 24, 30).;  This gives impetus to more fully characterize the arsenate reductases from novel bacteria isolated from the environment, so as to better interpret those in situ diversity patterns.;  The SLAS-1Tarr gene cluster contains at least three genes (Fig. ​(Fig.2):2): arrA, encoding a molybdenum oxidoreductase with strong homology to other arsenate respiratory reductases; arrB, encoding an iron sulfur subunit; and a coding sequence for a TorD-like molybdenum cofactor chaperone, arrD.;  Moreover, the genome sequences of other haloalkaliphilic arsenate-respiring bacteria, such as Alkaliphilus oremlandii OhILAs, Bacillus selenitireducens MLS10, Bacillus arseniciselenatis, and the deltaproteobacterium species strain MLMS-1 have revealed the presence of arr operons with the core set of arrAB.;  This observation suggests that SLAS-1T likely contains arsenic resistance genes, which is commonly observed in other genomes of arsenate-respiring bacteria, e.g., Shewanella sp. strain ANA-3 (44).;  Nonetheless, respiratory arsenate reduction linked to lactate oxidation was noted in the primary enrichment (Fig. ​(Fig.3A),3A), as was chemoautotrophic arsenate reduction linked to sulfide oxidation (Fig. 3A and C), both of which are consistent with the basic metabolic capabilities of strain SLAS-1T (Table ​(Table11).; Sulfate reduction was clearly detected in the enrichment, as determined by the appearance of sulfide after all the arsenate was consumed (Fig. ​(Fig.3A),3A), by the much larger amount of sulfide formed in the absence of arsenate (Fig. ​(Fig.3B)3B) and by the observed reduction of [35S]sulfate to [35S]sulfide (see Results).;  It is also possible that these sulfate reducers have the capacity to respire arsenate, a stronger oxidant than sulfate, as has been shown with examples from both gram-positive and gram-negative sulfate reducers cultured from freshwater environments (29, 36).;  This could potentially put them in competition with strain SLAS-1T for available arsenate.;  Some additional circumstantial evidence supports the possible occurrence of halophilic arsenate-respiring archaea, including the recovery of diverse arrA amplicons from the sediments of both Mono and Searles Lakes from the use of a degenerate primer set having codons of halophilic archaea (HAArrA primer set) (23).;  Indeed, we were unable to achieve anaerobic, arsenate-dependent respiratory growth of this organism when we examined the type strain (J.;  Hence, either our detection of this archaeon in the enrichment was merely fortuitous and unrelated to the presence of arsenate or the possibility exists that a yet-to-be-described close relative of the genus Halorhabdus exists that can grow under conditions of salt saturation by respiring arsenate.;  N.L. arsenas, -atis, arsenate, N.L. masc. n. bacter rod, N.L.;  Halarsenatibacter halophilic arsenate-utilizing rod).;  Growth is by dissimilatory (respiratory) reduction of arsenate to arsenite, Fe(III) to Fe(II), and elemental sulfur to sulfide.;  Chemoautotrophic growth occurs with sulfide as the electron donor and arsenate as the electron acceptor.;  The following organic substrates served as electron donors: glucose, malate, fructose, galactose, lactate, and pyruvate with arsenate as the electron acceptor."
"salt","D012492",19218420,2663212,"Searles Lake occupies a closed basin harboring salt-saturated, alkaline brines that have exceptionally high concentrations of arsenic oxyanions.;  We also report on the substrate dynamics of an anaerobic enrichment culture obtained from Searles Lake that grows under conditions of salt saturation and whose members include a novel sulfate reducer of the order Desulfovibriales, the archaeon Halorhabdus utahensis, as well as a close homolog of strain SLAS-1T.;  We chose Searles Lake because its brine represents an exceptionally harsh physiological challenge to life, being salt saturated (salinity, ∼346 g/liter), alkaline (pH 9.8), and high in arsenate and borate content (∼3.9 mM and 0.46 molal, respectively [24]).; For negative stains, cells were harvested from culture and layered on a 200-mesh, carbon- and Formvar-coated transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grid that was then floated on a drop of distilled water to reduce the concentration of interfering salts before being negatively stained with 2% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate.;  Since high salt inhibits the polymerization of the embedding plastic, the salt concentration of the growth medium was gradually reduced from 100% to 0% in 25% steps via washing in deionized water and centrifugation.;  While no growth occurred at salinities below 200 g/liter, roughly equivalent growth rates (0.015 to 0.018 h−1) were observed at higher salinities, including at salt saturation (∼340 g/liter) (40).; The measured sulfate reduction activity and presence of 16S rRNA gene sequences closely related to those of sulfate reducers within the salt-saturated enrichment culture poses another paradox, namely, that sulfate reducers are thought to be excluded from extremely hypersaline systems as a consequence of energy conservation considerations (41).;  Although sulfate reducers have been detected in and cultured from the highly saline (∼270 g/liter) northern arm of Great Salt Lake, they were operating therein at their physiological limits with regard to salt tolerance (21).;  Indeed, we have recently isolated a sulfate reducer from this enrichment culture (strain SLSR-1) that can grow under conditions of salt saturation (J.;  Hence, either our detection of this archaeon in the enrichment was merely fortuitous and unrelated to the presence of arsenate or the possibility exists that a yet-to-be-described close relative of the genus Halorhabdus exists that can grow under conditions of salt saturation by respiring arsenate.;  Gr. n. hals, halos, salt.;  Extreme halophile that grows between 200 and 350 g/liter salinity with an optimum at salt saturation (∼350 g/liter) and no growth below 200 g/liter."

 We also describe a stable, mixed enrichment culture composed of an extremely halophilic sulfate reducer, an archaeon not previously noted for any ability to respire arsenate, as well as a close relative of strain SLAS-1T.;  Electron acceptors tested for growth (with 10 mM lactate as the electron donor) include (10 mM, unless indicated otherwise) oxygen (5% or 10% headspace volume), nitrate, nitrite, sulfate, thiosulfate, fumarate, tungstate, selenate, selenite, trimethylamine oxide, Fe(III)-nitrilotriacetic acid, elemental sulfur (∼100 mmol/liter), and manganese dioxide (10 to 20 mmol/liter).;  Sulfate reduction was assayed by injecting [35S]sulfate (∼4.0 × 109 Bq/30 ml culture).;  Growth was observed with arsenate, Fe(III), or elemental sulfur as respiratory electron acceptors, but strain SLAS-1T was unable to use nitrate, sulfate, thiosulfate, fumarate, selenate, or Mn(IV) as oxidants.;  Sulfate reduction was confirmed by the reduction of [35S]sulfate in cultures as follows ([35S]sulfide counts are given as percentage of [35S]sulfate initially added ± 1 standard deviation; n = 3): lactate plus sulfate (4.9 ± 1.6), lactate plus sulfate plus arsenate (2.7 ± 0.8), heat-killed lactate plus sulfate control (0.08 ± 0.02).;  There was a 4:1 ratio of sulfide consumed to As(V) reduced; however, growth was far slower and less extensive than that achieved in the lactate-amended conditions with either As(V) plus sulfate (Fig. ​(Fig.3A)3A) or with only sulfate (Fig. ​(Fig.3B)3B) present as electron acceptors.; Time course of metabolic kinetics and growth of the antibiotic enrichment culture under the following incubation conditions: lactate as the electron donor and sulfate plus arsenate as the available electron acceptors (A), lactate and sulfate only (B), sulfide as the electron donor with arsenate plus sulfate (C), and without any added electron donor but with arsenate plus sulfate (D).;  All incubation conditions contained abundant sulfate ions (>700 mM).;  SLAb1-2 and SLAb1-4 were affiliated with sulfate-reducing members of the Deltaproteobacteria, with the highest similarity (88% each) to Desulfonatronovibrio hydrogenovorans ({""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""X99234"",""term_id"":""2832755"",""term_text"":""X99234""}}X99234), a member of the Desulfovibrionaceae.;  SLAb-3 was also affiliated with the Desulfovibrionaceae; however, it is a deep-branching affiliate unrelated to any specific member of this family of sulfate-reducing bacteria.; Sulfate reduction was clearly detected in the enrichment, as determined by the appearance of sulfide after all the arsenate was consumed (Fig. ​(Fig.3A),3A), by the much larger amount of sulfide formed in the absence of arsenate (Fig. ​(Fig.3B)3B) and by the observed reduction of [35S]sulfate to [35S]sulfide (see Results).;  Again, the presence of sulfate reducers was confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis (Fig. ​(Fig.4),4), which indicated a population of relatives of Desulfonatronovibrio and deeply branching members of the Desulfovibrionaceae, a family of sulfate-reducing bacteria.; The measured sulfate reduction activity and presence of 16S rRNA gene sequences closely related to those of sulfate reducers within the salt-saturated enrichment culture poses another paradox, namely, that sulfate reducers are thought to be excluded from extremely hypersaline systems as a consequence of energy conservation considerations (41).;  Indeed, we were unable to detect [35S]sulfate reduction in sediments from Searles Lake, even when we took a number of steps to conjure its activity by adding electron donors and/or by lowering the sulfate content to increase the specific activity of the added [35S]sulfate radiotracer (23).;  Nonetheless, high rates of sediment sulfate reduction have been reported in extremely hypersaline soda lakes in Russia (9).;  Although sulfate reducers have been detected in and cultured from the highly saline (∼270 g/liter) northern arm of Great Salt Lake, they were operating therein at their physiological limits with regard to salt tolerance (21).;  In the case of mineral-rich Searles Lake, sulfate reduction appears to be constrained in part by its high salinity (∼345 g/liter) but also by the high levels of borate present in the brine (24).;  Nonetheless, intact anoxic sediment cores from Searles Lake contain discernible levels of free sulfide (0.1 to 0.2 mM) (23, 40), suggesting that some level of either sulfate reduction or reduction of other intermediates of the sulfur cycle (e.g., thiosulfate or elemental sulfur) occurs therein.;  Indeed, we have recently isolated a sulfate reducer from this enrichment culture (strain SLSR-1) that can grow under conditions of salt saturation (J.;  Switzer Blum, unpublished data), which suggests that in situ sulfate reduction in Searles Lake is probably constrained by a multiplicity of factors in addition to salinity.;  It is also possible that these sulfate reducers have the capacity to respire arsenate, a stronger oxidant than sulfate, as has been shown with examples from both gram-positive and gram-negative sulfate reducers cultured from freshwater environments (29, 36)."
"BP","C038809",18048917,2556953,"NaVBP is the member of the bacterial voltage-gated Na+ channel superfamily found in alkaliphilic Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4.;  The alkaliphile requires NaVBP for normal chemotaxis responses and for optimal pH homeostasis during a shift to alkaline conditions at sub-optimally low [Na+]. We hypothesized that interaction of NaVBP with one or more other proteins in vivo, specifically methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), is involved in activation of the channel under the pH conditions that exist in the extremophile and could underpin its role in chemotaxis; MCPs transduce chemotactic signals and generally localize to cell poles of rod-shaped cells.;  Here, immunofluorescence microscopy and fluorescent protein fusion studies showed that an alkaliphile protein (designated McpX) that cross-reacts with antibodies raised against Bacillus subtilis McpB co-localizes with NaVBP at the cell poles of B. pseudofirmus OF4.;  In a mutant in which NaVBP-encoding ncbA is deleted, the content of McpX was close to the wild-type level but McpX was significantly delocalized.;  A mutant of B. pseudofirmus OF4 was constructed in which cheAW expression was disrupted to assess whether this mutation impaired polar localization of McpX, as expected from studies in Escherichia coli and Salmonella, and, if so, whether NaVBP would be similarly affected.;  Polar localization of both McpX and NaVBP was decreased in the cheAW mutant.;  The results suggest interactions between McpX and NaVBP that affect their co-localization.;  Recently, roles were demonstrated for the voltage-gated sodium channel, NaVBP, from alkaliphilic Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4 in pH homeostasis, motility and chemotaxis at alkaline pH (Ito et al., 2004b).;  The current studies probe cell biological properties of NaVBP that could underpin these physiological roles.; NaVBP is a member of the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel superfamily, NaVBac whose founding member is the NaChBac channel from alkaliphilic Bacillus halodurans C-125 (Koishi et al., 2004; Ren et al., 2001).;  In our initial studies, we therefore turned to B. pseudofirmus OF4, in which the ncbA gene that encodes the NaChBac homologue NaVBP could be deleted in order to probe the physiological roles of the channel (Ito et al., 2004b).;  NaVBP has roles in motility, chemotaxis, and pH homeostasis at high pH (Ito et al., 2004b).;  We hypothesized that interaction of NaVBP with one or more other proteins in vivo, specifically either methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) or flagellar motor.; Bioenergetic studies on an ncbA mutant of B. pseudofirmus OF4, lacking NaVBP, showed that the channel plays a role in Na+ re-entry in support of pH homeostasis at pH 10.5 under low [Na+] conditions and low concentrations of solutes whose entry is coupled to Na+. The ncbA mutant also displayed a motility defect at high pH even though it possessed the motPS genes that are a required stator-force generating Na+ channel required for flagella rotation (Ito et al., 2004a; Ito et al., 2004b).; The parallel electrophysiological studies of the channel in eukaryotic cells demonstrated that NaVBP is a Na+-specific voltage-gated channel whose activation is potentiated at high pH (Ito et al., 2004b).;  A particularly attractive hypothesis was that NaVBP interacts with transmembrane chemoreceptors (also known as methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, MCPs), accounting both for triggering and channel effects in chemotaxis.;  If NaVBP interacts with polar MCPs and/or the kinase/adaptor proteins that are complexed with them in B. pseudofirmus OF4, the channels should also localize to the cell poles.;  On the other hand, if NaVBP interacts with flagellar motors, a delocalized pattern would be expected consistent with a peritrichous pattern of flagella in this alkaliphile (Fig. 1) (Fujinami et al., 2007; Sturr et al., 1994).;  We conducted an immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) analysis of B. pseudofirmus OF4 cells to confirm the polar localization of MCPs and compare it with the localization pattern of NaVBP.;  MCP localization was assessed using monoclonal antibodies against NaVBP, and polyclonal antibodies that were raised against B. subtilis McpB, a chemoreceptor for Asn, Asp, Gln, Glu, and His (Hanlon & Ordal, 1994).;  Channel localization was also probed using a plasmid expressing a NaVBP-cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) fusion protein in B. pseudofirmus OF4.;  We further examined whether disruption of the alkaliphile cheAW locus decreases localization of McpX, NaVBP or both.; The results indicate that NaVBP co-localizes at cell poles with an alkaliphile protein that is recognized by antibodies raised against B. subtilis McpB.;  Alkaliphilic B. pseudofirmus OF4 wild-type (strain 811M) (Clejan et al., 1989) and its derivative strains were grown aerobically in semi-defined malate-yeast extract (MYE) medium (pH 10) (Sturr et al., 1994) at 37°C. pH 10 medium replaced the pH 10.5 medium used in most of our studies because the SC34 strain that lacked a functional NaVBP exhibited a significant deficit in mid-logarithmic growth at the higher pH value; earlier studies of SC34 growth had examined yield at stationary phase and a defect at high pH was not observed (Ito et al., 2004b).;  In this plasmid, NaVBP-CFP is expressed under the control of the native ncbA promoter.;  NaVBP-CFP (A) and CFP (B) is expressed under the control of the ncbA promoter.;  An anti-NaVBP mouse monoclonal antibody (L30/34; IgG2b isotype) was generated against a recombinant, bacterially expressed full-length NaVBP protein.; The following antibodies and reagents were used for detection in immunoblot analyses: for McpB (B. subtilis) and McpX (B. pseudofirmus OF4), 1/2000 rabbit anti-B. subtilis McpB antibody and 1/3000 Goat anti-Rabbit HRP (Bio-Rad); and for NaVBP-CFP and CFP, 1/250 (whole cell analyses) or 1/1000 (membrane fraction analyses) rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Clontech), 1/3000 Goat anti Rabbit HRP (Bio-Rad), and Can Get SignalTM Immunoreaction Enhancer Solution (TOYOBO).;  NaVBP could not be detected in immunoblot analyses of either whole cells or membranes using the anti-NaVBP mouse monoclonal L30/34 anti-body (data not shown).; The slide was treated for 1 hr at room temperature with the primary antibody solution (1/1000 mouse anti-NaVBP monoclonal L30/34 antibody or 1/2000 rabbit anti-B. subtilis McpB polyclonal antibody in PBSTE-BSA), and covered with a cover glass in a shading moisture chamber.;  It was then treated for 1 hr at room temperature with a secondary antibody solution (1/1000 Alexa Fluor 488 rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) for the NaVBP, and Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) for the McpX in PBSTE-BSA).;  In each experiment, over 30 cells were assessed with respect to the subcellular localization of NaVBP and McpX, and the length of the cells.;  The localization of NaVBP and McpX was classified by two researchers (S.F. and M.I.) as: A:One pole; B:Two poles; C:One pole and side(s); D:Two poles and side(s); E:Side(s); or diffuse (Table 3 and ​and44).; Quantification of the co-localization of NaVBP and McpX; Quantification of the subcellular localization of NaVBP-CFP and CFP;  In each experiment, over 30 cells were classified with respect to the subcellular localization of NaVBP-CFP and CFP.; IFM of NaVBP and McpX was then conducted in B. pseudofirmus OF4 wild-type and its mutant derivatives to assess the localization of these proteins.;  Both McpX and NaVBP localize extensively to cell poles of the wild-type strain (Fig. 4).;  Quantification of the co-localization of NaVBP and McpX is shown in Table 3 (top rows of each section). “Total cells” designates the total number of the cells that were analyzed.;  Subcellular localization of NaVBP was observed in 92% of wild-type (811M) cells.;  In 82% of 811M cells, NaVBP was localized at a cell pole, and in 90% of such cells, polar co-localization of NaVBP and McpX was observed.;  McpX fluorescence in the SC34-R strain that was localized at the poles rose from 15% in SC34 to 71% in the SC34-R strain and 96% of that was co-localized with NaVBP (Fig. 4 and Table 3, third rows of each section).;

Third column of images: McpX, Immunofluorescence microscopy for McpX (Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG is red).;  Fourth column of images: Overlay images of the images in Columns 2 (NaVBP) and 3 (McpX).; The finding that mutational loss of NaVBP led to delocalization of McpX raised the possibility that the inverse chemotaxis phenotype observed in the ΔncbA strain could result entirely from secondary delocalization of MCPs rather than from a channel function of NaVBP itself.;  Evidence against this line of reasoning was the earlier observation that the NaVBP channel inhibitor nifedipine caused inverse chemotaxis behavior of wild-type B. pseudofirmus OF4 toward the chemoattractant aspartate when the inhibitor added to the chemotaxis assay buffer (at 50 μM) (Ito et al., 2004b).;  IFM experiments were conducted to test whether comparable exposure of the wild-type strain to nifedipine caused delocalization of NaVBP or McpX.;  As shown in Fig. 5, bands corresponding to the expected location for NaVBP-CFP fusion were detected in whole cell and membrane fractions of the SC34/pSC-CFP transformant (white arrows).;  Anti-NaVBP mouse monoclonal antibody was also used for this detection.;  However, the antibody was not able to detect denatured NaVBP for immunoblot analyses.;  This monoclonal antibody can probably recognize an antigen only when NaVBP maintains three-dimensional structure.; Immunoblot analyses of NaVBP-CFP and CFP in whole cells and membrane fractions of B. pseudofirmus OF4 wild-type and its mutant derivatives.;  Bands for NaVBP-CFP fusion and CFP are indicated with white arrows and a filled arrow, respectively.; The subcellular localization of NaVBP-CFP of SC34/pSC-CFP and CFP of SC34/pCFP was observed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 6).;  NaVBP-CFP was localized at cell poles in SC34/pSC-CFP (Fig. 6A), and CFP was not localized in SC34/pCFP (Fig. 6B).;  Polar localization of NaVBP-CFP was observed in 88% of SC34/pSC-CFP cells (Table 4).; Sub-cellular localization of NaVBP-CFP and CFP in the ncbA deletion strain.;  Left images: DIC, differential-interference contrast microscopy; Right images: NaVBP-CFP or CFP, fluorescence microscopy monitoring CFP.;  It was therefore impossible to disrupt this gene and examine whether the disruption caused NaVBP delocalization.;  However, it was possible to test whether the delocalization of MCPs that results from mutational loss of CheAW would lead to NaVBP localization.;  IFM studies of the subcelluar localization of McpX and NaVBP showed a decrease in the polar localization of both McpX and NaVBP in 811M-CheAW in comparison with the wild-type parent (Fig. 4A and Table 3, fourth rows of both sections).;  The polar localization of McpX decreased from 78% in wild-type to 33% in 811M-CheAW, with only 51% co-localized with NaVBP in the mutant.;  The polar localization of NaVBP decreased from 82% in wild-type to 33% 811M-CheAW, with only 50% co-localized with McpX in the mutant.; NaVBP had earlier been shown to have a role in pH homeostasis, motility and chemotaxis in B. pseudofirmus OF4 (Ito et al., 2004b).;  The role in pH homeostasis was presumed to reflect a contribution of NaVBP to entry of Na+ in support of the Na+/H+ antiport that supports pH homeostasis during alkalinization of the medium, e.g. during a pH 8.5 → 10.5 shift in the outside pH.;  The role of NaVBP observed in the pH shift experiments was especially notable in the presence of low Na+ and when the medium contained low concentrations of solutes that enter the cell together with Na+. No deficit was observed in the growth yield of the channel mutant at pH 10.5 in MYE medium with optimal Na+ and solutes that are co-transported with Na+, so no role for NaVBP in pH homeostasis under optimal conditions was indicated in the earlier studies.;  These results indicated that NaVBP does have a role in alkaline pH homeostasis even when adequate Na+ and solutes are present.;  However, the role of NaVBP in pH homeostasis cannot explain the dramatic effect of channel loss on chemotaxis.;  Rather, we hypothesize that the effect of NaVBP status on the chemotaxis behavior of B. pseudofirmus OF4 is related to the interaction between NaVBP and chemotaxis proteins.; In summary, the major findings on the localization of alkaliphile NaVBP and an MCP that emerge from this work are as follows. (i) The putative alkaliphile MCP designated McpX localized at cell poles as anticipated from similar findings in other systems (Kirby et al., 2000).;  It is possible that the experiments captured McpX that was in-transit or that was localized to a central region destined to be a new pole. (ii) NaVBP also exhibited localization to the cell poles, as shown both by IFM (Fig. 4, Table 3) and fluorescence microscopy on cells expressing CFP fused to the channel (Fig. 6, Table 4).;  The expression of the fused channel restored wild-type motility properties as assessed in soft agar plates and reversed tumbly properties as assessed qualitatively by microscopic examination (Table 5). (iii) A significant percentage of the polarly localized McpX and NaVBP exhibited co-localization (Fig. 4, Table 3).;  On the other hand, the pattern of NaVBP localization did not correlate well with the pattern of peritrichous flagellum location in wild-type B. pseudofirmus OF4.;  The wild-type strain typically has 1-2 flagella/cell and these are located at various locations around the cell body (Fujinami et al., 2007). (iv) The expression level of McpX was not markedly changed in the ncbA mutant that lacks NaVBP, but the McpX was significantly delocalized.;  This effect was reversed appreciably in a strain in which ncbA was restored to the chromosome (Fig. 4, Table 3). (v) Significant delocalization of both NaVBP and McpX was observed when cheAW genes of the wild-type were disrupted (Table 3).;  Perhaps association of NaVBP and McpX is sufficient to allow a low level of polar co-localization in B. pseudofirmus OF4.; The finding that mutational loss of NaVBP leads to delocalization of McpX raises the possibility that such delocalization is in part responsible for the altered chemotactic responses rather than loss of channel function itself being completely responsible.;  However, the functional capacity of NaVBP is also essential for normal chemotaxis.;  Nifedipine addition to chemotaxis assay buffers results in inverse chemotaxis (Ito et al., 2004b) but does not result in delocalization of NaVBP and McpX.;  This supports the possibility that NaVBP-mediated fluctuations in membrane potential could play a role in the signaling pathway for chemotaxis of B. pseudofirmus OF4, as was raised for channels not yet identified in earlier studies of chemotaxis in Spirochaeta aurantia (Goulbourne & Greenberg, 1983) and E. coli (Tisa et al., 1993; Tisa et al., 2000).;  The co-localization of NaVBP and MCPs further raises the possibility that modulation of NavBP function could occur via dynamic changes in NavBP phosphorylation as mediated by chemoreceptor activation of the CheA kinase and CheZ phosphatase system that presumably are also present at the cell poles (Baker et al., 2006).;  This could lead to changes in NavBP gating as occurs in many eukaryotic voltage-gated ion channels (Levitan, 1999).;  The cytoplasmic C-terminus of NavBP contains four aspartate residues that could serve as potential phosphoacceptors for the CheA kinase; changes in C-terminal phosphorylation of eukaryotic channels can profoundly affect channel gating (Park et al., 2006)."
"water","D014867",20657662,2904767," We hypothesize that the tails increase the chances of the protein to be located in the remaining water patches in the desiccated cell, where it is protected from the desiccation effects and can function normally.;  Interestingly, these regions are absent in homologue proteins in non-extremophile bacteria, suggesting that they might be involved in helping the key rescue-and-repair proteins in D. radiodurans, such as nudix hydrolase, adapt to the extreme absence of water.;  We show that the disordered regions in nudix hydrolase enlarge the overall surface of the enzyme, and most importantly, increase its overall affinity for water (i.e. its hydrophilicity).;  We suggest a novel hypothesis that this, indeed, may be the principal function of disordered regions in some cases: they increase the chances of the protein to be located in the remaining water patches in the desiccated cell, where it is protected from the desiccation effects and can function normally.; Being extremely charged and hydrophilic, the composition of an ID stretch of amino acids is expected to share significant similarity with the composition of the water-exposed surface of a typical globular protein.;  Moreover, due to the solvent viscosity that is approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of water, one can argue that the 2 ns trajectories actually capture events that would actually occur on the 200 ns time-scale.;  Namely, following the Kramers' relation, the rate of activated processes is inversely proportional to solvent viscosity in the high-friction limit [43]. While this relation does not hold for all values of solvent viscosity, it has been shown that for protein simulations it is valid for values down to approximately 1/1000 that of water [44], including the one used herein.; Note that the hydration free energy, as calculated and discussed here, is the free energy needed to transfer a protein from vacuum to water, and is only a first-order approximation to the actual free energy required to move a given protein from a desiccated region of a cell to a hydrated region.;  One can assume that these are the same for all proteins, provided they find themselves in similar environments both in water and in desiccated aggregates.;  In this sense, the relative ordering of HFEs that we calculated (water - vacuum) is the same as it would be in the case of the difference in HFE between water and desiccated aggregates.;  The only thing we assume here is that  has the same sign as , which is likely the case, since aggregates are expected to have a lower permittivity than water.;  This effect may be functionally important when water is scarce.;  Namely, under extreme desiccation conditions, D. radiodurans loses large amounts of water and experiences oxidative stress, causing a number of changes.;  The removal of the hydration shell from phospholipids in the membrane causes an increase in their phase transition temperature and their transition to gel phase at environmental temperatures [54]. In the cytoplasm, sugars such as trehalose can replace the shell of water molecules around proteins [55]. At environmental temperatures, this leads to the formation of a glassy matrix within cell (with mechanical properties of a plastic solid) with increased viscosity limiting in such way all processes that require diffusion and ensuring stability [56]. Proteins known to be expressed in stages of extreme desiccation are those belonging to the late embryiogenesis abundant (LEA) family of proteins [57]. Their function and mode of action are far from understood and call for further investigation.;  We hypothesize that precisely this is the function of the hydrophilic tails of D. radiodurans' nudix hydrolase – they increase the likelihood for the protein to stay in patches of residual water in the cell (i.e. in the more hydrated areas of the heterogeneous cellular matrix), while other proteins denature due to the removal of water (Figure 5).; (Left) A D. radioduranscell under physiological conditions, where all proteins are functional. (Right) The same cell in a state of desiccation: There are only patches of water left in the cell.;  Nudix hydrolase, however, having lower hydration free energy than most other proteins, is likely to be found in remaining patches of water and is hence still functional."
