"toxicity","D064420",37317247,10223213," This review provides scientific information for a broader understanding of general dyes, their toxicity, and their harmful effects.;  Further, the high cost of these treatments limits their application, leading to increased ecotoxicity in the long term [5,6]. Hence, biodegradation has been evaluated as an efficient alternative approach that has attracted research attention because it overcomes the drawbacks of traditional techniques and is economical, eco-friendly, and sustainable.; The presence of color associated with dyes increases the chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), total organic carbon (TOC), and suspended solids which reduce photosynthesis, promote toxicity of several intermediate amino acids, inhibit plant growth, and create recalcitrance and bioaccumulation [26,27,28]. Furthermore, the residuals of chemicals used during dye manufacture can evaporate and pollute the air.; Moreover, dyes ingested and accumulated in fish can become toxic intermediates for both fish and their predators including humans [29]. Traditional techniques and limited biodegradability lead to recalcitrance and bioaccumulation and may promote toxicity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity [6,30].; Different physicochemical methods have been used for dye removal from textile industry wastewater; however, they are costly, non-environmentally friendly, and cause immediate secondary toxicity."

"abiotic stresses","D000079225 ",33925342,8123667," Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins typically accumulate in response to various abiotic stresses, including dehydration, salinity, high temperature, and cold, or during the late stage of seed development.;  Late embryogenesis abundant proteins (LEAs) and abscisic acid-, stress-, and ripening-induced proteins (ASRs) are supposed to play crucial roles in the processes of drought resistance or other water-deficit stresses [1,2,3,4,5]. LEA genes have been characterized in plants ranging from algae to higher plants, as well as in invertebrates, fungi, and bacteria [6]. LEA proteins, which are intrinsically disordered proteins, often have the feature of high hydrophilicity and are identified as hydrophilins [7,8]. LEA proteins play protective roles during cell exposure to different abiotic stresses, and these roles are associated with antioxidant, metal ion binding, membrane and protein stabilization, hydration buffering, and DNA and RNA interaction properties [9,10]. Unlike LEA proteins, ASR proteins are plant specific and possess apparent features that are typically absent in Brassicaceae species [11]. Numerous reports have indicated that plant ASRs have important functions in response to water-deficit stress in many plant species, basically acting as transcription factors or chaperones [12,13]. Some previous reports also classified plant ASRs into the LEA superfamily [8,14].;  Many reports have indicated that the majority of plant LEA mRNAs are induced by various abiotic stresses, such as drought, high salinity, low temperature, oxidation, and osmotic stress [6,18,20]. Some reports have also indicated that in addition to transcriptional regulation, LEA proteins undergo translational or posttranslational modifications, reflecting the complexity of the regulation of these proteins at various levels [21,22]. Basically, LEA proteins are predicted to keep intrinsically disordered proteins in the fully hydrated state, which can then be folded in the water-deficit state and acquire α-helical structures.; The ASR proteins, by contrast, seem to be plant-specific with a small gene family [11,29]. ASRs also have a low molecular weight and exhibit heat-stable and highly hydrophilic characteristics in plants [30]. As observed for plant LEAs, many reports have found that ASRs are also functionally involved in abiotic stress responses, acting as molecular chaperons [31], osmotic adjustment proteins [32], metal-binding protein [33], and antioxidation or detoxification proteins [34,35]. In addition, some ASRs also possess unique functions as transcription factors [12,36]. Due to their highly similar biochemical properties and biological functions, some recent studies have also classified ASRs as LEA proteins in the LEA_7 group [11,37,38]. Numerous reports also indicate that plant ASR genes respond to ABA and abiotic stresses such as water deficit, salt, drought, cold, and osmotic stress [11,13].; In addition, ASRs and dehydrins have been reported to be crucial in the tolerance to different abiotic stresses, including drought, high salinity/alkaline, or extreme temperatures [11,41]. The LEA_4 subfamily has been suggested to have a close association with the evolution of desiccation tolerance in plants [20]. In this study, we paid special attention to the promoter regions of CrASRs (three members), CrDHNs (five members), and CrLEA_4s (two members).; Based on reports on the different LEA numbers involved in abiotic stresses [8,11,20,41,42,43,44,45], with reference to the RNA-Seq results and the promoter region analysis, we further identified 10 genes (including three CrASRs, five CrDHNs, and two CrLEA_4s) for expression analysis in different C. rosea tissues.; Combined with our transcriptional analyses and promoter regions’ prediction, we could conclude preliminarily that these 10 CrLEAs and CrASRs (three CrASRs, five CrDHNs, and two CrLEA_4s) are closely related with the adaptation to abiotic stresses in C. rosea, especially to high salinity, alkaline, or water deficit, etc.;  ASR genes, which encode hydrophilic proteins or transcription factors, were first identified from a tomato cDNA library and participated in response to water-stressed conditions both in stressed leaves and in ripe fruits [41]. LEA proteins constitute a large multigene family that is closely related to the response to abiotic stresses in multiple plant species and that protects cells against water deficit caused by drought and other stresses.; The accumulation of LEA proteins in cells is crucial for the response of organisms to different abiotic stresses.;  These elements are believed to be involved in plant responses to dehydration, low temperature, salt stress, and other abiotic stresses (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/, accessed on 1 March 2021)."
" dehydration","D003681 ",33925342,8123667," Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins typically accumulate in response to various abiotic stresses, including dehydration, salinity, high temperature, and cold, or during the late stage of seed development.;  It has been proved that plant ASRs are closely related with water deficit stress and drought tolerance [11,41], and the dehydrins play fundamental roles in plant response and adaptation to salinity and dehydration stresses [8,42]. LEA_4 genes, also known as group 3 [8], have been proved being strongly associated with drought tolerance in basal and angiosperm resurrection plants via ABA signaling pathway [20]. The RNA-Seq analysis showed that nine of these 10 genes displayed higher expression levels in the YX leaf sample than in the SCBG leaf sample (except for CrASR2).; LEA protein genes, which were first identified on account of their marked transcript accumulation in embryos for coping with rapid dehydration during seed maturation [15], were later found to be induced in vegetative plant tissues under environmental stress conditions.;  Most LEA proteins are termed hydrophilins mainly due to their unifying and outstanding feature of high hydrophilicity and a high content of Gly and small amino acids such as Ala and Ser [8]. Previous research indicated that some LEA proteins present a high degree of unordered structure in solution and are considered IDPs [23]. The high hydrophilicity and intrinsically disordered features of LEAs facilitate their protective functions by promoting associations with membrane surfaces or protein partners for protection, and by sequestering H2O, ROS, ions, or other small molecules for alleviating damage or toxicity [23]. Except for some LEA_2 members, most of CrLEA/CrASR proteins showed negative GRAVY scores (<0) (Table 1), indicating that these proteins have strong hydrophilicity and could offer pivotal protective roles under rapid and severe dehydration in plants.;  Numerous reports have demonstrated that overexpressing LEA genes in different organisms resulted in improved salinity and dehydration tolerance.;  These elements are believed to be involved in plant responses to dehydration, low temperature, salt stress, and other abiotic stresses (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/, accessed on 1 March 2021)."

Basically, LEA proteins are predicted to keep intrinsically disordered proteins in the fully hydrated state, which can then be folded in the water-deficit state and acquire α-helical structures.;  The ordered LEAs can act as molecular chaperones to bind enzymes, membranes, DNA/RNA, water or ions, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), therefore playing crucial roles in stabilizing proteins/membranes and maintaining cellular environmental homeostasis under abiotic stress [23]. Many studies have characterized several LEA gene families from a few sequenced genomes of plant species, particularly from plant species in specialized habitats, such as halophytes [24], xerophytes [25,26], heat- or freeze-tolerant plants [27,28], or cash crops with strong adversity resistance [24,25,26,27,28,29]. In general, the LEA families that have been identified and studied all contain dozens of members with similar structural and functional plasticity, with the typical evolutionary features and genomic diversification resulting from the adaptation of plants to water-limited environments [20]. ; The ASR proteins, by contrast, seem to be plant-specific with a small gene family [11,29]. ASRs also have a low molecular weight and exhibit heat-stable and highly hydrophilic characteristics in plants [30]. As observed for plant LEAs, many reports have found that ASRs are also functionally involved in abiotic stress responses, acting as molecular chaperons [31], osmotic adjustment proteins [32], metal-binding protein [33], and antioxidation or detoxification proteins [34,35].

Numerous reports also indicate that plant ASR genes respond to ABA and abiotic stresses such as water deficit, salt, drought, cold, and osmotic stress [11,13].;  There is no doubt that C. rosea has developed elaborate mechanisms to adapt to the high sanity/alkaline drought stress caused by saltwater intrusion or freshwater deficit in sand dunes or coral reefs, and thus the identification of stress-relevant genes in this species is quite necessary.;  Additionally, the genome provides a source for mining the genetic resources, including LEA/ASR genes, of C. rosea plants, which have evolved to survive under extreme stress.; In addition, ASRs and dehydrins have been reported to be crucial in the tolerance to different abiotic stresses, including drought, high salinity/alkaline, or extreme temperatures [11,41]. The LEA_4 subfamily has been suggested to have a close association with the evolution of desiccation tolerance in plants [20]. In this study, we paid special attention to the promoter regions of CrASRs (three members), CrDHNs (five members), and CrLEA_4s (two members).;  We summarized the abiotic stress-related cis-regulatory elements (including MYB, MYC, as-1, ABRE, MBS, ERE, LTR, and TC-rich repeats) within these 10 CrASR and CrLEA promoter regions (Figure 5B).;  The categories and numbers of these elements suggested that the mechanisms regulating CrASR and CrLEA expression are involved in stress responses.;  As these genes had a high number of cis-regulatory elements related to ABA and drought stress responses, they were also selected for further functional analysis to obtain their detailed functions and regulatory mechanisms.; Based on reports on the different LEA numbers involved in abiotic stresses [8,11,20,41,42,43,44,45], with reference to the RNA-Seq results and the promoter region analysis, we further identified 10 genes (including three CrASRs, five CrDHNs, and two CrLEA_4s) for expression analysis in different C. rosea tissues.;  Our aim was to examine the spatio-temporal patterns of these genes under various abiotic stress conditions and ABA treatment, from which we simulated the stressful conditions of the tropical coral reef in the laboratory, as far as possible.;  It has been proved that plant ASRs are closely related with water deficit stress and drought tolerance [11,41], and the dehydrins play fundamental roles in plant response and adaptation to salinity and dehydration stresses [8,42]. LEA_4 genes, also known as group 3 [8], have been proved being strongly associated with drought tolerance in basal and angiosperm resurrection plants via ABA signaling pathway [20]. The RNA-Seq analysis showed that nine of these 10 genes displayed higher expression levels in the YX leaf sample than in the SCBG leaf sample (except for CrASR2).;  The qRT-PCR analysis showed that all 10 genes were induced by different stresses or ABA in different organs to various degrees, while their expression levels were specific and variable (Figure 7).;  The mannitol stress (simulated drought) and ABA treatment caused significantly higher expression induction than the high salinity and alkaline treatments.;  Generally, alkaline stress showed a slighter effect than the other three treatments.;  Distinctively, CrLEA4-1 and CrLEA4-2 were significantly induced in all C. rosea tissues with the mannitol stress and ABA treatment, and the transcripts of CrLEA4-2 showed a significant increase in the roots of C. rosea under high salt treatment (Figure 7A).;  Based on the above analysis, the results of the qRT-PCR are basically consistent with the results of the RNA-Seq analysis pertaining to the different habitats, and we propose that these genes may play important roles in the response of C. rosea to abiotic stress and adaptation to the extreme environment in the coral reef.; Quantitative RT-PCR detection of the expression levels of the 10 CrLEA/CrASR genes responding to different stresses (600 mM NaCl, 150 mM NaHCO3, 300 mM mannitol, or 100 mM ABA) in C. rosea seedling plants. (A) 3 CrASRs and 2 CrLEA_4s. (B) 5 CrDHNs.; Combined with our transcriptional analyses and promoter regions’ prediction, we could conclude preliminarily that these 10 CrLEAs and CrASRs (three CrASRs, five CrDHNs, and two CrLEA_4s) are closely related with the adaptation to abiotic stresses in C. rosea, especially to high salinity, alkaline, or water deficit, etc.;  To identify their potential roles in vivo, we performed a series of heterogeneous expression assays of the above 10 genes in a yeast system for functional stress tolerance investigation.;  Due to the highly hydrophilic features and putative antioxidative abilities of CrLEAs and CrASRs, we also tested several other abiotic stress tolerances in the yeast WT strain (Figure 8B, upper).;  In Figure 8B with respect to salt stress, the majority of the above 10 genes showed elevated salinity tolerance in yeast than empty vector pYES2, while the effects varied.;  The expression of all 10 genes elevated the alkaline stress tolerance of the yeast.;  Furthermore, most of the 10 CrLEAs and CrASRs could increase the high osmotic stress tolerance of yeast when expressed in the WT strain (Figure 8B, lower).;  Although these yeast stress tolerance results are preliminary, and a few members even showed no significant effects against some stress challenges, there is still need for further functional identification in plants using transgenic systems.; The tolerance confirmations of the 3 CrASRs, 5 CrDHNs, and 2 CrLEA_4s heteroexpression in yeast. (A) H2O2 oxidative stress tolerance confirmations in yeast. (B) Salt, alkaline, cadmium, and high osmotic tolerance confirmations in yeast.;  The stress factors with different concentrations were showed in figures.; Due to the significant roles of LEA and ASR proteins in water deficit stress responses and ROS scavenging abilities, they are believed to act in multiple developmental processes and in response to various stresses, as indicated in a number of previous reports [1,2,3,9]. As C. rosea is a halophyte with the typical features of high salt/alkaline and drought tolerance, it is necessary to systematically investigate the potential role of LEA/ASRs, especially given the lack of studies on LEA/ASR genes in legumes (Fabaceae).;  It is believed that C. rosea has developed a series of sophisticated mechanisms at multiple levels to cope with stress, including morphological, physiological, and genetic changes and adaptations, ultimately regulating the expression of stress-responsive genes through complex networks.;  The downstream responsive genes include some water stress-related genes, such as LEAs or ASRs, aquaporins, or ROS-producing and scavenging genes.; LEA protein genes, which were first identified on account of their marked transcript accumulation in embryos for coping with rapid dehydration during seed maturation [15], were later found to be induced in vegetative plant tissues under environmental stress conditions.;  ASR genes, which encode hydrophilic proteins or transcription factors, were first identified from a tomato cDNA library and participated in response to water-stressed conditions both in stressed leaves and in ripe fruits [41]. LEA proteins constitute a large multigene family that is closely related to the response to abiotic stresses in multiple plant species and that protects cells against water deficit caused by drought and other stresses.;  Both LEAs and ASRs are known to participate in multiple developmental processes and in response to various stresses, mainly water shortage challenges.;  Subcellular localization prediction revealed that the CrLEA/CrASR proteins were present in all subcellular compartments, which is consistent with the functional prediction that LEA/ASR proteins in principal groups are ubiquitous within cells and are required in all cellular compartments responding to abiotic stress [49]. We also predicted the 3D structures and calculated the disordered amino acid contents of all CrLEA/CrASR proteins, and the results indicated that except CrLEA_2 and CrSMP subfamilies, the other proteins showed obviously disordered structures (Figures S1 and S2).;  Furthermore, previous studies have indicated that plant stress-responsive genes without or with few introns could reduce the time required from transcription to translation, therefore providing good adaptation abilities for plants responding to changes in environments and habitats [46]. Combined with the CrLEA/CrASR gene structure and protein motif, we can infer that CrLEA/CrASR proteins are evolutionarily conserved, and their functions have group specificity.;  The other segmental duplications occurring in CrLEA_1, CrLEA_3, CrLEA_4, and CrLEA_5 indicated that these LEA genes might participate in the adaptive evolution of C. rosea to water shortage stresses by increasing their gene numbers.; As LEAs have been confirmed to endow plants with a variety of abiotic and biological stress tolerances, LEA families often have multiple copies of LEA genes in various plant species for that very reason.;  Our statistical analysis results of the promotors of CrLEAs/CrASRs showed that most of the promoter regions contained cis-regulatory elements, such as ABRE, MYC, MYB, MBS, TC-rich repeats, and several hormone-related responsive elements, suggesting that these genes could be regulated or affected by different stresses (Figure 5A).;  The contribution of single CrLEA or CrASR genes to the stress tolerance and environmental adaptation of C. rosea needs to be further explored. ; We also used qRT-PCR to investigate the expression patterns of 10 candidate genes in C. rosea plants under salt, alkaline, high osmotic treatment, and ABA stresses.;  Detailed expression profiles of these 10 CrLEA/CrASR genes revealed that most were significantly up-regulated after the high osmotic stress (NaCl or mannitol) or ABA treatment, while the alkaline stress showed the least impact on the expression changes of candidate genes (Figure 7).;  This result is consistent with several previous reports of LEA genes in other plant species, in which their expression was also greatly affected by abiotic stress challenges and hormone treatments [19,48,50]. The relevant roles of ASRs, DHNs, or the LEA_4s subfamily genes during plant stress tolerance have been reported in earlier studies using various techniques [11,20,42]. Here both the RNA-Seq and the qRT-PCR results indicated that these genes might be vital factors influencing the adaptability of C. rosea plants to salt/alkaline and drought stresses in tropical or subtropical coastal regions.; The accumulation of LEA proteins in cells is crucial for the response of organisms to different abiotic stresses.;  It exhibits excellent salt tolerance and drought resistance, and the induction of IpLEAs in yeast obviously improved the salt and oxidative stress tolerance of yeast clones [51]. Prior studies revealed that some LEA genes from Dendrobium officinale were able to enhance the cellular tolerance to high temperature and salt stresses of E. coli cells [49]. For ASR genes, our previous research also demonstrated that an I. pes-caprae ASR gene, IpASR, could improve salinity and drought tolerance in transgenic E. coli and Arabidopsis [45]. In summary, LEA and ASR genes are pertinent research subjects in plant stress physiology and are mainly involved in drought or salinity tolerance in plants.;  Here, we identified and characterized 10 CrLEA/CrASR genes in C. rosea for the first time and performed functional verification in yeast to investigate bioactivities for abiotic stress resistance.;  The majority of the 10 tested genes elevated the high salinity, alkaline, and high osmotic stress tolerance of yeast compared with the empty vector control, while some even showed heavy metal Cd tolerance, but not significantly so (Figure 8B).;  Our results demonstrated that these CrLEA/CrASR genes may play protective roles in cells under water-deficit conditions caused by high salt/alkaline and high osmotic stresses, and they also could improve cell survival via their antioxidant capacities or metal chelating abilities.;  This indicated that CrASR1 could act as a transcriptional regulator together with chaperone-like proteins or hydrophilins, like other LEA/ASR proteins [11,34]. Previous studies have proved that tomato ASR1 is a drought stress-responsive transcription factor, and its consensus ASR1-binding motif was enriched in some specific tomato genomic loci, possibly containing several aquaporin genes [12,52]. A recent study on CaASR1 in another Solanaceae species, Capsicum annuum, also provided evidence that CaASR1 could interact with the transcription factor CabZIP63 and is a positive regulator of the defense response of pepper to the pathogen R. solanacearum, probably by acting as a transcription activator [53]. Our results strongly suggest that CrASR1 showed quite different features from the other two CrASRs or CrLEAs (Figure 8 and Figure 9), and this protein might fulfill an important function in salt/drought tolerance and regulate the environmental adaptation of C. rosea to tropical coastal regions, although more research is needed for further clarification.; The responses of the CrLEA and CrASR genes to different stresses and hormone treatments were investigated.;  In brief, for high salinity stress, the C. rosea seedlings were removed from the pots and carefully washed with distilled water to remove soil from the roots, following which they were transferred into 600 mM NaCl solution; for salt-alkaline stress, the cleaned C. rosea seedlings were soaked in a 150 mM NaHCO3 (pH 8.2) solution; for the drought treatment, the seedlings were soaked in a 300 mM mannitol solution; and for abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, a freshly prepared working solution of 100 μM exogenous ABA was sprayed onto the leaves of the C. rosea seedlings.;  The second and/or third mature leaves from the shoot apexes were collected at 0, 2, and 24 h during the stress treatments, and the starting point (0 h) was used as the control.;  The stress- and hormone-related cis-regulatory elements included light response elements, gibberellin-responsive elements, methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-responsive elements, auxin response elements, salicylic acid responsiveness elements, ABA response elements (ABRE), ethylene response elements (ERE), MYC transcription factor binding elements (MYC), MYB transcription factor binding elements (MYB and MBS), TC-rich repeats, LTR, and as-1.;  These elements are believed to be involved in plant responses to dehydration, low temperature, salt stress, and other abiotic stresses (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/, accessed on 1 March 2021).;  Total RNA was extracted from the C. rosea seedling roots, vines, and leaves under the stress/ABA treatment and unstressed treatment using an RNA plant extraction kit (Magen, Biotech, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and approximately 1 μg of purified total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA in a 20 μL reaction volume using AMV reverse transcriptase (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) according to the supplier’s instructions.;  In brief, total RNA was extracted from C. rosea seedling tissues under the stress/ABA treatments and reverse transcribed into cDNA.;  In short, the PCR fragments were inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pYES2 and after sequencing confirmation, these recombinant expression vectors were transformed into different yeast strains to verify the stress tolerance functions.;  A synthetic defined (SD) yeast medium without uracil (SD-Ura) containing 2% (w/v) galactose (Gal) was used as the yeast induction medium (SDG-Ura) during the salt/alkaline tolerance and oxidative stress experiments on solid medium for the localization observations.;  The concentrations of the different stress factors are indicated in the figure legends.;  The CrLEA/CrASR superfamily was involved in the adaptation of C. rosea to different habitats, and 10 of the CrLEA/CrASR members showed obvious differences in gene expression in response to salt/alkaline stress, high osmotic stress, or ABA treatment.;  This systematic study provides new information on the LEA/ASR superfamily in C. rosea and further expands our understanding of the association of CrLEA/CrASR genes with natural ecological adaptability and abiotic stress responses in C. rosea.;  Our findings should also inform the genetic improvement of other legume plants or crops and provide candidate stress-resistance genes for future research."

"abiotic stress","D000079225",34256694,8278772," Seawater and drought tolerance in this species may be facilitated by aquaporins (AQPs), channel proteins that transport water and small molecules across cell membranes and thereby maintain cellular water homeostasis in the face of abiotic stress.;  We also investigated the expression profiles of CrAQP genes in various tissues, in response to different abiotic stressors, and in different habitats, along with promoter analyses.;  In addition, because PIPs play an important roles in maintaining water balance in plant cells, we summarized the abiotic stress-related cis-acting elements (including ABRE, ERE, MYB, MBS, TC-rich repeats, and MYC) within 11 CrPIP promoter regions (Fig. 4b).; We performed a gene expression analysis on different C. rosea tissues to examine the expression patterns of CrPIP genes under various abiotic stress conditions and an ABA hormone treatment.;  These results indicate the role these genes play in multiple abiotic stress responses and ABA signaling response in C. rosea.; Water deficit—caused by drought, high salinity/alkaline, high temperature, cold/freezing conditions or other abiotic stressors—can negatively affect plant growth and survival.;  This is largely because AQP genes are seen as candidates for use in genetic modification of crops to increase agricultural productivity [39, 40]. The saltbush Atriplex canescens is highly tolerant of saline-alkaline soils, drought, heavy metals, and cold, and the AQP genes AcPIP2 and AcNIP5;1 have been shown to be involved in abiotic stress tolerance in this species, and their overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis caused altered tolerance to drought and salt [41, 42]. Compared with cultivated soybean, the wild Glycine soja is relatively salt-alkaline tolerant.; Plant AQPs play versatile physiological roles in combatting abiotic stress, not only by regulating water content and potential, but also by transporting certain signaling molecules and nutrients.; Canavalia rosea is a salt- and alkaline-tolerant and drought-adapted halophyte, and abiotic stressors, such as saline-alkaline soil, seasonal drought, strong solar irradiance, and high temperatures, are the main limiting factors that induce osmotic stress and disturb water balance for this species and other tropical seaside plants.;  For regulating the water transport under different abiotic stresses efficiently, plant often changes the expression of aquaporin genes through a series of complex steps to control the water uptake or management.;  However, the water management effectiveness and patterns could always depending on the plant growth conditions or tissue type, as well as the different types or degrees of water stress and the specificity of AQP members [54]. In plant, the PIP isoforms were supposed to playing major roles in maintaining plant water homeostasis and responses to abiotic stress [11, 55]. Gene transcript levels are dependent upon the structures of their promoters.;  We summarized the abiotic stress-related cis-acting elements in CrAQP promoters (Fig. 4) and our findings suggest diversity in CrAQP expression patterns, which could be also considered as a part of the adaptation mechanisms to stress conditions.; In our previous research, we have characterized CrPIP2;3 as a salt/drought stress related gene [36]. Here we performed protein–protein interaction studies using yeast two-hybrid assays and found that two CrPIP members, encoded by CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3, that were highly expressed in all tested tissues and almost constitutively expressed under the abiotic stress challenges and ABA treatment (Figs. 5a and ​and6).6).;  The overexpression of CrPIP1;5 in transgenic Arabidopsis is in contrast to most previous findings [40, 54], suggesting that overexpression of plant PIPs results in specificities of abiotic stress tolerance or sensitivity, which also might be attributed to the protein interaction, post-translational modifications (PTM), protein trafficking of the foreign AQP.;  That, combined with our previous related research about CrPIP2;3 [36], suggested that overexpression of these two PIP genes in transgenic Arabidopsis promoted plant responses to abiotic stressors by maintaining water homeostasis, as well as decreasing the damage caused by water-deficit stress.;  Expression profiling of CrAQPs revealed higher expression of PIP-associated genes in almost every tissue of C. rosea plants, suggesting that this subfamily likely plays important roles in developmental processes and abiotic stress responses.;  The cis-acting elements were classified as either hormone-specific (gibberellin-responsive elements, MeJA-responsive elements, auxin-responsive elements, salicylic acid-responsive elements, EREs, and ABREs) or abiotic stress-responsive (light responsive elements, MYCs, MYBs, MBSs, TC-rich repeats, and LTREs).;  Additionally, root length was calculated to evaluate the influence of the overexpression of CrPIP1;5 on transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings under abiotic stress (100 mM, 150 mM, and 200 mM NaCl for salt stress; 0.5 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 99.5 mmol/L NaCl, 0.75 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 99.25 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 99 mmol/L NaCl, pH 8.2 for alkaline stress; 200 mM, 300 mM, and 400 mM mannitol for osmotic stress."

evaluated.;  Glycerol
at 15 or 25 wt % led to a significant reduction in recovered colonies.
Conversely, none of the polymers showed toxicity to the E.

of the polymers means that more and healthier colonies can grow post-thaw,

showed that similar numbers of bacteria with intact membranes are
recovered for both systems but that the polymer cryoprotectants lead
to more viable colonies, suggesting their lower toxicity is crucial.

"stress","D000079225 ",35052375,8774410," Promoter analyses of cis-regulatory elements indicated that the expression of different CrNHXs was affected by a series of stress challenges.;  Furthermore, in the single-factor stress treatments mimicking the extreme environments of tropical coral reefs, the RNA-seq data also implied CrNHXs holding possible gene-specific regulatory roles in the environmental adaptation.;  The qRT-PCR based expression profiling exhibited that CrNHXs responded to different stresses to varying degrees, which further confirmed the specificity of CrNHXs’ in responding to abiotic stresses.; High salinity stress is one of the main abiotic stress factors affecting plant growth and development, thereby posing a great threat to the sustainable development of agriculture and food security.;  It has been estimated that nearly 10% of the total land surface (950 Mha) and about 50% of all irrigated land (230 Mha) are salt-affected, therefore drastically reducing agricultural productivity and altering the geographical distribution of crops [1,2]. Salinity primarily causes ionic stress and osmotic stress in plants.;  The resulting salinity-induced water stress, oxidative stress, nutritional imbalances, ion toxicity, and disruption of metabolic processes restrict the normal growth of plants [3,4]. During the process of evolution, plants have developed multiple mechanisms involving genes and strategies at the physiological, molecular, and metabolic levels to improve salt resistance in various ways.;  To cope with salt stress, plants have evolved three distinct responses, including osmotic stress tolerance, sodium ion (Na+) or chloride ion (Cl−) exclusion, and the accumulation of Na+ or Cl− in the tissues [5]. Therefore, it is suggested that some membrane proteins, including transporters or channels, play critical roles in maintaining ion homeostasis and osmotic adjustment, and regulating pH for plant survival under abiotic stress, such as high salinity/alkaline and drought.; Numerous reports have confirmed the involvement of NHX proteins in salinity stress responses [8]. Based on the released genome sequences of various plant species, genome-wide analyses of NHX families have recently gained remarkable traction in investigations of plant salt and alkaline tolerance mechanisms.;  Research on NHX genes in halophytes, xerophytes, or even extremophiles would improve the understanding of the adaptation of plants to environmental stress and provide a good foundation for formulating effective measures to modify the tolerance of crops to external stresses [17,18,19]. In recent years, the functional identification of NHX families from different plant species has broadly indicated that the NHX families are crucial for ion homeostasis, cellular pH regulation, plant development, vesicle trafficking, and salt-tolerance in plants.;  The seeds were germinated and cultivated in soil/vermiculite mixture for one month to perform various abiotic stresses for the transcriptional analyses of CrNHX members.;  For high salinity, alkaline, drought stress, and heat treatments, seedlings were soaked in 600 mM NaCl, 150 mM NaHCO3 (pH 8.2), 300 mM mannitol solutions, and 45 °C pre-warmed half-strength Hoagland’s solution, respectively.;  Second, the C. rosea seedling tissues under different abiotic stress challenges mentioned above (including 600 mM NaCl, 150 mM NaHCO3 (pH 8.2), 300 mM mannitol solutions, and 45 °C pre-warmed half-strength Hoagland’s solution) were also sequenced at the transcriptome level, with the same above RNA isolation, library construction, cDNA sequencing, and gene read alignment procedures.;  These four types of stress treatments were used for simulating the high salinity, alkaline, drought, and heat environmental conditions on tropical coral reefs.;  Then, the cells were serially diluted in 10-fold steps, and 2-μL aliquots of each were finally spotted onto APG medium (arginine phosphate medium, supplied with 2% galactose) plates [37] with or without different concentrations of NaCl, KCl, or hygromycin B stressors.;  We particularly focused on the hormone-responsive cis-regulatory elements (gibberellin-responsive element, MeJA (methyl jasmonate)-responsiveness element, auxin-responsive element, salicylic acid responsiveness, ethylene-responsive ERE, and ABA-responsive element ABRE) and abiotic stresses cis-regulatory elements (light-responsive element, MYC, and MYB), and other cellular functioning related cis-regulatory elements (ERE, MBS, and TC-rich repeats) were specially identified.;  The most frequent abiotic stress-related elements were MYB and ABRE (Figure 4B), which further indicated that the CrNHXs were responsible for various stresses, including drought, high salinity, or other temperature abnormalities.;  The cis-regulatory element analysis data suggested that CrNHX genes might respond to multiple hormones and abiotic stresses, thus playing a role in high salinity/alkaline stress adaptation in C. rosea.;  ABRE: ABA-responsive element; ERE: ethylene-responsive element; MYB: MYB transcription factor (TF) binding site confirmed in Arabidopsis; MBS: MYB TF binding site involved in drought-inducibility; TC-rich repeat: cis-acting element involved in defense and stress responsiveness; MYC: MYC TF binding site confirmed in Arabidopsis.; To further verify that CrNHXs are involved in the specific responses of C. rosea plants to different stresses, we analyzed the transcriptional expression of CrNHXs under high salinity/alkaline, high osmotic stress, and heat treatment, to mimic each single stress factor in the specialized habitat of the tropical coral reef as closely as possible.;  As shown in Figure 7 and Figure S4, the expression of eight CrNHXs showed different patterns (upregulated or downregulated) under these stress challenges in the seedling roots and leaves.;  In general, the expression of CrNHXs in the C. rosea seedlings showed more obvious transcriptional changes under high salinity stress than under alkaline or high osmosis stresses, which might be closely related to their biochemical functions being ion channels.;  In the root, after 2 h of salt stress, CrNHX5 and CrNHX7 were obviously induced (by 33.71 and 136.83%), while the expression of CrNHX4 was downregulated (by −42.95%); high alkaline stress only induced CrNHX7 expression (by 35.21%) and decreased the expression of CrNHX3-1 (by −48.98%), CrNHX4 (by −90.09%), and CrNHX4-1 (by −57.71%) in the root at the 2 h time point, while high osmotic stress also greatly decreased the expression of CrNHX3-1 (by −39.85%) and CrNHX4 (by −60.95%) at 2 h in root (Figure 7A).;  In contrast, high salt stress for 2 h caused the decreased expression of CrNHX5 (by −39.24%) and CrNHX7 (by –32.48%) in the leaf samples, as well as the high alkaline challenge (by −43.02% and −40.13%, respectively); the high osmotic stress also obviously decreased the expression of CrNHX5 (by −43.30%) in C. rosea leaf at the 2 h time point (Figure 7B).;  In the root, after 48 h of salt change, only CrNHX5 showed obviously upregulated expression patterns (by 62.59%), while the high alkaline and osmotic stresses caused irregular transcriptional changes (Figure 7C).;  Comparatively, in the leaf after a 48 h stress challenge, the expression of four CrNHXs was affected, and CrNHX5 showed an obviously upregulated expression pattern (by 97.41, 69.65, and 79.74%, respectively); CrNHX1 showed an obviously downregulated expression pattern responding to these three challenges (by –99.33%, −81.24%, and −89.25%, respectively).;  The expression of CrNHX3-1 was decreased by high salt stress (by −72.03%), while the expression of CrNHX7 was slightly induced by high alkaline and osmotic stresses (by 54.26 and 16.23%) (Figure 7D).;

(A,B) The expression differences of eight CrNHXs in the root (A) and leaf (B) after 2 h abiotic stress challenge; (C,D) the expression differences of eight CrNHXs in the root (C) and leaf (D) after 48 h abiotic stress challenge.; Heat stress can cause cellular metabolic disorders and even the death of plants.;  Our results showed that the expression levels of most CrNHXs were lower after 2 h heat stress (HS) than in the controls (Figure 8), which indicated that this gene family might respond to heat stress by decreasing its transcription, thereby coping with energy imbalances and metabolic disorders.;  In general, our RNA-seq results demonstrated that this gene family might be involved in multiple stresses and may play different roles in these stresses.; (A) Heatmaps showing the expression levels of the eight CrNHXs under heat shock stress.;  Asterisks indicate significant differences from the CK (control check, without heat stress, Student’s t-test, * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01).;  The RNA was isolated from the leaf and root tissues at 2 h or 48 h after the same stress treatment that the RNA-seq assays were initiated.;  The results of the qRT-PCR analysis showed that seven CrNHXs responded to different stresses to varying degrees, and similarly, the expression of CrNHXs under salt stress was more greatly regulated in both the root and leaf samples, and the alkali stress also resulted in variable expression patterns of several CrNHX members, such as CrNHX1 and CrNHX4.;  In brief, after 2 h challenges, the expression of CrNHX1 was obviously induced by high salinity, alkaline, and high osmotic stress both in root (by 689.86, 187.53 and 118.38%) and in leaf (by 317.30, 494.99 and 120.95%), while the expression of CrNHX4 was only induced in leaf by salt, alkaline, and high osmotic stresses, till 541.22, 588.62 and 695.85%, respectively.;  The alkaline stress induced the expression of CrNHX6/7 in root (by 90.31 and 129.24%) and CrNHX4-1 in leaf (by 172.93%) under short-term challenge.;  After 48 h challenges, the expression of CrNHX1 was greatly induced by salt and alkaline in root, and the expression levels reached to almost 17 and 18-fold changes (by 1574.74 and 1661.48% increasing), while in leaf tissue, the expression of CrNHX1, CrNHX3-1, CrNHX4, and CrNHX4-1 was all decreased greatly in different levels, while the high salinity and osmotic stresses strongly induced the expression of CrNHX5 (by 155.31 and 79.36%), as well as the expression of CrNHX6 (by 194.91 and 73.11%).;  Under high osmosis treatment, in the leaf sample, both CrNHX1/4 and CrNHX5/6 showed a time-dependent induced expression pattern, indicating that these genes might play important roles under drought stress.;  In conclusion, our results suggested that this CrNHX family presented different expression patterns in response to abiotic stresses, which are representative conditions of the ecological environments on tropical coral reefs, indicating the specificity of CrNHXs in different physiological processes or tissue types or the involvement of CrNHXs in the ecological adaptation of C. rosea plants to high salinity/alkali and extreme drought.; Quantitative RT-PCR detection of the expression levels of the eight CrNHXs responding to different stresses (600 mM NaCl, 150 mM NaHCO3, and 300 mM mannitol) in C. rosea seedlings of (A) root samples under 2 h stress challenges; (B) leaf samples under 2 h stress challenges; (C) root samples under 48 h stress challenges; and (D) leaf samples under 48 h stress challenges.;  This mutant strain is highly sensitive to Na+ stress and is relatively sensitive to K+ and hygromycin B stress when grown on AP medium plate [48]. The corresponding wild-type strain W303 was set as a positive control.;  The results showed that the transformed AXT3 lines expressing these genes grew much better than the AXT3 mutant transformed with the empty vector pYES2 under 6, 8, 10, and 12 mM NaCl stress (Figure 10A), with the wild-type strain control W303 always growing well.; Complementation of yeast mutants on solid medium containing different concentrations of stress factors.; Climate change is causing rising sea levels and increased drought, thereby elevating salinization in many regions of the world [49]. Salinity is a key environmental factor and one of the most important abiotic stresses affecting physiological pathways and inhibiting development and growth in plants.;  To tolerate salt stress, plants have developed a series of physiological, biochemical, and ecological strategies.;  Halophytes are likely to possess some morphological, physiological, or molecular mechanisms associated with development and growth regulation that have evolved as adaptive responses to salt tolerance [38]. In general, halophytes can adjust osmotically to the surrounding high salinity by accumulating ions and sequestering them into the vacuoles or out of the cytoplasm to maintain cellular water or solute homeostasis and to prevent adverse effects on metabolism [51]. It is well documented that NHX proteins are involved in salinity tolerance by mediating Na+ transport, K+ homeostasis, pH regulation, and cellular vesicle trafficking, thereby regulating the ion balance in plants under salt stress [52].; It has been confirmed that plant NHXs play vital roles in various cellular processes in response to high salinity stress conditions.;  These stress response mechanisms mainly involve H+-coupled cation transportation and cellular compartments regulated by NHXs and their interacting proteins, which produce channels across the membrane.;  It is thus of great importance to study how plants respond to high salinity/alkaline and related hyperosmotic or drought stresses with regard to growth, development, and even natural ecological adaptability.;  In this study, eight CrNHX genes were comprehensively investigated for the first time based on the C. rosea genome data, and the expression profiles of these CrNHXs were analyzed to explore their functions in the abiotic stress response in different C. rosea tissues.;  Some members identified from other plant species have been well characterized and are proved to be associated with salt tolerance in plants, mainly including NHX7/SOS1 genes in Arabidopsis [10], soybean [53], rice [54], cotton [55], and wheat [56]. Vac-NHX or Endo-NHX can form convenient channels for vacuolar or endomembrane system Na+/K+ sequestration, while PM-NHX is mainly responsible for the Na+/K+ efflux out of the cell in exchange for H+ influx into the cell [52,57]. Besides several Arabidopsis Vac-NHX or Endo-NHX members [12,13,14,15,16], some other Vac-NHX or Endo-NHX genes have been confirmed to be involved in the compartmentalization of Na+/K+ into the vacuoles or intracellular compartmentalization and are critical of salt tolerance in other plant species [48,58,59]. In recent years, the functional identification of NHX genes from plant species growing in specialized habitats has been explored, including in eremophytes and halophytes [60,61,62,63]. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which NHX family members are involved in salt tolerance and stress regulation will be of great significance for elucidating the environmental adaptation mechanisms of plants in specialized habitats.;  In this study, we mainly focused on some hormone-responsive and abiotic stress-related elements that have been confirmed in other plant species, and we propose that these elements hold some function similarities in C. rosea.;  The ABRE, MYC-, MYB-, and TC-rich repeat elements are believed to be involved in plant responses to dehydration, low temperature, salt stress, and other abiotic stresses.;  CrNHX1, CrNHX4-1, CrNHX6, and CrNHX7 harbored more stress-related cis-regulatory elements (dismissing the light response elements) (Figure 4), which might be the reason for these genes presenting significant transcriptional changes to abiotic stresses.;  ABA is a critical signaling hormone that adjusts the physiological or metabolic processes of plants in vivo in response to various environmental abiotic stresses [66], and ABREs are kind of the critical regulatory elements found in the promoters of stress-responsive genes.;  ABFs belong to the basic-domain leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription family and induce the transcriptional activation of the stress-inducible genes [67]. Seven of the CrNHX promoters (except CrNHX3-1) contained one or more ABREs, indicating that these CrNHXs might be involved in the ABA signal pathway.;  Although fewer cis-regulatory elements (including ABREs) were found in the promoter of CrNHX3-1, combined with our RNA-seq results, it was also speculated that this gene might be expressed consistently to maintain its transcription at a certain high level (Figure 5 and Figure 6) and that other regulatory mechanisms might exist in the stress responsiveness of CrNHX3-1 (Figure 7 and Figure 8).; At the genetic level, except for the gene structure (including promoter sequences), transcriptional regulation is the most direct method that directly reflects the biological functions of genes, which have been confirmed as being involved in various biological processes, such as hormonal responses, abiotic stress responses, and development in plants.;  The differential expression of CrNHXs might be associated with Na+ and K+/H+ absorption and transport in different habitats, and the lower expression level of CrNHXs in coastal C. rosea plants might be an adaptive mechanism to deal with intracellular and extracellular high salinity/alkaline stress, while the transcriptional characteristics of CrNHXs in YX-native C. rosea plant roots are unclear and need further clarification.; Given the extreme salt/alkaline, drought, and heat environment on YX Island, we mimicked the main stress factors to detect the expression patterns of CrNHXs, including high salinity, alkaline, high osmosis, and heat stress.;  In general, the transcript changes in the root of the CrNHXs showed more variability than that in the leaves under different abiotic stress challenges (Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure S4).;  This can be attributed to the fact that in the roots the high salinity/alkaline was stronger and more direct, which might result in the immediate promotion of cellular Na+/K+ distribution in the root, while in the leaf, the transcriptional response was slow until 48 h, and CrNHX5 and CrNHX6 demonstrated induced expression after those abiotic stress challenges (Figure 7 and Figure 8).;  In the stressful habitat, the CrNHXs members in different parts of the plant might be subject to different regulatory mechanisms and then play differentiating roles in regulating the translocation of the saline ions.; Over-expression in yeast systems is widely used to study the function of genes under biotic stresses.;  Among them, Na+ toxicity is a principal cause of the deleterious effects associated with salinity stress, whereas H+ is essential for balancing cellular acid-alkali levels.;  In contrast to MnNHXs in mulberry [48], two Vac-type CrNHXs, CrNHX1 and CrNHX3, showed greatly enhanced tolerance to salt-stress (Na+/K+ tolerance) compared to the two Endo-type CrNHXs (CrNHX5 and CrNHX6) and PM-type CrNHX7, and the hygromycin B tolerance seemed to be similar (Figure 10C).;  Further detailed analysis of expression profiles for CrNHXs performed using RNA-seq data, as well as using the heterologous expression assays with the yeast system to investigate the transporting activities of several CrNHXs, proved that this family is involved in salt/alkaline stress responses and plays vital roles in ecological adaptability for natural extreme adversity on tropical coral islands and reefs.;  Figure S4: The FPKM values histogram of RNA-seq data for C. rosea seedlings under different abiotic stress challenges (600 mM NaCl, 150 mM NaHCO3, and 300 mM mannitol).

As sessile organisms, plants cannot avoid HS and are inevitably exposed to complex environmental stimuli [3]. Plants have evolved a series of physiological and molecular strategies to accommodate these stresses over long lifespans, and one of the most important aspects for plants to survive environmental adversity is to maintain cellular homeostasis under stress [4]. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are molecular chaperones that have been proven to mediate various plant stress responses and regulate plant growth and development.;  The hormone response elements included gibberellic acid (GA) response, methyl jasmonate (MeJA) response, salicylic acid (SA) response, abscisic acid (ABA) response (ABRE), and ethylene response (ERE); the stress response elements included low-temperature responsive (LTR), elicitor responsive (AT-rich sequence), defense and stress responsive (TC-rich sequence), and pathogen-inducible (as-1); the transcript factor (TF) binding sites included MYB (flavonoid biosynthesis binding site, light binding site, and drought inducible), MYC (dehydration or other abiotic stresses responsive), and Hsf-binding heat shock elements (HSEs).; Heat shock for 2 h significantly induced the expression of more than half of the CrHsp20 members in the C. rosea seedlings (Figure 7), and the transcripts of the CrHsp20s increased by tens of thousands-fold in both the roots and in the leaves, while several CrHsp20s showed slightly downregulated expression patterns in response to heat, including CrHsp20-1, CrHsp20-15, CrHsp20-18, CrHsp20-19, CrHsp20-21, CrHsp20-22, CrHsp20-23, CrHsp20-24, CrHsp20-32, CrHsp20-33, CrHsp20-36, CrHsp20-38, and CrHsp20-41.;  Skn7Δ has been confirmed as being sensitive to acute heat stress, probably by acting together with yeast heat shock factors [37]. The skn7Δ cells expressing seven CrHsp20s always survived better than those harboring pYES2 (Figure 9), indicating that CrHsp20s, being molecular chaperones, are thought to protect the cell during exposure to lethal heat stress, although their exact function remains unclear.;  Heat stress often occurs quickly, which inevitably leads to the immediate initiation of heat shock and the induction of gene expression [47,48]. Combined with the physicochemical characteristics of CrHsp20 members (Table 1), about 78% of protein members were unstable (II > 40), and the majority of the CrHsp20s were hydrophilic in nature (GRAVY < 0).;  Thus, the cis-acting elements in promoter regions play significant roles in gene regulation and expression, and the well-regulated promoters or cis-acting elements are strongly required for the engineering of transgenic plants to achieve the controlled expression level of target genes [33]. Investigation of cis-acting elements of CrHsp20 promoter regions indicates that several stress-responsive elements, such as ABRE (ABA responsive element), HSE (heat shock elements), MYB (Myb-binding element), and MYC (Myc-binding element) (Figure 4), are abundant in the promoter regions of most CrHsp20s, thereby further defining their possible roles as stress-responsive genes."

As sessile organisms, plants cannot avoid HS and are inevitably exposed to complex environmental stimuli [3]. Plants have evolved a series of physiological and molecular strategies to accommodate these stresses over long lifespans, and one of the most important aspects for plants to survive environmental adversity is to maintain cellular homeostasis under stress [4]. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are molecular chaperones that have been proven to mediate various plant stress responses and regulate plant growth and development.;  Hsps participate in the folding, localization, repairing, and degradation of proteins in all living organisms and play different roles in protein homeostasis under diverse stresses [5].;  The NTD participates in substrate binding and the ACD is involved in substrate interactions, while the CTE is responsible for homo-oligomerization [11]. In general, plant Hsp20s can function as molecular chaperones by binding to partially folded or denatured proteins to prevent proteins from irreversible aggregation and keep them stable, thereby preventing damage to proteins caused by environmental stresses.;  Thus, Hsp20s play important roles in various biotic and abiotic stress responses.; In plants, Hsp20s are divided into various subfamilies (CI-CVI, MTI, MTII, ER, CP, and PX) mainly based on their subcellular localization, sequence homology, and function [7]. The CI-CVI subfamilies are located in the cytoplasm or nucleus; MTI and MTII might work in mitochondrial organelles; and ER, CP, and PX might exist in the endoplasmic reticulum, chloroplasts, and peroxisomes, respectively [12]. In general, Hsp families in plants contain far more members than those in animals [6], which can be attributed to the fact that plants are sessile and have adapted over long periods to different stressful environments.;  Interestingly, the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) revealed by whole genome and transcriptome sequencing in some special-habitat plants have inspired significant research interest in recent years, mainly concerning the adaptation mechanisms regarding extreme adversity [18]. Recent achievements in ‘omics’ technologies are greatly facilitating the assessment of gene families in the regulatory adaptations underlying stress tolerance in plants [19]. Hsp20 families are essential components of plant tolerance under various abiotic stresses, and the Hsp20 gene family has been identified in some specialized-habitat plants, including switchgrass [20], willow [21], sorghum [22], and Sorbus pohuashanensis [23]. In addition, the functions of some specific plant Hsp20s have been further assessed using transgenic methods.;  For example, a cytosolic class I small Hsp from Rosa chinensis, RcHSP17.8, could enhance the thermotolerance and resistance to salt, drought, and osmotic stresses of transgenic microorganisms and Arabidopsis [24]. Overexpression of a wheat TaHSP23.9 in Arabidopsis showed improved heat and salt tolerance in the transgenic lines [25]. The heat-induced and chloroplast-localized sHsp gene from creeping bent grass, AsHSP26.8a, displayed slightly improved tolerance to drought, but demonstrated reduced tolerance to heat and salinity stresses when overexpressed in bent grass and Arabidopsis plants [26,27]. Overexpression of a pepper CaHSP16.4 gene enhanced tolerance to heat stress in Arabidopsis [28]. These studies have clearly demonstrated that Hsp20 genes are involved in regulating a diversity of responses to abiotic stresses, especially heat stress.;  In addition, several CrHsp20 genes in different sub-classes were transcriptionally confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) to evaluate the functions of CrHsp20 genes in growth, development, and stress responses, especially in the adaptive response to tropical reef ecological environments.;  The results of this study provide baseline information for the role of an important gene family in the adaptation of a leguminous species to heat, high salt/alkaline, and drought stress, and also offers a reference for gene evolution and function in response to abiotic stresses.;  These findings will also provide a basis for further functional analyses and for the breeding of stress-tolerant leguminous crops.; To understand the possible roles of the cis-regulatory elements of CrHsp20 genes relating to plant development and stress-specific responses, we analyzed the promoter region (comprising of −1000 bp upstream of the translation start site) of 41 CrHsp20s (Tables S4 and S5).;  Based on their predicted functions, the 12 identified cis-regulatory elements were classified into 3 groups, including hormone response, stress response, and transcript factor binding sites (Figure 4, Table S3).;  The hormone response elements included gibberellic acid (GA) response, methyl jasmonate (MeJA) response, salicylic acid (SA) response, abscisic acid (ABA) response (ABRE), and ethylene response (ERE); the stress response elements included low-temperature responsive (LTR), elicitor responsive (AT-rich sequence), defense and stress responsive (TC-rich sequence), and pathogen-inducible (as-1); the transcript factor (TF) binding sites included MYB (flavonoid biosynthesis binding site, light binding site, and drought inducible), MYC (dehydration or other abiotic stresses responsive), and Hsf-binding heat shock elements (HSEs).;  The abundance of different elements on each of the promoters is shown in different colors. (B) The location of abiotic stress-responding cis-acting elements (TC-rich repeats, MYB, MYC, HSE, and ABRE) in 41 CrHsp20 promoter regions.; The promoters of CrHsp20s contained a large number of hormone- and stress-related responsive cis-acting elements (ERE, ABRE, MYC, and MYB).;  Notably, C. rosea plants growing on tropical reefs exhibit better thermotolerance than most species, and so heat stress would be normal during their growth cycle, as would high salinity, alkaline, and drought stresses.;  Here we found that most of the promoter regions of the CrHsp20s processed a number of HSEs, ABREs, MYBs, and MYCs (Figure 4B), indicating that the expression of these gene families could be induced by heat or other stresses and that CrHsp20s might play multifarious protective roles by maintaining cellular homeostasis under different challenges.; Considering the complexity of the environmental conditions of XY, as well as the sampling of C. rosea tissues from Yongxing Island not being easy, we separately mimicked the main stressors of YX that could obviously affect plant growth and collected different tissues at different time points.;  These environmental stressors included: high salinity (600 mM NaCl), alkalinity (150 mM NaHCO3 pH 8.2), high osmotic stress (300 mM mannitol, mimicking drought/dehydration), and high temperature (45 °C).;  To analyze the CrHsp20s involved in the response of C. rosea to these abiotic stresses, we analyzed the RNA-Seq data to assess the expression levels of the 41 CrHsp20s in the roots and leaves during the response to salinity, alkalinity, high osmotic stress, and heat (Figure 6).; Heatmaps showing the expression patterns of the CrHsp20s under abiotic stress treatment (600 mM NaCl, 150 mM NaHCO3, pH 8.2, and 300 mM mannitol) in roots (A,B) and leaves (C,D) after 2 h challenge (A,C) or 48 h challenge (B,D).; Under high salinity stress, only some CrHsp20s (CrHsp20-8, CrHsp20-25, CrHsp20-26, and CrHsp20-28) showed obviously induced expression under a short-duration challenge in the C. rosea roots (2 h), while the levels of induction were further enhanced after a long-duration challenge (48 h).;  In the roots, alkaline stress also affected the expression of the CrHsp20 family; however, the influence was smaller than that of salt.;  Conversely, it appeared that high osmotic stress (drought) caused the most significant change in the C. rosea roots at both the time points of 2 h and 48 h, which indicates that the CrHsp20 genes are deeply involved in the response to water deficit in the roots of C. rosea (Figure 6A,B).;  In the leaves, the expression of the CrHsp20 family was almost not affected by these three challenges at 2 h, but with the increase in stress duration, these three stresses all caused upregulated expression patterns in some CrHsp20 members at 48 h, and the alkaline and high osmotic stresses seemed to have more influence than high salinity (Figure 6C,D).; Heatmap showing the expression patterns of the CrHsp20s under 2 h heat stress (45 °C) in leaf or root samples.;  R: roots; L: leaves; CK: control; HS: heat stress (45 °C).;  These CrHsp20s demonstrated obviously regulated transcriptional patterns during four types of abiotic stress challenge in previous transcriptome analysis (Figure 5B, Figure 6 and Figure 7), and their expression levels in the different tissues were further investigated with gene-specific qRT-PCR assay (Figure 8).;  The qRT-PCR results show that compared with the salt, alkaline, and high osmotic stresses (dozens to hundreds of times), all 14 transcripts accumulated greatly after the heat stress process (hundreds to thousands, even till to tens of thousands of times) (Figure 8).; Quantitative RT-PCR detection of the expression levels of the 14 CrHsp20s (CrHsp20-4, CrHsp20-5, CrHsp20-7, CrHsp20-8, CrHsp20-9, CrHsp20-10, CrHsp20-14, CrHsp20-25, CrHsp20-26, CrHsp20-27, CrHsp20-28, CrHsp20-31, CrHsp20-35, and CrHsp20-40) responding to different stresses (600 mM NaCl for salt stress, 150 mM NaHCO3 for alkaline stress, 300 mM mannitol for high osmotic stress, or heat stress at 45 °C) in C. rosea seedling plants.

(F) The expression patterns in leaves under high osmotic stress treatment. (G) The expression patterns in roots, stems, and leaves under heat stress.;  The alkaline stress drastically induced the expression of all 14 CrHsp20s both in the root and in the leaf, which indicates that these CrHsp20s are heavily involved in the response to alkaline toxicity (Figure 8C,D).;  Similarly, water deficit caused by high osmotic stress also induced the expression levels of CrHsp20s, and CrHsp20-8 presented the highest expression levels both in the roots and in the leaves (Figure 8E,F), suggesting that this gene plays important roles in the response to drought stress.;  Our qRT-PCR results also demonstrated that almost all these CrHsp20s (except CrHsp20-14) showed strikingly apparent expression induction in all three detected tissues (root, stem, and leaf), and their induction degree seemed to be the largest among these abiotic stresses (Figure 8G).;  Additionally, the immediate expression induction of CrHsp20s also matched the characteristics of Hsp20s being stress-responsive genes.; First, we performed the thermotolerance test for yeast strains overexpressing CrHsp20s, and the yeast cultures were subjected to 52 °C for heat stress and shifted to 30 °C for recovery, following which they were gradient-diluted and spotted on SDG plates.;  Skn7Δ has been confirmed as being sensitive to acute heat stress, probably by acting together with yeast heat shock factors [37]. The skn7Δ cells expressing seven CrHsp20s always survived better than those harboring pYES2 (Figure 9), indicating that CrHsp20s, being molecular chaperones, are thought to protect the cell during exposure to lethal heat stress, although their exact function remains unclear.;  The yeast cultures were adjusted to OD600 = 2 firstly, then were incubated at 52 °C for 15 min and moved to 30 °C environment before being spotted on SDG/−U medium (without any chemical stress factors) for thermotolerance confirmation.;  The corresponding yeast spots growing on SDG/−U plates without heat stress were used as the control.; Oxidative stress caused by the increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as H2O2 and superoxide anion, is the consequence of many cellular metabolic processes and biotic/abiotic stresses.;  Hsp20s have significant effects on the response to oxidative stress [38]. Here we also assessed the possible antioxidant abilities of seven CrHsp20s with a yeast spot assay.;  Unexpectedly, the results showed that all seven CrHsp20s failed to relieve H2O2 toxicity even at relatively low H2O2 concentrations, either in skn7∆ (Figure 10A) or in yap1∆ (Figure 10B), which was quite different from other antioxidant genes, such as C. rosea CrMTs [39], or other plant sHsp genes, such as Rosa chinensis RcHSP17.8 [24]. These results indicate that C. rosea CrHsp20s might not be directly involved in scavenging ROS but may diminish severe harm from stress in other ways.; The H2O2 oxidative stress tolerance confirmations in yeast mutant strains. (A) skn7Δ. (B) yap1∆. Yeast cultures were adjusted to OD600 = 2, and 2-μL of serial dilutions (10-fold, from left to right in each panel) were spotted on SDG/−U medium plates supplemented with different concentrations of H2O2 (0.2 mM, 0.3 mM, and 0.5 mM), and the corresponding yeast spots growing on SDG/−U plates without H2O2 were used as the control.; Environmental stress is a crucial factor that greatly limits plant growth and affects the distribution of species.;  Hsp20s, which are the most abundant Hsps found in plants, are small molecular chaperones that play important roles in plant growth and development, as well as being widely involved in abiotic stress tolerance, especially to heat stress [6,40,41]. Hsp20s can inhibit the irreversible aggregation of denaturing proteins and enhance cellular thermotolerance, thereby maintaining basic cellular activities and improving the adversity resistance of plants when challenged by heat or other stresses [6]. The halophyte C. rosea, belonging to the Fabaceae family, is one seashore halophyte plant that possesses multiple stress-resistant features.; The gene structures of the CrHsp20 family also exhibit characteristics associated with being rapid stress-responsive genes.;  It is important to note that the occurrence of introns in a gene and the quickly expressing of a gene are controversial, since fewer or no introns were found to enhance the immediate activation of gene expression in plants [46]. The CrHsp20 genes without or with fewer introns might be a very effective strategy for rapidly responsive gene expression in terms of heat or other abiotic stress challenges.;  Heat stress often occurs quickly, which inevitably leads to the immediate initiation of heat shock and the induction of gene expression [47,48]. Combined with the physicochemical characteristics of CrHsp20 members (Table 1), about 78% of protein members were unstable (II > 40), and the majority of the CrHsp20s were hydrophilic in nature (GRAVY < 0).;  Our results indicate that most of the CrHsp20s could be classified as unstable proteins and that they showed rapid induction in response to stress in the cellular environment.; Hsp20 is a diverse, ancient, and important family present in all organisms [6], and Hsp20 proteins, as molecular chaperones, play important roles in deterring or reducing the irreversible aggregation of denatured proteins in an ATP-independent manner under stress, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating plant growth and development [7]. In plants, Hsp20s act as the first line of defense against any adverse condition that could endanger the cellular proteome and protect cells against abiotic stresses, thereby representing an attractive target for sustainable genetic improvement for agricultural production [44]. For instance, various rice Hsp20 genes are differentially regulated at different developmental stages of rice plants, or are upregulated or downregulated by heat stress or other abiotic and biotic stresses [45]. The gene structure analysis of the CrHsp20 family indicates that the majority of CrHsp20 members possess the characteristics of being immediate stress-response genes because they were intronless or only contained one intron (Figure 2), which means their transcription and subsequent translation might be rapidly activated under stress, as the formation of mature mRNA of CrHsp20s reduces the steps for the elimination of introns, thus shortening the response time.;  Thus, the cis-acting elements in promoter regions play significant roles in gene regulation and expression, and the well-regulated promoters or cis-acting elements are strongly required for the engineering of transgenic plants to achieve the controlled expression level of target genes [33]. Investigation of cis-acting elements of CrHsp20 promoter regions indicates that several stress-responsive elements, such as ABRE (ABA responsive element), HSE (heat shock elements), MYB (Myb-binding element), and MYC (Myc-binding element) (Figure 4), are abundant in the promoter regions of most CrHsp20s, thereby further defining their possible roles as stress-responsive genes.;  Given the intensity of sun light and environmental heat, as well as the complicated high salt/alkaline and water shortage on Yongxing Island (YX), this result further implies that CrHsp20s might act in abiotic stress responses in the native specialized habitat (YX) of C. rosea.;  As Hsp20 genes are major stress biomarkers in plants [7,44], a close relationship must exist between the expression of CrHsp20s and tolerance to multiple stressors.;  In this study, we analyzed the expression patterns of CrHsp20s in C. rosea seedlings in response to various abiotic stresses and found that many differentially expressed CrHsp20s were significantly upregulated in response to these stresses, especially to heat (Figure 6 and Figure 7).;  The expression of most PvHsp20s responds to heat and other abiotic stresses, and the accumulation of PvHsp20s might facilitate the successful adaptation of switchgrass to the hot and dry plateaus of North America [9]. Salix suchowensis is a specialized shrub willow species that presents good resistance to multiple stress conditions.;  The expression of Ssu-Hsp20s was induced by different abiotic stresses, especially heat stress [21]. Ricinus communis is an important industrial crop that exhibits good tolerance to a diverse range of abiotic stresses.;  The RcsHSP family showed differentially regulated expression patterns in response to various abiotic stresses, and the overexpression of some RcsHSP genes in A. thaliana could enhance transgenic seed germination under a variety of abiotic stresses [49]. African bermudagrass (Cynodon transvaalensis) is a perennial warm-season turfgrass species that is primarily endemic to some damp and uncultivated areas in South Africa and other regions.;  The expression patterns of CtHSP20 genes were differentially regulated by multiple abiotic stresses [50]. In our research, the expression patterns of CrHsp20s were investigated in detail in C. rosea seedlings subjected to various multiple environmental factors associated with its native habitat, such as heat, high salinity, alkaline, and drought (water deficit).;  The results from both the RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR assays indicate that, compared with other abiotic stresses, heat stress affects the transcriptional levels of CrHsp20s to the greatest extent without exception (Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8).; The overexpression of different Hsp20s in plants or microorganisms has been demonstrated by multiple studies to elevate stress tolerance [7]. Here we also amplified several CrHsp20s from the total cDNAs of the C. rosea plants and performed heterologous overexpression with a yeast system—a simple and rapid method for the exploration of the putative functions of genes in vivo.;  For instance, the carrot Hsp17.7 gene could increase the growth rates and protein solubility in transgenic yeast under heat, cold, acid, and osmotic stress conditions [51]. Three Camellia sinensis small Hsp genes, CsHSP17.7, CsHSP18.1, and CsHSP21.8, also increased the tolerance of Pichia pastoris to heat and cold through heterologous expression in yeast [52]. Similarly, the overexpression of an Hsp (ThHSP18.3) from Tamarix hispida also conferred salt, alkaline, high osmotic stress, heavy metal, and heat or cold stress tolerance in yeast [53]. These CrHsp20s may act as molecular chaperones to protect yeast against heat stress damage by stabilizing proteins and membranes from degeneration, thereby maintaining regular yeast growth.;  Although some reports indicated that plant Hsp20s may also reduce the toxic effects of abiotic stresses by scavenging cellular ROS indirectly [24,38,47], and RcHSP17.8 in rose could enhance yeast H2O2 tolerance after overexpression, in our study we found that none of these seven CrHsp20s could elevate the H2O2 tolerance in either the skn7Δ or yap1Δ yeast mutant strains (Figure 10).;  This is quite different from other antioxidant molecular chaperones, such as late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) and abscisic acid-, stress-, and ripening-induced (ASR) proteins [54], or metallothioneins (MTs) [39]. Yap1 or Skn7 are two major transcription factors responsive to ROS in yeast, and functional deletion for either of these two regulators in yeast would cause hypersensitivity to H2O2 [55]. Such differences could be partially interpreted by the fact that H2O2 toxicity can be directly relaxed by some reductive protein molecules, such as MTs and LEAs/ASRs, while Hsp20s, being molecular chaperones, are mainly in charge of preventing the target proteins or structures from stress-induced aggregation or denaturation, thereby maintaining or recovering cellular homeostasis.;  On the other hand, although plant Hsp20 involvement was proven in the ROS pathway [47,48], the Hsp20s participate more in the feedback regulation for ROS scavenging, and Hsp protection roles alone cannot cope with excessive ROS production under extreme stress challenges [48]. That is, the ROS scavenging or ROS toxicity- alleviating might be facilitated by accumulating Hsp20 proteins to some extent, while the complete detoxification of ROS has to rely more heavily on the regular-acting cellular antioxidant system, including reductive small molecules (e.g., MTs, LEAs/ASRs) and the antioxidant enzyme system (e.g., superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase).;  Further work is clearly needed to determine how CrHsp20s act in response to cellular oxidative stress caused by extraneous interference, and more related studies on the effects of such abiotic stresses as high salinity/alkaline, drought, or heavy metals are necessary.;  For abiotic stress-related RNA-Seq analysis, the 30-day-old C. rosea seedlings were removed from the pots and carefully cleaned, following which they were transferred into 600 mM NaCl solution (1/2 Hoagland’s) for high-salinity stress.;  For salt–alkaline stress, the cleaned C. rosea seedlings were soaked in a 150 mM NaHCO3 (pH 8.2) solution (1/2 Hoagland’s).;  For high osmotic stress treatment, the seedlings were soaked in a 300 mM mannitol solution (1/2 Hoagland’s).;  For heat stress (HS), the seedlings were soaked in 45 °C pre-warmed 1/2 Hoagland’s solution with their roots submerged and placed in a 45 °C-thermostatic light incubator for 2 h.;  In short, the PCR fragments were inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pYES2 and, after sequencing confirmation, these recombinant expression vectors were transformed into different yeast strains to verify the stress tolerance functions.;  A synthetic defined (SD) yeast medium without uracil (SD-Ura) containing 2% (w/v) galactose (Gal) was used as the yeast induction medium (SDG-Ura) during the heat-stress tolerance and oxidative stress experiments on solid medium for the localization observations.;  The cells were then serially diluted in 10-fold steps, and 2-μL aliquots of each were finally spotted onto SDG medium plates with or without H2O2 for oxidative stress tolerance.;  A total of 41 CrHsp20s were identified and their gene structures, gene duplication models, stress-related cis-acting elements in promoter regions, and expression patterns in different tissues or under specific abiotic stresses were also systematically explored.;  In addition, we discussed the possible roles in which the CrHsp20 family might be involved in multiple stress responses, especially heat stress.;  The systematic characterization of the CrHsp20 family not only provides a meaningful overview of this gene family, but also contributes toward illuminating the heat resistant mechanism of this specialized plant and even the adaptability of C. rosea to other stress conditions."
" abiotic stresses","D000079225 ",35742848,9223760," The expression patterns of the CrHsp20 family were analyzed by RNA sequencing both at the tissue-specific level and under different abiotic stresses, and were further validated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR.;  However, some of the heat-upregulated CrHsp20 genes showed completely different expression patterns in response to salt, alkaline, or high osmotic stresses, which indicates their potential specific function in mediating the response of C. rosea to abiotic stresses.;  Our results also contribute to the understanding of the complexity of the response of CrHsp20 genes to other abiotic stresses and may help in future studies evaluating the functional characteristics of CrHsp20s for crop genetic improvement.;  Interestingly, the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) revealed by whole genome and transcriptome sequencing in some special-habitat plants have inspired significant research interest in recent years, mainly concerning the adaptation mechanisms regarding extreme adversity [18]. Recent achievements in ‘omics’ technologies are greatly facilitating the assessment of gene families in the regulatory adaptations underlying stress tolerance in plants [19]. Hsp20 families are essential components of plant tolerance under various abiotic stresses, and the Hsp20 gene family has been identified in some specialized-habitat plants, including switchgrass [20], willow [21], sorghum [22], and Sorbus pohuashanensis [23]. In addition, the functions of some specific plant Hsp20s have been further assessed using transgenic methods.;  For example, a cytosolic class I small Hsp from Rosa chinensis, RcHSP17.8, could enhance the thermotolerance and resistance to salt, drought, and osmotic stresses of transgenic microorganisms and Arabidopsis [24]. Overexpression of a wheat TaHSP23.9 in Arabidopsis showed improved heat and salt tolerance in the transgenic lines [25]. The heat-induced and chloroplast-localized sHsp gene from creeping bent grass, AsHSP26.8a, displayed slightly improved tolerance to drought, but demonstrated reduced tolerance to heat and salinity stresses when overexpressed in bent grass and Arabidopsis plants [26,27]. Overexpression of a pepper CaHSP16.4 gene enhanced tolerance to heat stress in Arabidopsis [28]. These studies have clearly demonstrated that Hsp20 genes are involved in regulating a diversity of responses to abiotic stresses, especially heat stress.;  The results of this study provide baseline information for the role of an important gene family in the adaptation of a leguminous species to heat, high salt/alkaline, and drought stress, and also offers a reference for gene evolution and function in response to abiotic stresses.;  The hormone response elements included gibberellic acid (GA) response, methyl jasmonate (MeJA) response, salicylic acid (SA) response, abscisic acid (ABA) response (ABRE), and ethylene response (ERE); the stress response elements included low-temperature responsive (LTR), elicitor responsive (AT-rich sequence), defense and stress responsive (TC-rich sequence), and pathogen-inducible (as-1); the transcript factor (TF) binding sites included MYB (flavonoid biosynthesis binding site, light binding site, and drought inducible), MYC (dehydration or other abiotic stresses responsive), and Hsf-binding heat shock elements (HSEs).;  To analyze the CrHsp20s involved in the response of C. rosea to these abiotic stresses, we analyzed the RNA-Seq data to assess the expression levels of the 41 CrHsp20s in the roots and leaves during the response to salinity, alkalinity, high osmotic stress, and heat (Figure 6).;  Our qRT-PCR results also demonstrated that almost all these CrHsp20s (except CrHsp20-14) showed strikingly apparent expression induction in all three detected tissues (root, stem, and leaf), and their induction degree seemed to be the largest among these abiotic stresses (Figure 8G).; Hsp20 is a diverse, ancient, and important family present in all organisms [6], and Hsp20 proteins, as molecular chaperones, play important roles in deterring or reducing the irreversible aggregation of denatured proteins in an ATP-independent manner under stress, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating plant growth and development [7].

These studies have clearly demonstrated that Hsp20 genes are involved in regulating a diversity of responses to abiotic stresses, especially heat stress.;  In the leaves, the expression of the CrHsp20 family was almost not affected by these three challenges at 2 h, but with the increase in stress duration, these three stresses all caused upregulated expression patterns in some CrHsp20 members at 48 h, and the alkaline and high osmotic stresses seemed to have more influence than high salinity (Figure 6C,D).;  The qRT-PCR results show that compared with the salt, alkaline, and high osmotic stresses (dozens to hundreds of times), all 14 transcripts accumulated greatly after the heat stress process (hundreds to thousands, even till to tens of thousands of times) (Figure 8)."

" SRCD","D011832",27351338,4924860," The SRCD data of PmEst is in agreement with the prediction of an α/β protein, which leads us to assume that it displays a typical fold of esterases from this family.; The SRCD spectra of PmEst (46 μM) in aqueous solution were obtained over the wavelength range of 270–170 nm with 1 nm intervals and 2s dwell time, collecting 3 individual scans at 25°C, using a 0.00507 cm pathlength quartz cuvette (Hellma Scientific).;  The SRCD spectrum of the dehydrated film was collected over the range from 270 to 155 nm, with 1 nm interval and 2s dwell time, at 25°C, taking measurements at four different rotations on the plate (0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees) and 2 scans on each position.; All SRCD data of PmEst were processed using CDTool software [22], which was employed to calculate the average of the individual scans, the subtraction of the corresponding baseline spectra, zeroing, smoothing with a Savitzky-Golay filter, calibration with camphorsulfonic acid, and scaling the final spectra in delta epsilon units, using a mean residue weight of 114.;  Estimations of the structural content of PmEst based on the SRCD spectra were performed using the Dichroweb server [23] with the SP175 database [24], using the goodness-of-fit test [25] and the Continll [26] algorithm.;  SRCD and fluorescence spectra were collected at each temperature using the same parameters described before, using 3 repeats scans at each temperature.;  For the SRCD experiments, principal component analyses used CDTools software.; Synchrotron radiation circular dichroism analyses on PmEst in aqueous solution confirm the protein contains both helical and strands elements (Fig 3), due to the presence of the two minima at the region of 222 and 208 nm, and the positive maximum at 196 nm that are characteristic spectral bands for α-helices [38–39], and the additional minimum at the vacuum-UV region at 175 nm, which is a band seen in proteins containing β-sheets [40–41]. Moreover, the structural content of PmEst predicted by bioinformatics analyses, and in the 3-D model are in close agreement with the calculated secondary structure of the protein based on its SRCD spectrum in aqueous solution (Table A in S1 Table).; The native SRCD spectrum of PmEst was not altered when the enzyme was incubated at acid conditions.;  The native SRCD spectrum of PmEst started to present slight changes ~35°C.;  Fig 4a shows the 3-D plot for the SRCD spectra of the thermal melting of PmEst at pH 7.0.;  At high temperatures (~85°C) the SRCD spectrum of PmEst was not typical of a fully unordered/denatured protein.; a) Synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectra as a function of temperature overlaid in the Z direction; b) emission spectra of PmEst as a function of temperature in sodium phosphate pH 7.4. c) fluorescence emission maxima data as a function of temperature. d) thermal denaturation curves of PmEst, taken from SRCD data at 196, 208, and 222 nm, and e) Phase delay (bottom curves) and modulation ratio (top curves) of the excited state lifetime of PmEst in PBS as a function of temperature, from 15°C (solid) to 45°C (dot) in10°C steps; and f) their respective phasor diagram, showing the point at 55°C is not on the same trajectory of the other point at below temperatures.; In agreement with the SRCD data, the redshift in the fluorescence emission maximum of PmEst and a reduction of the fluorescence intensity also occurred as the temperature increased (Fig 4c).;  The Tm obtained by SRCD analysis was also confirmed with fluorescence thermal assays (Fig 4d).;  In agreement with the activity assays, the SRCD spectra of PmEst showed virtually no changes in the presence of 10 and 20% of organic solvents (Fig A in S4 File).; A) Secondary structure content of PmEst estimated by SRCD and bioinformatics analyses.; The authors are grateful for the support of paired UK-Brazil partnering grants from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) (grant J019747 to BAW) and Brazil National Council of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq) to APUA, grants 553056/2011-5 and 407337/2013-0; BBSRC grant J019135/1 (to BAW), BBSRC-Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) grant FAPPA 15/50347-2 and BBSRC N012763 (to APUA and BAW, respectively), and CNPq for postdoctoral fellowships (to JLSL and JSY, grants 150304/2015-3 and 553056/2011-5, respectively); Petrobras (grant 2012/00187-0) to NRSB providing a DTI fellowship (to JMM) and agreeing with the decision to publish; and SRCD beamtime grants from the ISA Synchrotron (Aarhus, Denmark) (to JLSL and BAW), and the Soleil Synchrotron (France) (to BAW)."
"osteoporosis","D010024",30400922,6220464," Thus, the present study was aimed to examine the synergistic anti-osteoporotic potential of mixtures containing different proportions of EAP and TM compared with that of the single formulations of each herbal extract using bilateral ovariectomized (OVX) mice, a renowned rodent model for studying human osteoporosis.; The results of this study suggest that, the EAP:TM (3:1) combination might act as a new pharmaceutical agent and/or health functional food substance for curing osteoporosis in menopausal women.;  Although it is partially preventable, fractures related to osteoporosis are still common [1]. Osteoporosis, a metabolic bone disorder, causes an imbalance between the bone [2]. Thus, osteoporosis constitutes a major public health issue due to its association with age-related fractures, particularly of the hip, vertebrae, distal forearm, and humerus [3, 4]. During the past decade, numerous studies have been reported on the effects of new substances for the prevention and/or treatment of bone disorders [5, 6]. However, there is a need to develop an efficient resorptive inhibitor with higher safety.; Osteoclast-mediated bone resorption is inhibited by binding of risedronate sodium (RES) to bone hydroxyapatites [10]. RES, a pridinyl bisphosphonate, inhibits bone resorption by changing osteoclast cytoskeleton protein [11], and induces osteoclast apoptosis [12]. RES has been previously used for the curing osteoporosis in menopausal women [13]. Topical treatments with RES (at a concentration of 0.02% and 2.5 mg/kg/day) in OVX rat and/or mice have shown sustained bone biomechanical and microstructural features [14, 15]. Hence, after OVX, oral administration of risedronate sodium (2.5 mg/kg per day) was employed as a positive-control.; Textoria morbifera (TM) Nakai mainly grows in Jeju-do Island and along the Korean southwestern coastline [16, 17]. It has been used as an ingredient for traditional medicine and tea for immunological enhancement [16–18]. Previously, TM extracts have exhibited numerous immunological activities, including anti-diabetic [19], antioxidant [20], anti-cancer [21], anti-insecticidal [22], anti-complementary effects, as well as antibiotic and medicinal effects for liver diseases [23]. Recently, TM extracts have been reported for anti-osteoclastogenic and osteoporosis ameliorating effects [24–26]. β-selinene, a sesquiterpene derivative and capnellane-8-one have been reported as the most abundant active ingredients of TM [27].; In this study, we aimed to investigate the optimal compositions of EAP:TM mixtures that are associated with clear synergistic anti-osteoporotic potential compared with the single formulations, using bilateral OVX female mice, a renowned rodent model for studying human osteoporosis [7, 9].;  In this experiment, 150 mice were allocated as OVX-operated osteoporosis model and 10 mice were allocated as sham-operated control.; Estrogen deficiency during menopause is one of the major causes of osteoporosis in menopausal women [54]. A disturbance in bone formation and resorption results in fractures and bone loss, ultimately causing osteoporosis [2]. Antiresorptive agents are well known compared to the bone formation stimulant anabolic agents [6]. In depth understanding of bone formation and osteoblast differentiation has helped in the design of trials to develop anabolic agents [7].;  During this experiment, we used bilateral OVX mice, a renowned rodent model for studying human osteoporosis [7–9], to observe the synergistic anti-osteoporotic potential of mixtures containing different proportions of EAP and TM compared with that of the single formulation of each herbal extract.;  In addition, decreases in all histomorphometric indices indicated reduction in bone mass and structure, and increases in resorption indices in the femur of OVX controls suggested increases in bone turnover and decreases in bone formation, which are associated with estrogen-deficient osteoporosis.; The results of the present study were comparable to those of RES (2.5 mg/kg) treatment in this experiment, which suggest that the EAP:TM formulation 3:1 might act as a potent new agent for curing osteoporosis in menopausal women.; Bone mineral content significantly decrease as osteoporosis progresses [7, 9]. Specifically, IP and Ca decrease most dramatically; however, Ca/IP ratios do not change because of the simultaneous reduction in both IP and Ca concentration [7, 9, 63, 64]. In the current analysis, significant decreases in femur Ca and IP concentrations were observed in OVX control.; BMD, a well-acknowledged indicator of fluctuations in bone quality under clinical settings, decreases in osteoporosis, irrespective of the cause [7, 9, 65, 66]. BMD has provided useful predictive information on the efficacy of anti-osteoporotic agents [66], and bone quality diagnostic profiles for clinical research [65]. BMD and bone strength significantly reduces in osteoporosis irrespective of the causes [7, 9, 65, 66]. In this study, a significant decrease in femur mean BMD and total body was noticed in OVX control groups.;  In particular, compared with the single formulations, the EAP:TM (3:1) mixture revealed significantly favorable inhibition of estrogen-deficient osteoporosis indices.;  Hence, EAP:TM 3:1 mixture might act as a potent new agent for curing osteoporosis in menopausal women.; All laboratory animals were treated according to the national regulations for the usage and welfare of laboratory animals, and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Daegu Haany University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk-do, Republic of Korea, prior to animal experiments [Approval No: DHU2016–072; Approved on: August 23, 2016]. In addition, experiments on osteoporosis were conducted based on the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidelines for Preclinical Evaluation of Agents Used in The Prevention or Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis [April 1994, Division of Metabolic and Endocrine Drug Products, USA]."
