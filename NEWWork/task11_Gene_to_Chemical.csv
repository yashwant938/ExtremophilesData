27276261,"This work explores the proton/hydroxide permeability (PH+/OH−) of membranes that were made of synthetic extremophile-inspired phospholipids with systematically varied structural elements.;  A fluorescence-based permeability assay was optimized to determine the effects on the PH+/OH− through liposome membranes with variations in the following lipid attributes: transmembrane tethering, tether length, and the presence of isoprenoid methyl groups on one or both lipid tails.;  All permeability assays were performed in the presence of a low concentration of valinomycin (10 nM) to prevent buildup of a membrane potential without artificially increasing the measured PH+/OH−. Surprisingly, the presence of a transmembrane tether did not impact PH+/OH− at room temperature.;  Among tethered lipid monolayers, PH+/OH− increased with increasing tether length if the number of carbons in the untethered acyl tail was constant.;  Untethered lipids with two isoprenoid methyl tails led to lower PH+/OH− values than lipids with only one or no isoprenoid tails.;  Whatever the mechanism, the permeation of protons or hydroxide ions is conventionally described by a permeability coefficient, PH+/OH−, in units of cm s−1, defined by Fick’s law (Eq. 1):; where J (mol m−2 s−1) is the inward flux of solute across the membrane, PH+/OH− (m s−1) is the permeability of the membrane, and ΔC (mol m−3) is the concentration gradient across the membrane.; Widely varying values of PH+/OH− have been observed both between and within laboratories.;  Reported PH+/OH− values for membranes composed of the lipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), for example, include values on the order of 10−1 cm s−1 (21), 10−2 cm s−1 (22), 10−5 cm s−1 (23), and 10−7 cm s−1 (24, 25); these disparate values were all similarly obtained by subjecting liposomes to a stepwise ΔpH and observing proton flux over time.;  Recommendations such as this are sensible; there is a clear need for a standard, well-defined assay for permeation of H+/OH− across membranes so that PH+/OH− values obtained by different groups can be compared.;  However, Kuyper et al. analyzed H+/OH− permeation across hundreds of single vesicles in parallel and observed a high degree of variation in PH+/OH− between liposomes in the same experiment without observing correlation with liposome size or any other observable parameter, indicating that broad distributions of PH+/OH− values may be unavoidable (24).; In an attempt to obtain consistent readings of this notoriously fickle parameter, we have optimized an established liposome-based assay for PH+/OH− developed by Paula et al. that tracks the fluorescence decay of an encapsulated pH-sensitive dye in response to a step change in the external pH (19).; To make this study possible, we synthesized a series of extremophile-inspired lipids composed of two glycerophosphocholine heads connected by a membrane-spanning n-alkyl tether with each head ether-bonded to a phytanyl chain (T28, T32, and T36 (Fig. 1, A–C)), as well as several untethered lipids (U16, 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Di-O-PhyPC), 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DiPhyPC), and POPC (Fig. 1, D–G)) to seek answers to our questions about structure-permeability relationships of liposomes from pure lipid preparations at room temperature: First, how does the presence of a single tether between two lipid headgroups affect PH+/OH− compared to the absence of a tether? Second, how does the length of the tether affect H+/OH− permeability when the lengths of the untethered phytanyl chains are kept constant at 16 carbons? And third, how does the PH+/OH− of an untethered lipid with a repeating isoprenoid methyl motif on one of its tails compare to that of a lipid with the methyl groups on both tails?; where [H+]f,o is the exterior proton concentration during the main decay phase, obtained from the pH measured after nigericin is added; A1 (mol m−3), A2 (unitless), x1 (mol m−3), x2 (mol m−3), y1 (mol m−3), and y2 (unitless) are the empirical fitting parameters from the calibration fits (Fig. 2, B and C, explained in Calculation); C (mol m−3) is a constant of integration; PH+/OH− (m s−1) is the H+/OH− permeability; r (m) is the most probable liposome radius as determined by DLS; and t (s) is time.;  The parameters C and PH+/OH− are allowed to vary during fitting.;  The permeability values we obtained for membranes from POPC and DiPhyPC lipids (Table 1) are in reasonable agreement with some literature values reported for POPC, PH+/OH− = 7 × 10−5 cm/s (23), and for DiPhyPC, PH+/OH− = 4.0 × 10−6 cm/s (40) and 7.0 × 10−6 cm/s (41).; Except in the case of bending rigidity and PH+/OH− (last two columns), values are expressed as the mean ± SE.;  Our goal was to find a range in which liposomes would exhibit PH+/OH− values higher than in the absence of valinomycin, indicating that the buildup of a membrane potential accompanying H+ diffusion was being successfully prevented via K+ diffusion, but in which PH+/OH− was independent of the valinomycin concentration, since a positive dependence would indicate protonophoric activity.;  As valinomycin is poorly soluble in water, we added it to liposome solutions via concentrated aliquots in DMSO; the resulting plot of PH+/OH− versus valinomycin concentration is shown in Fig. 3.;  We chose DMSO as a solvent rather than ethanol (used in Paula et al. (19)), because DMSO has a smaller effect on PH+/OH− (Fig. 3, leftmost data points).;  The H+/OH− permeability increased from the baseline value after the addition of just 10 fM valinomycin and plateaued with increasing valinomycin concentrations until a point of inflection was reached around 100 nM, at which point PH+/OH− began to increase dramatically in the presence of more valinomycin.; Valinomycin concentrations up to 10−7 M prevent membrane potential buildup without causing an increase in PH+/OH−.

(B) Correlation plot of log PH+/OH− as a function of the number of times a water cluster appeared in the hydrophobic region of the lipid membrane over the course of a 50 ns MD simulation.;  To observe the effects of tethering, we compared PH+/OH− values from membranes composed of U16 and T32, since T32’s structure is identical to two U16 lipids bonded together at the terminal carbons of their unbranched chains (Fig. 1, B and D).;  A two-tailed Student’s t-test comparing the log-transformed permeability values of T32 and U16 vesicles (Table 1) showed that they were not significantly different (p = 0.46); the spread of the U16 PH+/OH− values fell entirely within the spread of the T32 PH+/OH− values.;  Komatsu and Chong found that the H+/OH− permeability of doubly tethered lipids isolated from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius was relatively invariant with respect to temperature from 25 to 80°C, whereas PH+/OH− values from standard (untethered) eggPC lipids increased dramatically with increasing temperature.;  The PH+/OH− values from the two membrane compositions were comparable at room temperature but diverged greatly at higher temperatures (63).; Based on a two-tailed Student’s t-test comparing log-transformed PH+/OH− values, the mean permeability of liposomes from Di-O-PhyPC lipids was lower (p = 0.059) than that from U16 lipids (Table 1).;  This variability, seen both in this work and in the literature (8, 16, 21, 25, 37, 41, 64, 65), represents a limitation of the usefulness of PH+/OH− data (24, 26).;  We have attempted to identify and minimize potential sources of variation inherent in the process of gathering PH+/OH− values, and we present a detailed discussion on this topic in Section S2 of the Supporting Material.;  The lipid T32, which was tethered by a straight 32-carbon chain, produced membranes with PH+/OH− values similar to those of membranes composed of its untethered equivalent, U16, revealing that tethering does not affect PH+/OH− at room temperature.;  However, PH+/OH− values among tethered lipid membranes increased with increasing tether length if the number of carbons in the untethered acyl tail was constant.",,up

Surprisingly, the presence of a transmembrane tether did not impact PH+/OH− at room temperature.;  Among tethered lipid monolayers, PH+/OH− increased with increasing tether length if the number of carbons in the untethered acyl tail was constant.;  Untethered lipids with two isoprenoid methyl tails led to lower PH+/OH− values than lipids with only one or no isoprenoid tails.;  Whatever the mechanism, the permeation of protons or hydroxide ions is conventionally described by a permeability coefficient, PH+/OH−, in units of cm s−1, defined by Fick’s law (Eq. 1):; where J (mol m−2 s−1) is the inward flux of solute across the membrane, PH+/OH− (m s−1) is the permeability of the membrane, and ΔC (mol m−3) is the concentration gradient across the membrane.; Widely varying values of PH+/OH− have been observed both between and within laboratories.;  Reported PH+/OH− values for membranes composed of the lipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), for example, include values on the order of 10−1 cm s−1 (21), 10−2 cm s−1 (22), 10−5 cm s−1 (23), and 10−7 cm s−1 (24, 25); these disparate values were all similarly obtained by subjecting liposomes to a stepwise ΔpH and observing proton flux over time.;  Recommendations such as this are sensible; there is a clear need for a standard, well-defined assay for permeation of H+/OH− across membranes so that PH+/OH− values obtained by different groups can be compared.;  However, Kuyper et al. analyzed H+/OH− permeation across hundreds of single vesicles in parallel and observed a high degree of variation in PH+/OH− between liposomes in the same experiment without observing correlation with liposome size or any other observable parameter, indicating that broad distributions of PH+/OH− values may be unavoidable (24).; In an attempt to obtain consistent readings of this notoriously fickle parameter, we have optimized an established liposome-based assay for PH+/OH− developed by Paula et al. that tracks the fluorescence decay of an encapsulated pH-sensitive dye in response to a step change in the external pH (19).; To make this study possible, we synthesized a series of extremophile-inspired lipids composed of two glycerophosphocholine heads connected by a membrane-spanning n-alkyl tether with each head ether-bonded to a phytanyl chain (T28, T32, and T36 (Fig. 1, A–C)), as well as several untethered lipids (U16, 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Di-O-PhyPC), 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DiPhyPC), and POPC (Fig. 1, D–G)) to seek answers to our questions about structure-permeability relationships of liposomes from pure lipid preparations at room temperature: First, how does the presence of a single tether between two lipid headgroups affect PH+/OH− compared to the absence of a tether? Second, how does the length of the tether affect H+/OH− permeability when the lengths of the untethered phytanyl chains are kept constant at 16 carbons? And third, how does the PH+/OH− of an untethered lipid with a repeating isoprenoid methyl motif on one of its tails compare to that of a lipid with the methyl groups on both tails?; where [H+]f,o is the exterior proton concentration during the main decay phase, obtained from the pH measured after nigericin is added; A1 (mol m−3), A2 (unitless), x1 (mol m−3), x2 (mol m−3), y1 (mol m−3), and y2 (unitless) are the empirical fitting parameters from the calibration fits (Fig. 2, B and C, explained in Calculation); C (mol m−3) is a constant of integration; PH+/OH− (m s−1) is the H+/OH− permeability; r (m) is the most probable liposome radius as determined by DLS; and t (s) is time.;  The parameters C and PH+/OH− are allowed to vary during fitting.;  The permeability values we obtained for membranes from POPC and DiPhyPC lipids (Table 1) are in reasonable agreement with some literature values reported for POPC, PH+/OH− = 7 × 10−5 cm/s (23), and for DiPhyPC, PH+/OH− = 4.0 × 10−6 cm/s (40) and 7.0 × 10−6 cm/s (41).; Except in the case of bending rigidity and PH+/OH− (last two columns), values are expressed as the mean ± SE.;  Our goal was to find a range in which liposomes would exhibit PH+/OH− values higher than in the absence of valinomycin, indicating that the buildup of a membrane potential accompanying H+ diffusion was being successfully prevented via K+ diffusion, but in which PH+/OH− was independent of the valinomycin concentration, since a positive dependence would indicate protonophoric activity.;  As valinomycin is poorly soluble in water, we added it to liposome solutions via concentrated aliquots in DMSO; the resulting plot of PH+/OH− versus valinomycin concentration is shown in Fig. 3.;  We chose DMSO as a solvent rather than ethanol (used in Paula et al.

Before the axis break, points represent PH+/OH− after the addition of the solvent vehicle only as indicated by the symbols: red squares, 2.66 μL DMSO; brown circle, 1.33 μL ethanol; orange diamond, 2.66 μL ethanol; pink triangles, no solvent.; We explored the effect of transmembrane tethering, tether length, and the presence of isoprenoid methyl groups on one or both lipid tails on the PH+/OH− values through liposomes formed from a series of synthetic lipids with small systematic structural variations.; Box-and-whisker plots showing PH+/OH− values gathered from seven different lipids.; The PH+/OH− permeability results from the lipids T28, T32, and T36 indicate that liposome membranes become more permeable to protons as tether length increases if the length of the untethered acyl chain is kept constant (Table 1).;  A Tukey honest significant difference test comparing the log-transformed PH+/OH− values of these three lipids found the mean H+/OH− permeability of liposomes composed of T28 lipids to be significantly smaller (p = 0.01) than that of T36 liposomes.;  As in prior research studies (19), we used log-transformed values for all statistical comparisons, because the populations of measured PH+/OH− values failed tests of homogeneity of variance (Levene’s, p = 0.002; Brown-Forsythe, p = 0.02) unless the values were log-transformed (Levene’s, p = 0.72; Brown-Forsythe, p = 0.75).;  In the tethered lipids, the two untethered phytanyl chains have a combined length of 32 methylene groups—four carbons longer than the T28 tether and four carbons shorter than the T36 tether; the differences in PH+/OH− may be attributable to increased hydrocarbon crowding in T28 and the presence of a “gap” in T36.;  Quantifying the entry of water molecules into the hydrophobic core in all six simulated membranes (including three untethered lipids, Table 2) revealed that log PH+/OH− correlated with the total number of water molecules that spontaneously entered the membrane over 50 ns (Pearson coefficient, r = 0.86; p = 0.027).;  A better correlation was found between log PH+/OH− and the number of observations with at least three water molecules residing anywhere in the hydrophobic core of the membrane (Pearson coefficient, r = 0.99; p = 0.0003; Fig. 5

(B) Correlation plot of log PH+/OH− as a function of the number of times a water cluster appeared in the hydrophobic region of the lipid membrane over the course of a 50 ns MD simulation.;  To observe the effects of tethering, we compared PH+/OH− values from membranes composed of U16 and T32, since T32’s structure is identical to two U16 lipids bonded together at the terminal carbons of their unbranched chains (Fig. 1, B and D).;  A two-tailed Student’s t-test comparing the log-transformed permeability values of T32 and U16 vesicles (Table 1) showed that they were not significantly different (p = 0.46); the spread of the U16 PH+/OH− values fell entirely within the spread of the T32 PH+/OH− values.;  Komatsu and Chong found that the H+/OH− permeability of doubly tethered lipids isolated from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius was relatively invariant with respect to temperature from 25 to 80°C, whereas PH+/OH− values from standard (untethered) eggPC lipids increased dramatically with increasing temperature.;  The PH+/OH− values from the two membrane compositions were comparable at room temperature but diverged greatly at higher temperatures (63).; Based on a two-tailed Student’s t-test comparing log-transformed PH+/OH− values, the mean permeability of liposomes from Di-O-PhyPC lipids was lower (p = 0.059) than that from U16 lipids (Table 1).;  This variability, seen both in this work and in the literature (8, 16, 21, 25, 37, 41, 64, 65), represents a limitation of the usefulness of PH+/OH− data (24, 26).;  We have attempted to identify and minimize potential sources of variation inherent in the process of gathering PH+/OH− values, and we present a detailed discussion on this topic in Section S2 of the Supporting Material.;  The lipid T32, which was tethered by a straight 32-carbon chain, produced membranes with PH+/OH− values similar to those of membranes composed of its untethered equivalent, U16, revealing that tethering does not affect PH+/OH− at room temperature.;  However, PH+/OH− values among tethered lipid membranes increased with increasing tether length if the number of carbons in the untethered acyl tail was constant.",,up

Surprisingly, the presence of a transmembrane tether did not impact PH+/OH− at room temperature.;  Among tethered lipid monolayers, PH+/OH− increased with increasing tether length if the number of carbons in the untethered acyl tail was constant.;  Untethered lipids with two isoprenoid methyl tails led to lower PH+/OH− values than lipids with only one or no isoprenoid tails.;  Whatever the mechanism, the permeation of protons or hydroxide ions is conventionally described by a permeability coefficient, PH+/OH−, in units of cm s−1, defined by Fick’s law (Eq. 1):; where J (mol m−2 s−1) is the inward flux of solute across the membrane, PH+/OH− (m s−1) is the permeability of the membrane, and ΔC (mol m−3) is the concentration gradient across the membrane.; Widely varying values of PH+/OH− have been observed both between and within laboratories.;  Reported PH+/OH− values for membranes composed of the lipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), for example, include values on the order of 10−1 cm s−1 (21), 10−2 cm s−1 (22), 10−5 cm s−1 (23), and 10−7 cm s−1 (24, 25); these disparate values were all similarly obtained by subjecting liposomes to a stepwise ΔpH and observing proton flux over time.;  Recommendations such as this are sensible; there is a clear need for a standard, well-defined assay for permeation of H+/OH− across membranes so that PH+/OH− values obtained by different groups can be compared.;  However, Kuyper et al. analyzed H+/OH− permeation across hundreds of single vesicles in parallel and observed a high degree of variation in PH+/OH− between liposomes in the same experiment without observing correlation with liposome size or any other observable parameter, indicating that broad distributions of PH+/OH− values may be unavoidable (24).; In an attempt to obtain consistent readings of this notoriously fickle parameter, we have optimized an established liposome-based assay for PH+/OH− developed by Paula et al. that tracks the fluorescence decay of an encapsulated pH-sensitive dye in response to a step change in the external pH (19).; To make this study possible, we synthesized a series of extremophile-inspired lipids composed of two glycerophosphocholine heads connected by a membrane-spanning n-alkyl tether with each head ether-bonded to a phytanyl chain (T28, T32, and T36 (Fig. 1, A–C)), as well as several untethered lipids (U16, 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Di-O-PhyPC), 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DiPhyPC), and POPC (Fig. 1, D–G)) to seek answers to our questions about structure-permeability relationships of liposomes from pure lipid preparations at room temperature: First, how does the presence of a single tether between two lipid headgroups affect PH+/OH− compared to the absence of a tether? Second, how does the length of the tether affect H+/OH− permeability when the lengths of the untethered phytanyl chains are kept constant at 16 carbons?

Surprisingly, the presence of a transmembrane tether did not impact PH+/OH− at room temperature.;  Among tethered lipid monolayers, PH+/OH− increased with increasing tether length if the number of carbons in the untethered acyl tail was constant.;  Untethered lipids with two isoprenoid methyl tails led to lower PH+/OH− values than lipids with only one or no isoprenoid tails.;  Whatever the mechanism, the permeation of protons or hydroxide ions is conventionally described by a permeability coefficient, PH+/OH−, in units of cm s−1, defined by Fick’s law (Eq. 1):; where J (mol m−2 s−1) is the inward flux of solute across the membrane, PH+/OH− (m s−1) is the permeability of the membrane, and ΔC (mol m−3) is the concentration gradient across the membrane.; Widely varying values of PH+/OH− have been observed both between and within laboratories.;  Reported PH+/OH− values for membranes composed of the lipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), for example, include values on the order of 10−1 cm s−1 (21), 10−2 cm s−1 (22), 10−5 cm s−1 (23), and 10−7 cm s−1 (24, 25); these disparate values were all similarly obtained by subjecting liposomes to a stepwise ΔpH and observing proton flux over time.;  Recommendations such as this are sensible; there is a clear need for a standard, well-defined assay for permeation of H+/OH− across membranes so that PH+/OH− values obtained by different groups can be compared.;  However, Kuyper et al. analyzed H+/OH− permeation across hundreds of single vesicles in parallel and observed a high degree of variation in PH+/OH− between liposomes in the same experiment without observing correlation with liposome size or any other observable parameter, indicating that broad distributions of PH+/OH− values may be unavoidable (24).; In an attempt to obtain consistent readings of this notoriously fickle parameter, we have optimized an established liposome-based assay for PH+/OH− developed by Paula et al. that tracks the fluorescence decay of an encapsulated pH-sensitive dye in response to a step change in the external pH (19).; To make this study possible, we synthesized a series of extremophile-inspired lipids composed of two glycerophosphocholine heads connected by a membrane-spanning n-alkyl tether with each head ether-bonded to a phytanyl chain (T28, T32, and T36 (Fig. 1, A–C)), as well as several untethered lipids (U16, 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Di-O-PhyPC), 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DiPhyPC), and POPC (Fig. 1, D–G)) to seek answers to our questions about structure-permeability relationships of liposomes from pure lipid preparations at room temperature: First, how does the presence of a single tether between two lipid headgroups affect PH+/OH− compared to the absence of a tether? Second, how does the length of the tether affect H+/OH− permeability when the lengths of the untethered phytanyl chains are kept constant at 16 carbons? And third, how does the PH+/OH− of an untethered lipid with a repeating isoprenoid methyl motif on one of its tails compare to that of a lipid with the methyl groups on both tails?; where [H+]f,o is the exterior proton concentration during the main decay phase, obtained from the pH measured after nigericin is added; A1 (mol m−3), A2 (unitless), x1 (mol m−3), x2 (mol m−3), y1 (mol m−3), and y2 (unitless) are the empirical fitting parameters from the calibration fits (Fig. 2, B and C, explained in Calculation); C (mol m−3) is a constant of integration; PH+/OH− (m s−1) is the H+/OH− permeability; r (m) is the most probable liposome radius as determined by DLS; and t (s) is time.;  The parameters C and PH+/OH− are allowed to vary during fitting.;  The permeability values we obtained for membranes from POPC and DiPhyPC lipids (Table 1) are in reasonable agreement with some literature values reported for POPC, PH+/OH− = 7 × 10−5 cm/s (23), and for DiPhyPC, PH+/OH− = 4.0 × 10−6 cm/s (40) and 7.0 × 10−6 cm/s (41).; Except in the case of bending rigidity and PH+/OH− (last two columns), values are expressed as the mean ± SE.;  Our goal was to find a range in which liposomes would exhibit PH+/OH− values higher than in the absence of valinomycin, indicating that the buildup of a membrane potential accompanying H+ diffusion was being successfully prevented via K+ diffusion, but in which PH+/OH− was independent of the valinomycin concentration, since a positive dependence would indicate protonophoric activity.;  As valinomycin is poorly soluble in water, we added it to liposome solutions via concentrated aliquots in DMSO; the resulting plot of PH+/OH− versus valinomycin concentration is shown in Fig. 3.;  We chose DMSO as a solvent rather than ethanol (used in Paula et al. (19)), because DMSO has a smaller effect on PH+/OH− (Fig. 3, leftmost data points).;  The H+/OH− permeability increased from the baseline value after the addition of just 10 fM valinomycin and plateaued with increasing valinomycin concentrations until a point of inflection was reached around 100 nM, at which point PH+/OH− began to increase dramatically in the presence of more valinomycin.; Valinomycin concentrations up to 10−7 M prevent membrane potential buildup without causing an increase in PH+/OH−. Before the axis break, points represent PH+/OH− after the addition of the solvent vehicle only as indicated by the symbols: red squares, 2.66 μL DMSO; brown circle, 1.33 μL ethanol; orange diamond, 2.66 μL ethanol; pink triangles, no solvent.; We explored the effect of transmembrane tethering, tether length, and the presence of isoprenoid methyl groups on one or both lipid tails on the PH+/OH− values through liposomes formed from a series of synthetic lipids with small systematic structural variations.; Box-and-whisker plots showing PH+/OH− values gathered from seven different lipids.; The PH+/OH− permeability results from the lipids T28, T32, and T36 indicate that liposome membranes become more permeable to protons as tether length increases if the length of the untethered acyl chain is kept constant (Table 1).;  A Tukey honest significant difference test comparing the log-transformed PH+/OH− values of these three lipids found the mean H+/OH− permeability of liposomes composed of T28 lipids to be significantly smaller (p = 0.01) than that of T36 liposomes.;  As in prior research studies (19), we used log-transformed values for all statistical comparisons, because the populations of measured PH+/OH− values failed tests of homogeneity of variance (Levene’s, p = 0.002; Brown-Forsythe, p = 0.02) unless the values were log-transformed (Levene’s, p = 0.72; Brown-Forsythe, p = 0.75).;  In the tethered lipids, the two untethered phytanyl chains have a combined length of 32 methylene groups—four carbons longer than the T28 tether and four carbons shorter than the T36 tether; the differences in PH+/OH− may be attributable to increased hydrocarbon crowding in T28 and the presence of a “gap” in T36.;  Quantifying the entry of water molecules into the hydrophobic core in all six simulated membranes (including three untethered lipids, Table 2) revealed that log PH+/OH− correlated with the total number of water molecules that spontaneously entered the membrane over 50 ns (Pearson coefficient, r = 0.86; p = 0.027).;  A better correlation was found between log PH+/OH− and the number of observations with at least three water molecules residing anywhere in the hydrophobic core of the membrane (Pearson coefficient, r = 0.99; p = 0.0003; Fig. 5
A).; Water within the hydrophobic region is predictive of log PH+/OH−. (A) Correlation plot of log PH+/OH− as a function of the number of times at least three water molecules simultaneously occupied the hydrophobic region anywhere in the lipid membrane over the course of a 50 ns MD simulation.;  The solid line is the best fit to a straight line; dotted lines show the 95% confidence interval from the fit. (B) Correlation plot of log PH+/OH− as a function of the number of times a water cluster appeared in the hydrophobic region of the lipid membrane over the course of a 50 ns MD simulation.;  To observe the effects of tethering, we compared PH+/OH− values from membranes composed of U16 and T32, since T32’s structure is identical to two U16 lipids bonded together at the terminal carbons of their unbranched chains (Fig. 1, B and D).;  A two-tailed Student’s t-test comparing the log-transformed permeability values of T32 and U16 vesicles (Table 1) showed that they were not significantly different (p = 0.46); the spread of the U16 PH+/OH− values fell entirely within the spread of the T32 PH+/OH− values.;  Komatsu and Chong found that the H+/OH− permeability of doubly tethered lipids isolated from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius was relatively invariant with respect to temperature from 25 to 80°C, whereas PH+/OH− values from standard (untethered) eggPC lipids increased dramatically with increasing temperature.;  The PH+/OH− values from the two membrane compositions were comparable at room temperature but diverged greatly at higher temperatures (63).; Based on a two-tailed Student’s t-test comparing log-transformed PH+/OH− values, the mean permeability of liposomes from Di-O-PhyPC lipids was lower (p = 0.059) than that from U16 lipids (Table 1).;  This variability, seen both in this work and in the literature (8, 16, 21, 25, 37, 41, 64, 65), represents a limitation of the usefulness of PH+/OH− data (24, 26).;  We have attempted to identify and minimize potential sources of variation inherent in the process of gathering PH+/OH− values, and we present a detailed discussion on this topic in Section S2 of the Supporting Material.;  The lipid T32, which was tethered by a straight 32-carbon chain, produced membranes with PH+/OH− values similar to those of membranes composed of its untethered equivalent, U16, revealing that tethering does not affect PH+/OH− at room temperature.;  However, PH+/OH− values among tethered lipid membranes increased with increasing tether length if the number of carbons in the untethered acyl tail was constant.",,up
34256694," Furthermore, one of PIP1 gene, CrPIP1;5, was identified as functional using a yeast expression system and transgenic overexpression in Arabidopsis.;  Additionally, a single plasma membrane intrinsic protein gene, CrPIP1;5, was functionally identified using heterogeneous transgenic assays.;  These genes included CrPIP1;5, CrPIP2;2, CrPIP2;3, and CrPIP2;5 (Fig. 6).;  Under high salt stress, CrPIP1;2 showed all induced expression patterns in roots, vines, and leaves, while CrPIP1;1, CrPIP1;3, CrPIP1;4, CrPIP2;1, and CrPIP2;6 showed elevated expression in vine and leaf, and their expression was downregulated in roots.;  The genes CrPIP1;2, CrPIP1;3, CrPIP1;4, CrPIP1;5, CrPIP2;1, CrPIP2;4, CrPIP2;5, and CrPIP2;6 were downregulated in root, while CrPIP1;1, CrPIP1;2, CrPIP2;4, and CrPIP2;5 were slightly upregulated in aerial tissues.;  High osmotic stress increased the expression of CrPIP1;1, CrPIP2;4, and CrPIP2;6, and the ABA treatment increased the expression of CrPIP1;2, CrPIP1;4, CrPIP2;1, and CrPIP2;6 (Fig. 6).; Quantitative RT-PCR detection of the expression levels of the 11 CrPIPs responding to different stresses (600 mM NaCl, 150 mM NaHCO3, 300 mM mannitol, and 100 mM ABA) in C. rosea seedling plants. a 5 CrPIP1s. b 6 CrPIP2s.; A previous study indicated that plant PIP1 and PIP2 members can associate together in heterodimers and tetramers [35]. In our previous study, we have functional identified a C. rosea PIP2 gene, CrPIP2;3, being involved in drought tolerance in transgenic plant [36]. CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 were both initially isolated from C. rosea cDNA library, and these two members showed much higher expression level in different tissues of C. rosea than other CrAQPs (Fig. 5a), which might indicate their relative importance of maintaining water balance in vivo.;  In this study we analyzed two PIP members, CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3, to confirm that CrAQPs could form homodimers or heterodimers.;  To explore CrPIP1;5-CrPIP2;3 interactions, a series of DNA constructs were prepared for a yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 7a).;  Both CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 did not self-activate, but both can form homodimers through direct interactions with themselves(Fig. 7b).;  Furthermore, CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 can interact with each other (Fig. 7c).; Homodimer or Heterodimer of the CrPIP1; 5 and the CrPIP2;3 detection by yeast two-hybrid assay. a Maps of different constructs. b Both the CrPIP1;5 and the CrPIP2;3 showed self-interacting. c The CrPIP1;5 and the CrPIP2;3 could interact each other; We performed functional identification of CrPIP1;5 using a yeast expression system, constructing with a CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 recombinant vector (Fig. 8a).;  As seen in Fig. 8b, W303 transformed with either CrPIP1;5 or pYES2 developed normally and did not differ in growth rate from the SDG control plate.;  However, with the addition of PEG8000 or sorbitol, W303 transformed with CrPIP1;5 showed an obvious growth lag compared to yeast containing the pYES2 control.;  When NaCl was added to the SDG medium, the W303 yeast containing CrPIP1;5 showed better growth than the control (Fig. 8b).;  CrPIP1;5 resulted in increased H2O2 sensitivity of yeast and lower growth rates, while both the BY4741 strain and the H2O2-sensitive mutant strain skn7Δ showed similar growth performance to the SDG control plate (Fig. 8c).;  These results indicate that, at least in yeast cells, CrPIP1;5 is an active H2O and H2O2 transporter.; The spot assays for stress tolerance confirmation of the CrPIP1;5 expression in yeast. a Map of the CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 construct. b High osmotic stress and salt tolerance confirmation in yeast.;  The growth state of yeast cells (WT, BY4741) transformed with CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 and empty vector pYES2 with or without PEG8000, sorbitol, or NaCl on SDG-Ura plates.;  The growth state of yeast cells (WT and H2O2-sensitive mutant strain skn7Δ) transformed with CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 and empty vector pYES2 with or without H2O2 on SDG-Ura plates.; To further assess the effects of CrPIP1;5, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants that ectopically expressed CrPIP1;5 under the control of 35S promoters.;  Although our seed germinating assays indicated that CrPIP1;5 OX lines showed no significant difference on germination rates under salt, salt-alkaline, or high osmotic challenges compared with WT seeds (Figure S3), while in the seedling growth assays, CrPIP1;5 OX line seedlings showed slightly growth retardation on the salt and salt-alkaline MS plates compared with WT control (Figure S4).; The seeds of WT and CrPIP1;5 OX lines were grown in well-watered conditions for 30 days, and prior to the salt, drought, and alkaline stress treatments, the growth rates of adult plants (WT and three CrPIP1;5 OX lines) were relatively consistent.;  Apparently, CrPIP1;5 resulted in weak sensitivity to drought (Fig. 9a).;  After 10 days of water withdrawal, all plants wilted to some degree in both WT and the three CrPIP1;5 OX lines.;  After re-watering and growing for another 7 days, most of the CrPIP1;5 OX plants did not recover, while most of the WT plants did recover and had a higher survival rate than CrPIP1;5 OX plants (Fig. 9b).;  This result indicates that overexpression of CrPIP1;5 decreased plant resistance to drought.; Drought stress treatment on the growth of the transgenic CrPIP1;5 overexpression lines (OX 1#, OX 5#, and OX 10#) and wild-type (WT) plants under natural growth conditions in vermiculite. a Leaf phenotypes of the transgenic line and WT plants under drought treatment. b The survival rates of the OX lines and WT plants.; We found that GFP-fused CrPIP1;5 was constitutively expressed (under the control of CaMV 35S) in transgenic Arabidopsis plants.;  Root tip fluorescence of roughly three- to four-day-old transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings was easily discerned by confocal microscopy; the GFP-CrPIP1;5 protein was visible in the plasma membranes of transgenic plants, while in control plant roots, the GFP signal was distributed evenly in the whole cytoplasm (Figure S6).;  These results suggest that subcellular localization of CrPIP1;5 was consistent across the PIP1 subfamily and was predominantly localized to the plasma membrane, as well as partly in endomembrane system.;  Within the plasma membrane, CrPIP1;5 was folded into a specific transmembrane channel and functioned as a water transporter.;  Two AQP genes from G. soja, GsTIP2;1 and GsPIP2;1, minimized tolerance to salt and dehydration stress when overexpressed in Arabidopsis, implying they have negative impacts on stress tolerance by regulating water potential [43, 44]. In most functional analyses conducted in transgenic plants, the overexpression of AQP genes caused elevated tolerance to salt and drought, such as in Malus zumi (gene MzPIP2;1) [45], Sesuvium portulacastrum (SpAQP1) [46], Stipa purpurea (SpPIP1) [47], Simmondsia chinensis (ScPIP1) [48], Thellungiella salsuginea (TsPIP1;1) [49], and Phoenix dactylifera (PdPIP1;2) [50]. The elevated expression of AQP genes in plants can lead to cellular changes in water potential, which cause alterations in water uptake and transpiration, and ultimately modify tolerance to water deficit stress.; In our previous research, we have characterized CrPIP2;3 as a salt/drought stress related gene [36]. Here we performed protein–protein interaction studies using yeast two-hybrid assays and found that two CrPIP members, encoded by CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3, that were highly expressed in all tested tissues and almost constitutively expressed under the abiotic stress challenges and ABA treatment (Figs. 5a and ​and6).6).;  This is consistent with previous findings that some PIP1 and PIP2 members could assemble as homotetramers and heterotetramers, thereby triggering channel activities, influencing substrate specificity, and regulating PIP trafficking [56]. Here, our results on the expression patterns of CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 provide a detailed understanding of their regulatory modes and help to illuminate CrAQP functions.; Our results from the yeast overexpression system indicate that CrPIP1;5 is an active transmembrane H2O and H2O2 transporter (Fig. 8).;  We assessed the overexpression of CrPIP1;5 in transgenic Arabidopsis, and CrPIP1;5 lead to slightly reduced saline-alkaline and drought tolerance, which showed the exact opposite phenotype compared with CrPIP2;3’s overexpression in Arabidopsis [36]. This also suggests that CrPIP1;5 could play a key role in water transport.;  Here we speculated that as a foreign AQP gene, CrPIP1;5 might be involved in modifying the function of endogenous PIPs of Arabidopsis, or function more in water flowing out than water absorption in transgenic Arabidopsis roots, thereby resulted in sensitivity to salt and drought stresses.;  We also found that high levels of salt, alkaline, and ABA slightly decreased the expression of CrPIP1;5 in C. rosea, this further suggests that this gene is highly important for water movement between cells and tissues, and is indeed involved in a stress response pathway that protects yeast cells or plants from water loss under high salinity conditions and promotes water release under high osmotic stress or drought (Figs. 8b and ​and9).9).;  The overexpression of CrPIP1;5 in transgenic Arabidopsis is in contrast to most previous findings [40, 54], suggesting that overexpression of plant PIPs results in specificities of abiotic stress tolerance or sensitivity, which also might be attributed to the protein interaction, post-translational modifications (PTM), protein trafficking of the foreign AQP.;  While in C. rosea, our results about the expression pattern of CrPIP1;5 regarding to different tissues or habitats (Fig. 5), as well as the transcriptional changes responding to salinity/alkaline, high osmotic stress, and ABA treatment (Fig. 6a), indicated that CrPIP1;5 might be boiled down to a “housekeeping gene” for basic water homeostasis, to some degree.;  Even the CrPIP1;5 showed higher expression level in YX sample than in SCBG sample (leaves) (Fig. 5b), which might be probably due to the long-term adaptive mechanism that C. rosea plants on YX island have to deal with much tougher water-deficit adversities than plants in SCBG, including water absorption from the external environment and water transportation in vivo.;  The slightly decreased expression of CrPIP1;5 in C. rosea seedlings caused by stress factors or ABA (Fig. 6a), which might be an emergency protection for alleviating the damages caused by water disturbances, since we only checked the CrPIP1;5’s expression changes in 24 h challenged by different factors.;  For example, tobacco PIP1 member, NtAQP1, caused a decline of root hydraulic conductivity and decreased resistance of plants to water stress [57]. Transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants overexpressing AtPIP1;4 and AtPIP2;5 displayed rapid water loss under dehydration stress and showed enhanced water flow under drought stress [58]. The Glycine soja gene GsPIP2;1 negatively impact salt and drought stress tolerance by regulating water potential when overexpressed in transgenic Arabidopsis [44]. In addition, Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AcPIP2 (a PIP gene from saltbush A. canescens) exhibited drought-sensitive phenotypes [41]. This can be explained by the nature and intensity of stresses, combining with the cooperation between the over-expressed foreign AQPs and the endogenous AQPs.;  In our study, the over-expression of CrPIP1;5 showed some sensitivity both in yeast and in Arabidopsis, which only reflect CrPIP1;5 did involve in water stress responses in vivo.;  Overall, as an active water channel protein with high expression levels in C. rosea different tissues or challenged by different factors, the CrPIP1;5, as well as the CrPIP2;3, might be basic sustainers for water homeostasis during the development of C. rosea plants.;  As predicted, the two PIP1 and PIP2 members, CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3, formed homodimers and heterodimers through protein interactions.;  We also functionally identified one of the CrPIP1 members, CrPIP1;5, given its highest expression levels in different tissues of C. rosea.;  Although our results showed that overexpression of CrPIP1;5 could increase sensitivity to saline-alkaline and drought conditions in yeast and plants, combining the high and regulatable expression of CrPIP1;5 in C. rosea, it can be inferred that CrPIP1;5 is one of basic and important functional genes for facilitating water transportation in vivo, and might be involved in the C. rosea ecological adaptation to tropical coral reef.; The full-length cDNAs of CrPIP1;5 (GenBank accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MT787665"",""term_id"":""2063684758""}}MT787665) and CrPIP2;3 (GenBank accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MT787666"",""term_id"":""2063684760""}}MT787666) were isolated from the cDNA library of C. rosea seedlings, in which all cDNAs were inserted into a yeast expression vector (pYES-DEST52) using Gateway® techniques (Life Technologies).;  The recombinant plasmids containing CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 cDNAs were designated as CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 and CrPIP2;3-pYES-DEST52 and used as template DNA in the following PCR assays.;  The open reading frame (ORF) regions of CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 were PCR-amplified using the primer pairs PIP1-5BDF/PIP1-5BDR and PIP2-3BDF/PIP2-3BDR, respectively (Table S2), and then inserted into a pGBKT7 vector using InFusion® techniques (In-Fusion HD® Cloning System, Clontech) to construct the pGBKT7-CrPIP1;5 and pGBKT7-CrPIP2;3 bait plasmids.;  The prey plasmid, pGADT7-CrPIP1;5, and pGADT7-CrPIP2;3, were generated by cloning the CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 ORFs into the pGADT7 vector after amplification (using the primers PIP1-5ADF/PIP1-5ADR, PIP2-3ADF/PIP2-3ADR as above; Table S2).; The recombinant plasmids CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 and the empty vector pYES2 (a negative control) were transformed into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild type strains W303 (MATa; his3-11_15; leu2-3_112; ura3-1; trp1Δ2; ade2-1; can1-100), WT (BY47471; MATa; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0), and H2O2-sensitive mutant skn7Δ (BY4741; MATa; ura3Δ0; leu2Δ0; his3Δ1; met15Δ0; YHR206w::kanMX4).; The coding sequence (CDS) of the CrPIP1;5 cDNA was PCR-amplified using the primer pair PIP1-5OXGF/PIP1-5OXGR (Table S2) and then inserted into plant expression vector pEGAD to generate CrPIP1;5-pEGAD.;  These tests were thereby meant to evaluate the biological functions of CrPIP1;5.; In brief, seed germination rate of the CrPIP1;5 transgenic Arabidopsis (OX 1#, OX 5#, OX 10#, and WT) was measured under the following stress treatments: NaCl (175 mM, 200 mM, and 225 mM; salt stress); 5 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 95 mmol/L NaCl (pH 8.2), 7.5 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 92.5 mmol/L NaCl (pH 8.2), and 10 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 90 mmol/L NaCl (pH 8.2; alkaline stress); mannitol (200 mM, 300 mM, and 400 mM) stress.;  The goal of these treatments was to detect the effect of the overexpression of CrPIP1;5 on affecting the salt/alkaline/osmotic tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis seeds during germination.;  Additionally, root length was calculated to evaluate the influence of the overexpression of CrPIP1;5 on transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings under abiotic stress (100 mM, 150 mM, and 200 mM NaCl for salt stress; 0.5 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 99.5 mmol/L NaCl, 0.75 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 99.25 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 99 mmol/L NaCl, pH 8.2 for alkaline stress; 200 mM, 300 mM, and 400 mM mannitol for osmotic stress.; Subcellular localization of CrPIP1;5 in Arabidopsis was also detected using GFP fusion protein in seedling roots.;  The OX homozygous lines of CrPIP1;5-pEGAD and the control (pEGAD) transgenic plants were sterilized and spotted in MS plates to generate seedlings.",,down
34256694," Furthermore, one of PIP1 gene, CrPIP1;5, was identified as functional using a yeast expression system and transgenic overexpression in Arabidopsis.;  Additionally, a single plasma membrane intrinsic protein gene, CrPIP1;5, was functionally identified using heterogeneous transgenic assays.;  These genes included CrPIP1;5, CrPIP2;2, CrPIP2;3, and CrPIP2;5 (Fig. 6).;  Under high salt stress, CrPIP1;2 showed all induced expression patterns in roots, vines, and leaves, while CrPIP1;1, CrPIP1;3, CrPIP1;4, CrPIP2;1, and CrPIP2;6 showed elevated expression in vine and leaf, and their expression was downregulated in roots.;  The genes CrPIP1;2, CrPIP1;3, CrPIP1;4, CrPIP1;5, CrPIP2;1, CrPIP2;4, CrPIP2;5, and CrPIP2;6 were downregulated in root, while CrPIP1;1, CrPIP1;2, CrPIP2;4, and CrPIP2;5 were slightly upregulated in aerial tissues.;  High osmotic stress increased the expression of CrPIP1;1, CrPIP2;4, and CrPIP2;6, and the ABA treatment increased the expression of CrPIP1;2, CrPIP1;4, CrPIP2;1, and CrPIP2;6 (Fig. 6).; Quantitative RT-PCR detection of the expression levels of the 11 CrPIPs responding to different stresses (600 mM NaCl, 150 mM NaHCO3, 300 mM mannitol, and 100 mM ABA) in C. rosea seedling plants. a 5 CrPIP1s. b 6 CrPIP2s.; A previous study indicated that plant PIP1 and PIP2 members can associate together in heterodimers and tetramers [35]. In our previous study, we have functional identified a C. rosea PIP2 gene, CrPIP2;3, being involved in drought tolerance in transgenic plant [36]. CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 were both initially isolated from C. rosea cDNA library, and these two members showed much higher expression level in different tissues of C. rosea than other CrAQPs (Fig. 5a), which might indicate their relative importance of maintaining water balance in vivo.;  In this study we analyzed two PIP members, CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3, to confirm that CrAQPs could form homodimers or heterodimers.;  To explore CrPIP1;5-CrPIP2;3 interactions, a series of DNA constructs were prepared for a yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 7a).;  Both CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 did not self-activate, but both can form homodimers through direct interactions with themselves(Fig. 7b).;  Furthermore, CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 can interact with each other (Fig. 7c).;

We performed functional identification of CrPIP1;5 using a yeast expression system, constructing with a CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 recombinant vector (Fig. 8a).;  As seen in Fig. 8b, W303 transformed with either CrPIP1;5 or pYES2 developed normally and did not differ in growth rate from the SDG control plate.;  However, with the addition of PEG8000 or sorbitol, W303 transformed with CrPIP1;5 showed an obvious growth lag compared to yeast containing the pYES2 control.;  When NaCl was added to the SDG medium, the W303 yeast containing CrPIP1;5 showed better growth than the control (Fig. 8b).;  CrPIP1;5 resulted in increased H2O2 sensitivity of yeast and lower growth rates, while both the BY4741 strain and the H2O2-sensitive mutant strain skn7Δ showed similar growth performance to the SDG control plate (Fig. 8c).;  These results indicate that, at least in yeast cells, CrPIP1;5 is an active H2O and H2O2 transporter.; The spot assays for stress tolerance confirmation of the CrPIP1;5 expression in yeast. a Map of the CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 construct. b High osmotic stress and salt tolerance confirmation in yeast.;  The growth state of yeast cells (WT, BY4741) transformed with CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 and empty vector pYES2 with or without PEG8000, sorbitol, or NaCl on SDG-Ura plates.;  The growth state of yeast cells (WT and H2O2-sensitive mutant strain skn7Δ) transformed with CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 and empty vector pYES2 with or without H2O2 on SDG-Ura plates.; To further assess the effects of CrPIP1;5, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants that ectopically expressed CrPIP1;5 under the control of 35S promoters.;  Although our seed germinating assays indicated that CrPIP1;5 OX lines showed no significant difference on germination rates under salt, salt-alkaline, or high osmotic challenges compared with WT seeds (Figure S3), while in the seedling growth assays, CrPIP1;5 OX line seedlings showed slightly growth retardation on the salt and salt-alkaline MS plates compared with WT control (Figure S4).; The seeds of WT and CrPIP1;5 OX lines were grown in well-watered conditions for 30 days, and prior to the salt, drought, and alkaline stress treatments, the growth rates of adult plants (WT and three CrPIP1;5 OX lines) were relatively consistent.;  Apparently, CrPIP1;5 resulted in weak sensitivity to drought (Fig. 9a).;  After 10 days of water withdrawal, all plants wilted to some degree in both WT and the three CrPIP1;5 OX lines.;  After re-watering and growing for another 7 days, most of the CrPIP1;5 OX plants did not recover, while most of the WT plants did recover and had a higher survival rate than CrPIP1;5 OX plants (Fig. 9b).;  This result indicates that overexpression of CrPIP1;5 decreased plant resistance to drought.; Drought stress treatment on the growth of the transgenic CrPIP1;5 overexpression lines (OX 1#, OX 5#, and OX 10#) and wild-type (WT) plants under natural growth conditions in vermiculite. a Leaf phenotypes of the transgenic line and WT plants under drought treatment. b The survival rates of the OX lines and WT plants.; We found that GFP-fused CrPIP1;5 was constitutively expressed (under the control of CaMV 35S) in transgenic Arabidopsis plants.;  Root tip fluorescence of roughly three- to four-day-old transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings was easily discerned by confocal microscopy; the GFP-CrPIP1;5 protein was visible in the plasma membranes of transgenic plants, while in control plant roots, the GFP signal was distributed evenly in the whole cytoplasm (Figure S6).;  These results suggest that subcellular localization of CrPIP1;5 was consistent across the PIP1 subfamily and was predominantly localized to the plasma membrane, as well as partly in endomembrane system.;  Within the plasma membrane, CrPIP1;5 was folded into a specific transmembrane channel and functioned as a water transporter.;  Two AQP genes from G. soja, GsTIP2;1 and GsPIP2;1, minimized tolerance to salt and dehydration stress when overexpressed in Arabidopsis, implying they have negative impacts on stress tolerance by regulating water potential [43, 44]. In most functional analyses conducted in transgenic plants, the overexpression of AQP genes caused elevated tolerance to salt and drought, such as in Malus zumi (gene MzPIP2;1) [45], Sesuvium portulacastrum (SpAQP1) [46], Stipa purpurea (SpPIP1) [47], Simmondsia chinensis (ScPIP1) [48], Thellungiella salsuginea (TsPIP1;1) [49], and Phoenix dactylifera (PdPIP1;2) [50]. The elevated expression of AQP genes in plants can lead to cellular changes in water potential, which cause alterations in water uptake and transpiration, and ultimately modify tolerance to water deficit stress.; In our previous research, we have characterized CrPIP2;3 as a salt/drought stress related gene [36]. Here we performed protein–protein interaction studies using yeast two-hybrid assays and found that two CrPIP members, encoded by CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3, that were highly expressed in all tested tissues and almost constitutively expressed under the abiotic stress challenges and ABA treatment (Figs. 5a and ​and6).6).;  This is consistent with previous findings that some PIP1 and PIP2 members could assemble as homotetramers and heterotetramers, thereby triggering channel activities, influencing substrate specificity, and regulating PIP trafficking [56]. Here, our results on the expression patterns of CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 provide a detailed understanding of their regulatory modes and help to illuminate CrAQP functions.; Our results from the yeast overexpression system indicate that CrPIP1;5 is an active transmembrane H2O and H2O2 transporter (Fig. 8).;  We assessed the overexpression of CrPIP1;5 in transgenic Arabidopsis, and CrPIP1;5 lead to slightly reduced saline-alkaline and drought tolerance, which showed the exact opposite phenotype compared with CrPIP2;3’s overexpression in Arabidopsis [36]. This also suggests that CrPIP1;5 could play a key role in water transport.;  Here we speculated that as a foreign AQP gene, CrPIP1;5 might be involved in modifying the function of endogenous PIPs of Arabidopsis, or function more in water flowing out than water absorption in transgenic Arabidopsis roots, thereby resulted in sensitivity to salt and drought stresses.;  We also found that high levels of salt, alkaline, and ABA slightly decreased the expression of CrPIP1;5 in C. rosea, this further suggests that this gene is highly important for water movement between cells and tissues, and is indeed involved in a stress response pathway that protects yeast cells or plants from water loss under high salinity conditions and promotes water release under high osmotic stress or drought (Figs. 8b and ​and9).9).;  The overexpression of CrPIP1;5 in transgenic Arabidopsis is in contrast to most previous findings [40, 54], suggesting that overexpression of plant PIPs results in specificities of abiotic stress tolerance or sensitivity, which also might be attributed to the protein interaction, post-translational modifications (PTM), protein trafficking of the foreign AQP.;  While in C. rosea, our results about the expression pattern of CrPIP1;5 regarding to different tissues or habitats (Fig. 5), as well as the transcriptional changes responding to salinity/alkaline, high osmotic stress, and ABA treatment (Fig. 6a), indicated that CrPIP1;5 might be boiled down to a “housekeeping gene” for basic water homeostasis, to some degree.;  Even the CrPIP1;5 showed higher expression level in YX sample than in SCBG sample (leaves) (Fig. 5b), which might be probably due to the long-term adaptive mechanism that C. rosea plants on YX island have to deal with much tougher water-deficit adversities than plants in SCBG, including water absorption from the external environment and water transportation in vivo.;  The slightly decreased expression of CrPIP1;5 in C. rosea seedlings caused by stress factors or ABA (Fig. 6a), which might be an emergency protection for alleviating the damages caused by water disturbances, since we only checked the CrPIP1;5’s expression changes in 24 h challenged by different factors.;  For example, tobacco PIP1 member, NtAQP1, caused a decline of root hydraulic conductivity and decreased resistance of plants to water stress [57]. Transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants overexpressing AtPIP1;4 and AtPIP2;5 displayed rapid water loss under dehydration stress and showed enhanced water flow under drought stress [58]. The Glycine soja gene GsPIP2;1 negatively impact salt and drought stress tolerance by regulating water potential when overexpressed in transgenic Arabidopsis [44]. In addition, Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AcPIP2 (a PIP gene from saltbush A. canescens) exhibited drought-sensitive phenotypes [41]. This can be explained by the nature and intensity of stresses, combining with the cooperation between the over-expressed foreign AQPs and the endogenous AQPs.;  In our study, the over-expression of CrPIP1;5 showed some sensitivity both in yeast and in Arabidopsis, which only reflect CrPIP1;5 did involve in water stress responses in vivo.;  Overall, as an active water channel protein with high expression levels in C. rosea different tissues or challenged by different factors, the CrPIP1;5, as well as the CrPIP2;3, might be basic sustainers for water homeostasis during the development of C. rosea plants.;  As predicted, the two PIP1 and PIP2 members, CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3, formed homodimers and heterodimers through protein interactions.;  We also functionally identified one of the CrPIP1 members, CrPIP1;5, given its highest expression levels in different tissues of C. rosea.;  Although our results showed that overexpression of CrPIP1;5 could increase sensitivity to saline-alkaline and drought conditions in yeast and plants, combining the high and regulatable expression of CrPIP1;5 in C. rosea, it can be inferred that CrPIP1;5 is one of basic and important functional genes for facilitating water transportation in vivo, and might be involved in the C. rosea ecological adaptation to tropical coral reef.; The full-length cDNAs of CrPIP1;5 (GenBank accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MT787665"",""term_id"":""2063684758""}}MT787665) and CrPIP2;3 (GenBank accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MT787666"",""term_id"":""2063684760""}}MT787666) were isolated from the cDNA library of C. rosea seedlings, in which all cDNAs were inserted into a yeast expression vector (pYES-DEST52) using Gateway® techniques (Life Technologies).;  The recombinant plasmids containing CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 cDNAs were designated as CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 and CrPIP2;3-pYES-DEST52 and used as template DNA in the following PCR assays.;  The open reading frame (ORF) regions of CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 were PCR-amplified using the primer pairs PIP1-5BDF/PIP1-5BDR and PIP2-3BDF/PIP2-3BDR, respectively (Table S2), and then inserted into a pGBKT7 vector using InFusion® techniques (In-Fusion HD® Cloning System, Clontech) to construct the pGBKT7-CrPIP1;5 and pGBKT7-CrPIP2;3 bait plasmids.;  The prey plasmid, pGADT7-CrPIP1;5, and pGADT7-CrPIP2;3, were generated by cloning the CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 ORFs into the pGADT7 vector after amplification (using the primers PIP1-5ADF/PIP1-5ADR, PIP2-3ADF/PIP2-3ADR as above; Table S2).; The recombinant plasmids CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 and the empty vector pYES2 (a negative control) were transformed into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild type strains W303 (MATa; his3-11_15; leu2-3_112; ura3-1; trp1Δ2; ade2-1; can1-100), WT (BY47471; MATa; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0), and H2O2-sensitive mutant skn7Δ (BY4741; MATa; ura3Δ0; leu2Δ0; his3Δ1; met15Δ0; YHR206w::kanMX4).; The coding sequence (CDS) of the CrPIP1;5 cDNA was PCR-amplified using the primer pair PIP1-5OXGF/PIP1-5OXGR (Table S2) and then inserted into plant expression vector pEGAD to generate CrPIP1;5-pEGAD.;  These tests were thereby meant to evaluate the biological functions of CrPIP1;5.; In brief, seed germination rate of the CrPIP1;5 transgenic Arabidopsis (OX 1#, OX 5#, OX 10#, and WT) was measured under the following stress treatments: NaCl (175 mM, 200 mM, and 225 mM; salt stress); 5 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 95 mmol/L NaCl (pH 8.2), 7.5 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 92.5 mmol/L NaCl (pH 8.2), and 10 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 90 mmol/L NaCl (pH 8.2; alkaline stress); mannitol (200 mM, 300 mM, and 400 mM) stress.;  The goal of these treatments was to detect the effect of the overexpression of CrPIP1;5 on affecting the salt/alkaline/osmotic tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis seeds during germination.;  Additionally, root length was calculated to evaluate the influence of the overexpression of CrPIP1;5 on transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings under abiotic stress (100 mM, 150 mM, and 200 mM NaCl for salt stress; 0.5 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 99.5 mmol/L NaCl, 0.75 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 99.25 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 99 mmol/L NaCl, pH 8.2 for alkaline stress; 200 mM, 300 mM, and 400 mM mannitol for osmotic stress.; Subcellular localization of CrPIP1;5 in Arabidopsis was also detected using GFP fusion protein in seedling roots.;  The OX homozygous lines of CrPIP1;5-pEGAD and the control (pEGAD) transgenic plants were sterilized and spotted in MS plates to generate seedlings.",,down

32533304," While many studies have investigated microorganisms in the air and dust, tap water, another major input of microbial propagules, has received far less attention.;  Indoor water-borne microorganisms are not confined only to bathrooms and kitchens but can also populate tap water systems and household appliances, in which they can be attracted to certain chemicals and plastic or rubber surfaces.;  Some algal species belonging to the genera Scenedesmus, Euglena, Anacystis, Coelastrum, Prototheca and Chlorococcum can be found in tap water systems, despite chlorination, and can survive without light (Defra 2011).;  Algae in tap water systems are particularly problematic as reservoirs of certain bacteria (e.g.;  According to the WHO, algae producing toxins, and those causing bad taste or odour, should be absent from tap water (WHO 2011).;  Biofilms in tap water systems may contain up to 8.9 CFU/cm2 of yeasts and 4.0–25.2 CFU/cm2 of filamentous fungi (Doggett 2000).; Bacteria are the most numerous microorganisms in tap water and biofilms of the water distribution system.;  The most problematic bacteria potentially found in tap water according to WHO are Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhi, Shigella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, E. coli, Yersinia enterolitica, Legionella spp., Aeromonas spp., Mycobacterium spp., Bacillus spp. and P. aeruginosa (WHO 2011; EEC 1998).;  The number of bacteria reaches its lowest limits in water tanks after treatment procedures (e.g. chlorination), while in tap water the number of bacteria increases again due to the presence of biofilms in plumbing systems (Kormas et al. 2010).;  Thus, the numbers of CFU in groundwater can be up to 106 CFU/mL, in well water up to 103 CFU/mL, in reservoir tanks after chlorination up to 102 CFU/mL and in household tap water between 102 and 105 CFU/mL (Kormas et al. 2010; Callewaert et al. 2015).;  Typical bacteria in ground and well water are Betaproteobacteria (Kormas et al. 2010).;  In biofilms of the lower parts of the plumbing system (e.g. basement and first floor), in systems with regular water consumption and relatively high water flow, Alphaproteobacteria dominate over Betaproteobacteria (Inkinen et al. 2016).;  This is also true in copper pipes (Inkinen et al. 2016), while cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) pipes in combination with hot water appear to select for Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacilli (Callewaert et al. 2015; Inkinen et al. 2016; Moat et al. 2016).; Microorganisms entering buildings via tap water become exposed to different physico-chemical factors, which shape the diversity of the communities in indoor habitats.;  Although outdoor and indoor air and water are known sources of microbial contamination of kitchens, human skin was found to be the primary source of bacteria belonging to the families Propionibacteriaceae, Corynebacteriaceae, Staphylococcaceae and Streptococcaceae (Flores et al. 2011; Flores et al. 2012).; Staphylococcus spp.; Staphylococcus spp.; Staphylococcus aureus; Stapleton et al. 2013; Staphylococcus aureus;  Recently, conducted studies suggested tap water as an important additional vector (Novak Babič et al. 2016b).;  Ubiquitous genera of filamentous fungi like Aspergillus, Cladosporium and Penicillium were present mainly on surfaces exposed to outdoor air (e.g. sills next to windows) (Adams et al. 2013), while moist surfaces in regular contact with water harboured yeasts from the genera Apiotrichum, Candida, Cryptococcus, Cystobasidium, Issatchenkia, Malassezia, Meyerozyma, Naganishia, Hyphopichia, Pichia, Rhodotorula, Trichosporon, Wickerhamiella and Wickerhamomyces, and black yeasts Aureobasidium, Capronia, Cyphellophora, Cladophialophora, Exophiala, Fonsecaea, Knufia, Phialophora and Rhinocladiella (Table ​(Table1)1) (Zupančič et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2018), many of which were previously reported also from tap water (Zupančič et al. 2016; Novak Babič et al. 2016b).;  The major ones are tap water, human skin and oral biota, and faecal contamination (in case of coliform bacteria) (Ankola et al. 2009).;  Other skin- and faeces-related bacteria, such as those from the genera Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Serratia, Enterococcus, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus spp. could be found on the floor, drains, sinks, toilet seats and counters across the bathrooms (Table ​(Table1)1) (Cole et al. 2003).; Similarly to bacteria, fungi colonising bathroom surfaces can also originate from tap water or skin.;  These genera can be isolated from taps, sinks and seals between ceramic bathroom tiles (Fig. ​(Fig.2)2) (Wang et al. 2018).;  In the following studies, results confirmed the existence of a core mycobiota (Zupančič et al. 2016) and identified tap water as the main source of contamination of dishwashers with these fungi (Novak Babič et al. 2016b).;  The most tested bacteria showed high resistance to antibiotics such as cefotaxime, ceftazidime and ertapenem, while genes for virulence markers were detected only in P. aeruginosa strains.;  To evaluate water as the possible vector of contamination of dishwashers with bacteria, a metagenomic analysis of bacterial diversity in tap water was conducted.;  The study showed the dominance of Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria in the water, while Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were present in much lower numbers.;  Genera Pseudomonas, Pantoea, Sphingobacterium, Flavobacterium, Carnobacterium, Lactobacillus, Arthrobacter, Bacillus and Staphylococcus, which dominated the interior of refrigerators (Table ​(Table1),1), were usually associated with stored food, especially untreated meat and vegetables (Jeon et al. 2013).;  Several studies reported colonisation of washing machines with bacteria from the genera Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Clostridium, Corynebacterium, Escherichia, Micrococcus, Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus (Table ​(Table1)1) (Perry et al. 2001; Panagea et al. 2005; Novak Babič et al. 2015).;  Particularly problematic is the presence of species Clostridium difficile, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa on laundry, since cross-contamination from laundry can occur, resulting in nosocomial infections (Rozman et al. 2013).;  Transfer and enrichment of some bacterial groups was shown also for cotton fabrics supporting the growth of the genera Enhydrobacter, Corynebacterium and Acinetobacter, while polyester fabrics in general favoured the growth of Micrococcus and Staphylococcus (Callewaert et al. 2015).;  However, their presence in washing machines causes persistent unpleasant odour due to bacterial degradation of detergents and other organic matter present on clothes and in the water and they are released into waste greywater, which exits the washing machines (Munk et al. 2001; Stapleton et al. 2013; Callewaert et al. 2015).; Although degradation of detergents, especially softeners, was reported also for various fungi, they are not involved in the development of unpleasant odour of clothes or washing machines (Stapleton et al. 2013; Novak Babič et al. 2015).;  Most fungi isolated from washing machines entered via tap water.;  The most contaminated sites were plastic parts (e.g. drawers for detergents) and rubber seals (Gattlen et al. 2010; Kubota et al. 2012; Stapleton et al. 2013; Novak Babič et al. 2015).;  Bacteria, such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus spp., can survive the high temperatures in dryers, resulting in clinical outbreaks especially in hospital environments (Brunton 1995; Fijan and Šostar Turk 2012).;  Bacterial biofilms on stainless steel were reported to be thinner and easier to remove than those found on polyethylene, which contained a higher proportion of viable bacteria—an important consideration when for example choosing the material of a kitchen sink, but also of tap water piping systems, where the formation of biofilms is linked with numerous problems impacting the safety of tap water.;  In the investigation of materials used in tap water piping systems, rubber turned out to be by far the most problematic material in terms of biofilm formation (Szczotko et al. 2016).;  While some of these traits are known for Candida spp., Fusarium oxysporum (FOSC) and F. solani complexes (FSSC), all of these are characteristic for the black yeast E. dermatitidis, dominant fungus in dishwashers around the world (Zalar et al. 2011; Lavrin et al. 2020), and A. melanogenum prevailing in tap water (Novak Babič et al. 2016b, 2017a).;  These biofilms can be established on interior materials due to the constant presence of water, either entering the appliance from the tap water distribution system or condensing on the surface.",,up
