34256694,8278772," Furthermore, one of PIP1 gene, CrPIP1;5, was identified as functional using a yeast expression system and transgenic overexpression in Arabidopsis.;  Additionally, a single plasma membrane intrinsic protein gene, CrPIP1;5, was functionally identified using heterogeneous transgenic assays.;  These genes included CrPIP1;5, CrPIP2;2, CrPIP2;3, and CrPIP2;5 (Fig. 6).;  Under high salt stress, CrPIP1;2 showed all induced expression patterns in roots, vines, and leaves, while CrPIP1;1, CrPIP1;3, CrPIP1;4, CrPIP2;1, and CrPIP2;6 showed elevated expression in vine and leaf, and their expression was downregulated in roots.;  The genes CrPIP1;2, CrPIP1;3, CrPIP1;4, CrPIP1;5, CrPIP2;1, CrPIP2;4, CrPIP2;5, and CrPIP2;6 were downregulated in root, while CrPIP1;1, CrPIP1;2, CrPIP2;4, and CrPIP2;5 were slightly upregulated in aerial tissues.;  High osmotic stress increased the expression of CrPIP1;1, CrPIP2;4, and CrPIP2;6, and the ABA treatment increased the expression of CrPIP1;2, CrPIP1;4, CrPIP2;1, and CrPIP2;6 (Fig. 6).; Quantitative RT-PCR detection of the expression levels of the 11 CrPIPs responding to different stresses (600 mM NaCl, 150 mM NaHCO3, 300 mM mannitol, and 100 mM ABA) in C. rosea seedling plants. a 5 CrPIP1s. b 6 CrPIP2s.; A previous study indicated that plant PIP1 and PIP2 members can associate together in heterodimers and tetramers [35]. In our previous study, we have functional identified a C. rosea PIP2 gene, CrPIP2;3, being involved in drought tolerance in transgenic plant [36]. CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 were both initially isolated from C. rosea cDNA library, and these two members showed much higher expression level in different tissues of C. rosea than other CrAQPs (Fig. 5a), which might indicate their relative importance of maintaining water balance in vivo.;  In this study we analyzed two PIP members, CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3, to confirm that CrAQPs could form homodimers or heterodimers.;  To explore CrPIP1;5-CrPIP2;3 interactions, a series of DNA constructs were prepared for a yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 7a).;  Both CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 did not self-activate, but both can form homodimers through direct interactions with themselves(Fig. 7b).;  Furthermore, CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 can interact with each other (Fig. 7c).; Homodimer or Heterodimer of the CrPIP1; 5 and the CrPIP2;3 detection by yeast two-hybrid assay. a Maps of different constructs. b Both the CrPIP1;5 and the CrPIP2;3 showed self-interacting. c The CrPIP1;5 and the CrPIP2;3 could interact each other; We performed functional identification of CrPIP1;5 using a yeast expression system, constructing with a CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 recombinant vector (Fig. 8a).;  As seen in Fig. 8b, W303 transformed with either CrPIP1;5 or pYES2 developed normally and did not differ in growth rate from the SDG control plate.;  However, with the addition of PEG8000 or sorbitol, W303 transformed with CrPIP1;5 showed an obvious growth lag compared to yeast containing the pYES2 control.;  When NaCl was added to the SDG medium, the W303 yeast containing CrPIP1;5 showed better growth than the control (Fig. 8b).;  CrPIP1;5 resulted in increased H2O2 sensitivity of yeast and lower growth rates, while both the BY4741 strain and the H2O2-sensitive mutant strain skn7Δ showed similar growth performance to the SDG control plate (Fig. 8c).;  These results indicate that, at least in yeast cells, CrPIP1;5 is an active H2O and H2O2 transporter.; The spot assays for stress tolerance confirmation of the CrPIP1;5 expression in yeast. a Map of the CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 construct. b High osmotic stress and salt tolerance confirmation in yeast.;  The growth state of yeast cells (WT, BY4741) transformed with CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 and empty vector pYES2 with or without PEG8000, sorbitol, or NaCl on SDG-Ura plates.;  The growth state of yeast cells (WT and H2O2-sensitive mutant strain skn7Δ) transformed with CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 and empty vector pYES2 with or without H2O2 on SDG-Ura plates.; To further assess the effects of CrPIP1;5, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants that ectopically expressed CrPIP1;5 under the control of 35S promoters.;  Although our seed germinating assays indicated that CrPIP1;5 OX lines showed no significant difference on germination rates under salt, salt-alkaline, or high osmotic challenges compared with WT seeds (Figure S3), while in the seedling growth assays, CrPIP1;5 OX line seedlings showed slightly growth retardation on the salt and salt-alkaline MS plates compared with WT control (Figure S4).; The seeds of WT and CrPIP1;5 OX lines were grown in well-watered conditions for 30 days, and prior to the salt, drought, and alkaline stress treatments, the growth rates of adult plants (WT and three CrPIP1;5 OX lines) were relatively consistent.;  Apparently, CrPIP1;5 resulted in weak sensitivity to drought (Fig. 9a).;  After 10 days of water withdrawal, all plants wilted to some degree in both WT and the three CrPIP1;5 OX lines.;  After re-watering and growing for another 7 days, most of the CrPIP1;5 OX plants did not recover, while most of the WT plants did recover and had a higher survival rate than CrPIP1;5 OX plants (Fig. 9b).;  This result indicates that overexpression of CrPIP1;5 decreased plant resistance to drought.; Drought stress treatment on the growth of the transgenic CrPIP1;5 overexpression lines (OX 1#, OX 5#, and OX 10#) and wild-type (WT) plants under natural growth conditions in vermiculite. a Leaf phenotypes of the transgenic line and WT plants under drought treatment. b The survival rates of the OX lines and WT plants.; We found that GFP-fused CrPIP1;5 was constitutively expressed (under the control of CaMV 35S) in transgenic Arabidopsis plants.;  Root tip fluorescence of roughly three- to four-day-old transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings was easily discerned by confocal microscopy; the GFP-CrPIP1;5 protein was visible in the plasma membranes of transgenic plants, while in control plant roots, the GFP signal was distributed evenly in the whole cytoplasm (Figure S6).;  These results suggest that subcellular localization of CrPIP1;5 was consistent across the PIP1 subfamily and was predominantly localized to the plasma membrane, as well as partly in endomembrane system.;  Within the plasma membrane, CrPIP1;5 was folded into a specific transmembrane channel and functioned as a water transporter.;  Two AQP genes from G. soja, GsTIP2;1 and GsPIP2;1, minimized tolerance to salt and dehydration stress when overexpressed in Arabidopsis, implying they have negative impacts on stress tolerance by regulating water potential [43, 44]. In most functional analyses conducted in transgenic plants, the overexpression of AQP genes caused elevated tolerance to salt and drought, such as in Malus zumi (gene MzPIP2;1) [45], Sesuvium portulacastrum (SpAQP1) [46], Stipa purpurea (SpPIP1) [47], Simmondsia chinensis (ScPIP1) [48], Thellungiella salsuginea (TsPIP1;1) [49], and Phoenix dactylifera (PdPIP1;2) [50]. The elevated expression of AQP genes in plants can lead to cellular changes in water potential, which cause alterations in water uptake and transpiration, and ultimately modify tolerance to water deficit stress.; In our previous research, we have characterized CrPIP2;3 as a salt/drought stress related gene [36]. Here we performed protein–protein interaction studies using yeast two-hybrid assays and found that two CrPIP members, encoded by CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3, that were highly expressed in all tested tissues and almost constitutively expressed under the abiotic stress challenges and ABA treatment (Figs. 5a and ​and6).6).;  This is consistent with previous findings that some PIP1 and PIP2 members could assemble as homotetramers and heterotetramers, thereby triggering channel activities, influencing substrate specificity, and regulating PIP trafficking [56]. Here, our results on the expression patterns of CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 provide a detailed understanding of their regulatory modes and help to illuminate CrAQP functions.; Our results from the yeast overexpression system indicate that CrPIP1;5 is an active transmembrane H2O and H2O2 transporter (Fig. 8).;  We assessed the overexpression of CrPIP1;5 in transgenic Arabidopsis, and CrPIP1;5 lead to slightly reduced saline-alkaline and drought tolerance, which showed the exact opposite phenotype compared with CrPIP2;3’s overexpression in Arabidopsis [36]. This also suggests that CrPIP1;5 could play a key role in water transport.;  Here we speculated that as a foreign AQP gene, CrPIP1;5 might be involved in modifying the function of endogenous PIPs of Arabidopsis, or function more in water flowing out than water absorption in transgenic Arabidopsis roots, thereby resulted in sensitivity to salt and drought stresses.;  We also found that high levels of salt, alkaline, and ABA slightly decreased the expression of CrPIP1;5 in C. rosea, this further suggests that this gene is highly important for water movement between cells and tissues, and is indeed involved in a stress response pathway that protects yeast cells or plants from water loss under high salinity conditions and promotes water release under high osmotic stress or drought (Figs. 8b and ​and9).9).;  The overexpression of CrPIP1;5 in transgenic Arabidopsis is in contrast to most previous findings [40, 54], suggesting that overexpression of plant PIPs results in specificities of abiotic stress tolerance or sensitivity, which also might be attributed to the protein interaction, post-translational modifications (PTM), protein trafficking of the foreign AQP.;  While in C. rosea, our results about the expression pattern of CrPIP1;5 regarding to different tissues or habitats (Fig. 5), as well as the transcriptional changes responding to salinity/alkaline, high osmotic stress, and ABA treatment (Fig. 6a), indicated that CrPIP1;5 might be boiled down to a “housekeeping gene” for basic water homeostasis, to some degree.;  Even the CrPIP1;5 showed higher expression level in YX sample than in SCBG sample (leaves) (Fig. 5b), which might be probably due to the long-term adaptive mechanism that C. rosea plants on YX island have to deal with much tougher water-deficit adversities than plants in SCBG, including water absorption from the external environment and water transportation in vivo.;  The slightly decreased expression of CrPIP1;5 in C. rosea seedlings caused by stress factors or ABA (Fig. 6a), which might be an emergency protection for alleviating the damages caused by water disturbances, since we only checked the CrPIP1;5’s expression changes in 24 h challenged by different factors.;  For example, tobacco PIP1 member, NtAQP1, caused a decline of root hydraulic conductivity and decreased resistance of plants to water stress [57]. Transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants overexpressing AtPIP1;4 and AtPIP2;5 displayed rapid water loss under dehydration stress and showed enhanced water flow under drought stress [58]. The Glycine soja gene GsPIP2;1 negatively impact salt and drought stress tolerance by regulating water potential when overexpressed in transgenic Arabidopsis [44]. In addition, Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AcPIP2 (a PIP gene from saltbush A. canescens) exhibited drought-sensitive phenotypes [41]. This can be explained by the nature and intensity of stresses, combining with the cooperation between the over-expressed foreign AQPs and the endogenous AQPs.;  In our study, the over-expression of CrPIP1;5 showed some sensitivity both in yeast and in Arabidopsis, which only reflect CrPIP1;5 did involve in water stress responses in vivo.;  Overall, as an active water channel protein with high expression levels in C. rosea different tissues or challenged by different factors, the CrPIP1;5, as well as the CrPIP2;3, might be basic sustainers for water homeostasis during the development of C. rosea plants.;  As predicted, the two PIP1 and PIP2 members, CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3, formed homodimers and heterodimers through protein interactions.;  We also functionally identified one of the CrPIP1 members, CrPIP1;5, given its highest expression levels in different tissues of C. rosea.;  Although our results showed that overexpression of CrPIP1;5 could increase sensitivity to saline-alkaline and drought conditions in yeast and plants, combining the high and regulatable expression of CrPIP1;5 in C. rosea, it can be inferred that CrPIP1;5 is one of basic and important functional genes for facilitating water transportation in vivo, and might be involved in the C. rosea ecological adaptation to tropical coral reef.; The full-length cDNAs of CrPIP1;5 (GenBank accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MT787665"",""term_id"":""2063684758""}}MT787665) and CrPIP2;3 (GenBank accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MT787666"",""term_id"":""2063684760""}}MT787666) were isolated from the cDNA library of C. rosea seedlings, in which all cDNAs were inserted into a yeast expression vector (pYES-DEST52) using Gateway® techniques (Life Technologies).;  The recombinant plasmids containing CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 cDNAs were designated as CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 and CrPIP2;3-pYES-DEST52 and used as template DNA in the following PCR assays.;  The open reading frame (ORF) regions of CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 were PCR-amplified using the primer pairs PIP1-5BDF/PIP1-5BDR and PIP2-3BDF/PIP2-3BDR, respectively (Table S2), and then inserted into a pGBKT7 vector using InFusion® techniques (In-Fusion HD® Cloning System, Clontech) to construct the pGBKT7-CrPIP1;5 and pGBKT7-CrPIP2;3 bait plasmids.;  The prey plasmid, pGADT7-CrPIP1;5, and pGADT7-CrPIP2;3, were generated by cloning the CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 ORFs into the pGADT7 vector after amplification (using the primers PIP1-5ADF/PIP1-5ADR, PIP2-3ADF/PIP2-3ADR as above; Table S2).; The recombinant plasmids CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 and the empty vector pYES2 (a negative control) were transformed into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild type strains W303 (MATa; his3-11_15; leu2-3_112; ura3-1; trp1Δ2; ade2-1; can1-100), WT (BY47471; MATa; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0), and H2O2-sensitive mutant skn7Δ (BY4741; MATa; ura3Δ0; leu2Δ0; his3Δ1; met15Δ0; YHR206w::kanMX4).; The coding sequence (CDS) of the CrPIP1;5 cDNA was PCR-amplified using the primer pair PIP1-5OXGF/PIP1-5OXGR (Table S2) and then inserted into plant expression vector pEGAD to generate CrPIP1;5-pEGAD.;  These tests were thereby meant to evaluate the biological functions of CrPIP1;5.; In brief, seed germination rate of the CrPIP1;5 transgenic Arabidopsis (OX 1#, OX 5#, OX 10#, and WT) was measured under the following stress treatments: NaCl (175 mM, 200 mM, and 225 mM; salt stress); 5 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 95 mmol/L NaCl (pH 8.2), 7.5 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 92.5 mmol/L NaCl (pH 8.2), and 10 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 90 mmol/L NaCl (pH 8.2; alkaline stress); mannitol (200 mM, 300 mM, and 400 mM) stress.;  The goal of these treatments was to detect the effect of the overexpression of CrPIP1;5 on affecting the salt/alkaline/osmotic tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis seeds during germination.;  Additionally, root length was calculated to evaluate the influence of the overexpression of CrPIP1;5 on transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings under abiotic stress (100 mM, 150 mM, and 200 mM NaCl for salt stress; 0.5 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 99.5 mmol/L NaCl, 0.75 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 99.25 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 99 mmol/L NaCl, pH 8.2 for alkaline stress; 200 mM, 300 mM, and 400 mM mannitol for osmotic stress.; Subcellular localization of CrPIP1;5 in Arabidopsis was also detected using GFP fusion protein in seedling roots.;  The OX homozygous lines of CrPIP1;5-pEGAD and the control (pEGAD) transgenic plants were sterilized and spotted in MS plates to generate seedlings.",PIP1,abiotic stress,,down
36250323,9672858," Nevertheless, Alcolapia retain the Rhesus glycoprotein genes in their genomes and using two heterologous expression systems, we demonstrate that Alcolapia Rhbg is capable of moving ammonia.;  Using in situ hybridisation, we demonstrate robust, localised gene expression of Rhbg, rhcg1 and rhcg2 in the gill tissue in both A. alcalica embryos and adults, similar to that in other ammoniotelic fish.;  Rhag is present in the membrane of red blood cells, while Rhbg, Rhcg1 and Rhcg2 are predominantly detected in gill tissue (Nakada et al., 2007a,b; Wright and Wood, 2009).;  Immunohistochemistry in pufferfish gills has shown that Rhbg is present on the basolateral membrane while Rhcg2 is on the apical membrane of pavement cells; this arrangement may allow the proteins to work together to transport ammonia across gill tissues into the surrounding water (Nakada et al., 2007a,b).;  While this organisation of Rh proteins has been described in the fish gill, the expression of Rhbg in larval skin during early development, in the absence of Rhcg2, suggests that the collaboration of these two Rh proteins is not always required for ammonia transport (Braun et al., 2009), although Rhcg1 could fill this role (Shih et al., 2013).;  Selective knockdown using morpholinos against Rhag, Rhbg and Rhcg1 in developing D. rerio resulted in around a 50% reduction in ammonia excretion, regardless of the Rh targeted.;  In contrast, a recent paper showed that knock-down of rhcg(b) (also known as rhcg1; Nakada et al., 2007a) in D. rerio did not affect ammonia excretion in larva, which suggests that there are compensatory mechanisms upregulating the expression of other rhesus protein genes such as Rhbg (Zimmer and Perry, 2020).; The presence of Rhbg and Rhcg2 transcripts in Alcolapia gill tissue is surprising since these fish are thought to excrete all nitrogenous waste as urea, as has been reported for A. grahami (Randall et al., 1989; Wood et al., 2013).;  Interestingly, the expression of Rhbg and Rhcg2 has been detected in liver, muscle and intestinal tissue (as well as the gills) of these fishes (Wood et al., 2013), suggesting that Rh proteins could be used to shuttle ammonia into tissues with known ornithine-urea cycle activity (Lindley et al., 1999; White et al., 2020).;  It has been suggested that Alcolapia Rhbg and Rhcg2 are structurally different from their orthologues in other species, with 10 rather than 12 transmembrane domains (Wood et al., 2013), raising the possibility that Alcolapia Rh proteins transport another compound or are acting to channel ammonia to tissues for conversion to urea rather than excreting ammonia directly.; Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence of the Rh proteins confirm that Alcolapia Rh proteins are orthologous to those in other species included in the analysis, grouping with genes coding for Rhag, Rhbg, Rhcg1, and Rhcg2 (Fig. 1A).;  Analysis of gene synteny (Fig. 1B) in D. rerio and O. niloticus shows that the approximate position with respect to neighbouring genes and the orientation of rhesus protein genes Rhbg, Rhcg1 and Rhcg2 is conserved between O. niloticus and D. rerio.;  Both Rhbg and Rhcg2 show significantly elevated dN/dS ratios in the Alcolapia lineage when compared to non-Alcolapia cichlids (orange dots) but not compared to other Alcolapia species (blue dots) (Table S1).; Testing for variation in ratio of the rates of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) for the four Rh proteins among branches of the phylogeny demonstrates that while Rhag and Rhcg1 are under purifying selection, both Rhbg and Rhcg2 have evolved under positive selection in the lineage leading to Alcolapia (Fig. 1C and Table S1).​ This is shown by the comparison of Alcolapian Rhbg and Rhcg2 to the same genes from non-Alcolapian cichlids, as highlighted by the increased dN/dS ration for that comparison in Fig. 1C.; A computationally derived model of the A. alcalica Rhbg protein displays a 12 transmembrane helices structure with a long C-terminal tail; the tail is a feature known to be highly variable within the Amt/Mep/Rh family and has been posited to facilitate a protein–protein interaction in one member from Nitrosomonas europaea (Li et al., 2007; Lupo et al., 2007) (Fig. 2A).;  The model of A. alcalica Rhbg displays high confidence across most of its sequence, with the notable exception of the C-tail, which is to be expected given its divergent sequence across the Rh family.;  The 12 transmembrane helices and other key features of rhesus proteins are conserved, including the characteristic twin-His motif that is situated within the hydrophobic channel of Rhbg, and has been shown in AmtB to be critical for transport function and selectivity (Williamson et al., 2020) (Fig. 2B).;  The extracellular side of A. alcalica Rhbg contains the highly negatively charged surface characteristic of the Rh family (Fig. 2C).;  The structural features predicted by this modelling are consistent with A. alcalica Rhbg acting as an ammonia transporter which we went on to test using two heterologous expression systems.;  The predicted protein structure of A. alcalica Rhbg monomer was generated using AlphaFold as detailed in Jumper et al., 2021. (A) Three dimensional model of Alcolapia Rhbg reveals 12 transmembrane helices and a long C-terminal tail.; To determine whether A. alcalica rhesus proteins are able to move ammonium in vivo, synthetic mRNA coding for A. alcalica Rhbg was injected into zebrafish embryos and ammonia excretion was measured after 24 h.;  Injection of mRNA coding for Rhbg from the ammonotelic D. rerio was also analysed for comparison.;  Analysis of nitrogenous waste produced by injected and uninjected control embryos shows that overexpression of A. alcalica Rhbg significantly increases the amount ammonia detected in holding water, while the small increase resulting from overexpressing D. rerio Rhbg is not statistically significant (Fig. 3A).;  These data suggest that the Alcolapia Rhbg protein is functional and, like Rhbg proteins in ammoniotelic species, has the capacity to transport ammonium.; Alcolapia Rhbg can transport ammonium. (A) µM of nitrogen as ammonia and (B) µM of nitrogen as urea, compared to wildtype.;  Ammonia and urea concentration represented as µM of nitrogen are shown for control embryos, embryos injected with 150pg of mRNA coding for D. rerio Rhbg or A. alcalica Rhbg (P-value *<0.05, ns: not significant). (C) Saccharomyces cerevisiae growth on minimal media (pH 6.1) containing NH4 as a sole nitrogen source was measured for 40 h.; To further examine the biological activity of Rhbg proteins from Alcolapia and D. rerio, expression plasmids were generated such that A. alcalica Rhbg and D. rerio Rhbg were constitutively expressed in a S. cerevisiae strain lacking its endogenous Mep ammonium transporters.;  In this assay, the Rhbg proteins are tested for their ability to complement the growth defect displayed by the mutant strain in a limited ammonium environment, which would indicate ammonium transport activity (Marini et al., 1997).;  Fig. 3C shows that at 1 mM NH4+ the expression of Rhbg, from both A. alcalica and D. rerio, facilitated growth.;  Transcripts for the genes coding for Rhbg and Rhcg2 have been detected in A. grahami, as has protein expression in the gill filaments (Wood et al., 2013).;  A. alcalica embryos show a restricted expression domain where Rhbg (Fig. 5A,B), rhcg1 (Fig. 5D,E), and rhcg2 (Fig. 5G,H) are detected only in gill tissue (arrows).;  Rhbg has the strongest expression in both developing embryos (Fig. 5A,B) and adult gill tissue (Fig. 5C).;  In adults, Rhbg is detected solely in the pavement cells of the gill filaments.;  Rhcg2 is found in the same region of the gill as Rhbg although expressed at a lower level (Fig. 5I).; In situ hybridisation of Rhesus glycoproteins (Rh) in A. alcalica embryos at 5 dpf and adult gills.

(H) Rhcg2 expression, ventral view of the head. (I) Rhcg2 expression in adult gills.;  In situ hybridisation was carried out using DIG-labelled antisense probes to detect mRNAs Rhbg, Rhcg1 and Rhcg2.;  Fig. 6A-C shows robust expression of Rhbg (Fig. 6A), Rhcg1 (Fig. 6B), and Rhcg2 (Fig. 6C) in gills of A. alcalica detected after 16 h in substrate.;  Fig. 6D-F shows the corresponding low-level expression of Rhbg (Fig. 6D), Rhcg1 (Fig. 6E), and Rhcg2 (Fig. 6F) in gills of A. grahami analysed in parallel, alongside A. alcalica and photographed after the same period of time.;  For both species, expression is apparent in the same regions: Rhbg and Rhcg2 in the gill filaments, and Rhcg1 in the mitochondria rich cells; but the expression appears much weaker in A. grahami.;  We conclude that A. grahami remains 100% ureotelic due to low expression of Rhbg, Rhcg1 and Rhcg2; while the high expression of these functional rhesus glycoprotein genes in A.alcalica allows it to excrete a portion of its waste as ammonia.;  This observation is consistent with the robust expression of functional ammonium transporters, including Rhbg, in A. alcalica.;  We show that A. alcalica Rhbg (as well as Rhcg1 and Rhcg2) are expressed in the gill in both A. alcalica embryos and adults and that Alcolapia Rhbg protein is capable of moving ammonium in two heterologous expression systems, zebrafish embryos and a yeast growth assay.;  The Rhbg protein sequence is almost identical in these two species, suggesting that at the biochemical level A. grahami has the means/tools to move ammonia, but does not, even under temperate environmental conditions.;  Even after generations in non-extreme conditions, there is no recovery of Rhbg/cg expression in A. grahami and they remain fully ureotelic.;  Nevertheless, these expression data point to Alcolapia Rhbg, rhcg1 and rhcg2 as orthologues to those of other fishes.; Like other members of the Rh family, and unlike the Amt family, no defined NH4+ binding site is present in A. alcalica Rhbg.;  The model of A. alcalica Rhbg presented in this report strongly supports a protein that functions as a typical Rh protein.;  It is surprising that when overexpressed in zebrafish embryos, Danio Rhbg did not significantly increase excreted ammonia while Alcolapia Rhbg did.; Given the near identical sequence of Rhbg in A. alcalica and A. grahami (99.5%; see Fig.;  S4) it can be expected that A. grahami Rhbg also forms a functional ammonia transporter, aligning with previous work showing that Rh proteins facilitate ammonia excretion under high environmental ammonia (HEA) exposure based on the response of A. grahami Rhbg at both the mRNA and protein level in the gills under HEA stress (Wood et al., 2013).;  Whether this precise mechanism also occurs in the Rh family is unknown, but a multiple sequence alignment of A. alcalica rhesus proteins and D. rerio Rhbg with E. coli AmtB shows conservation of key ammonium transport residues.; The evidence presented here indicates that Alcolapia Rhbg protein is capable of transporting ammonia; this is consistent with our finding that A. alcalica excrete a proportion of their nitrogenous waste as ammonia.;  Full-length cDNAs coding for Rhbg proteins were cloned into the expression plasmid pCS2+ and sequenced. mRNA for injections was synthesised using messageMACHINE® SP6 kit as per manufacturer's instructions.; Since A. alcalica Rhbg appears to have evolved under positive selection, we used AlphaFold to predict the extent to which whether the amino acid changes may have altered its structure and its ability to transport ammonia.;  The AlphaFold model of A. alcalica Rhbg was calculated using the protein sequence of Rhbg from A. alcalica (accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MW448158"",""term_id"":""1997175937"",""term_text"":""MW448158""}}MW448158) on the AlphaFold Google Colab platform (Jumper et al., 2021).;  Gene specific primers (Table S2) were designed to amplify Alcolapia Rhbg, Rhcg1, Rhcg2, and eF1ɑ. The nucleotides sequences in these regions are identical in A. alcalica and A. grahami so the same primers and PCR conditions were used (22 cycles).;  To test the activity of Alcolapia Rhbg in moving ammonia we included uninjected embryos and embryos where Rhbg had been overexpressed by injection of synthetic mRNA from either Danio or A. alcalica.;  The concentration of nitrogen as ammonia and urea for the three treatments (uninjected, Danio Rhbg, Alcolapia Rhbg) were measured and compared using two-sample t-tests.; In order to test the ability of the A. alcalica rhesus protein genes to move ammonium in yeast, the Rhbg genes from A. alcalica and D. rerio were cloned into the vector pDR195 by homologous recombination and transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae 31019b (MATα ura3 mep1Δ mep2Δ::Leu2 mep3Δ::KanMX2), a yeast mutant with deletions in the three endogenous ammonium-transporter genes and defective in ammonium transport.",Rhbg,genus Alcolapia,,down
36250323,9672858," Nevertheless, Alcolapia retain the Rhesus glycoprotein genes in their genomes and using two heterologous expression systems, we demonstrate that Alcolapia Rhbg is capable of moving ammonia.;  Using in situ hybridisation, we demonstrate robust, localised gene expression of Rhbg, rhcg1 and rhcg2 in the gill tissue in both A. alcalica embryos and adults, similar to that in other ammoniotelic fish.;  Rhag is present in the membrane of red blood cells, while Rhbg, Rhcg1 and Rhcg2 are predominantly detected in gill tissue (Nakada et al., 2007a,b; Wright and Wood, 2009).;  Immunohistochemistry in pufferfish gills has shown that Rhbg is present on the basolateral membrane while Rhcg2 is on the apical membrane of pavement cells; this arrangement may allow the proteins to work together to transport ammonia across gill tissues into the surrounding water (Nakada et al., 2007a,b).;  While this organisation of Rh proteins has been described in the fish gill, the expression of Rhbg in larval skin during early development, in the absence of Rhcg2, suggests that the collaboration of these two Rh proteins is not always required for ammonia transport (Braun et al., 2009), although Rhcg1 could fill this role (Shih et al., 2013).;  Selective knockdown using morpholinos against Rhag, Rhbg and Rhcg1 in developing D. rerio resulted in around a 50% reduction in ammonia excretion, regardless of the Rh targeted.;  In contrast, a recent paper showed that knock-down of rhcg(b) (also known as rhcg1; Nakada et al., 2007a) in D. rerio did not affect ammonia excretion in larva, which suggests that there are compensatory mechanisms upregulating the expression of other rhesus protein genes such as Rhbg (Zimmer and Perry, 2020).; The presence of Rhbg and Rhcg2 transcripts in Alcolapia gill tissue is surprising since these fish are thought to excrete all nitrogenous waste as urea, as has been reported for A. grahami (Randall et al., 1989; Wood et al., 2013).;  Interestingly, the expression of Rhbg and Rhcg2 has been detected in liver, muscle and intestinal tissue (as well as the gills) of these fishes (Wood et al., 2013), suggesting that Rh proteins could be used to shuttle ammonia into tissues with known ornithine-urea cycle activity (Lindley et al., 1999; White et al., 2020).;  It has been suggested that Alcolapia Rhbg and Rhcg2 are structurally different from their orthologues in other species, with 10 rather than 12 transmembrane domains (Wood et al., 2013), raising the possibility that Alcolapia Rh proteins transport another compound or are acting to channel ammonia to tissues for conversion to urea rather than excreting ammonia directly.; Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence of the Rh proteins confirm that Alcolapia Rh proteins are orthologous to those in other species included in the analysis, grouping with genes coding for Rhag, Rhbg, Rhcg1, and Rhcg2 (Fig. 1A).;  Analysis of gene synteny (Fig. 1B) in D. rerio and O. niloticus shows that the approximate position with respect to neighbouring genes and the orientation of rhesus protein genes Rhbg, Rhcg1 and Rhcg2 is conserved between O. niloticus and D. rerio.;  Both Rhbg and Rhcg2 show significantly elevated dN/dS ratios in the Alcolapia lineage when compared to non-Alcolapia cichlids (orange dots) but not compared to other Alcolapia species (blue dots) (Table S1).; Testing for variation in ratio of the rates of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) for the four Rh proteins among branches of the phylogeny demonstrates that while Rhag and Rhcg1 are under purifying selection, both Rhbg and Rhcg2 have evolved under positive selection in the lineage leading to Alcolapia (Fig. 1C and Table S1).​ This is shown by the comparison of Alcolapian Rhbg and Rhcg2 to the same genes from non-Alcolapian cichlids, as highlighted by the increased dN/dS ration for that comparison in Fig. 1C.;

(I) Rhcg2 expression in adult gills.;  In situ hybridisation was carried out using DIG-labelled antisense probes to detect mRNAs Rhbg, Rhcg1 and Rhcg2.;  Fig. 6A-C shows robust expression of Rhbg (Fig. 6A), Rhcg1 (Fig. 6B), and Rhcg2 (Fig. 6C) in gills of A. alcalica detected after 16 h in substrate.;  Fig. 6D-F shows the corresponding low-level expression of Rhbg (Fig. 6D), Rhcg1 (Fig. 6E), and Rhcg2 (Fig. 6F) in gills of A. grahami analysed in parallel, alongside A. alcalica and photographed after the same period of time.;  For both species, expression is apparent in the same regions: Rhbg and Rhcg2 in the gill filaments, and Rhcg1 in the mitochondria rich cells; but the expression appears much weaker in A. grahami.;  We conclude that A. grahami remains 100% ureotelic due to low expression of Rhbg, Rhcg1 and Rhcg2; while the high expression of these functional rhesus glycoprotein genes in A.alcalica allows it to excrete a portion of its waste as ammonia.;  This observation is consistent with the robust expression of functional ammonium transporters, including Rhbg, in A. alcalica.;  We show that A. alcalica Rhbg (as well as Rhcg1 and Rhcg2) are expressed in the gill in both A. alcalica embryos and adults and that Alcolapia Rhbg protein is capable of moving ammonium in two heterologous expression systems, zebrafish embryos and a yeast growth assay.;  The Rhbg protein sequence is almost identical in these two species, suggesting that at the biochemical level A. grahami has the means/tools to move ammonia, but does not, even under temperate environmental conditions.;  Even after generations in non-extreme conditions, there is no recovery of Rhbg/cg expression in A. grahami and they remain fully ureotelic.;  Nevertheless, these expression data point to Alcolapia Rhbg, rhcg1 and rhcg2 as orthologues to those of other fishes.; Like other members of the Rh family, and unlike the Amt family, no defined NH4+ binding site is present in A. alcalica Rhbg.;  The model of A. alcalica Rhbg presented in this report strongly supports a protein that functions as a typical Rh protein.;  It is surprising that when overexpressed in zebrafish embryos, Danio Rhbg did not significantly increase excreted ammonia while Alcolapia Rhbg did.; Given the near identical sequence of Rhbg in A. alcalica and A. grahami (99.5%; see Fig.;  S4) it can be expected that A. grahami Rhbg also forms a functional ammonia transporter, aligning with previous work showing that Rh proteins facilitate ammonia excretion under high environmental ammonia (HEA) exposure based on the response of A. grahami Rhbg at both the mRNA and protein level in the gills under HEA stress (Wood et al., 2013).;  Whether this precise mechanism also occurs in the Rh family is unknown, but a multiple sequence alignment of A. alcalica rhesus proteins and D. rerio Rhbg with E. coli AmtB shows conservation of key ammonium transport residues.; The evidence presented here indicates that Alcolapia Rhbg protein is capable of transporting ammonia; this is consistent with our finding that A. alcalica excrete a proportion of their nitrogenous waste as ammonia.;  Full-length cDNAs coding for Rhbg proteins were cloned into the expression plasmid pCS2+ and sequenced. mRNA for injections was synthesised using messageMACHINE® SP6 kit as per manufacturer's instructions.; Since A. alcalica Rhbg appears to have evolved under positive selection, we used AlphaFold to predict the extent to which whether the amino acid changes may have altered its structure and its ability to transport ammonia.;  The AlphaFold model of A. alcalica Rhbg was calculated using the protein sequence of Rhbg from A. alcalica (accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MW448158"",""term_id"":""1997175937"",""term_text"":""MW448158""}}MW448158) on the AlphaFold Google Colab platform (Jumper et al., 2021).;  Gene specific primers (Table S2) were designed to amplify Alcolapia Rhbg, Rhcg1, Rhcg2, and eF1ɑ. The nucleotides sequences in these regions are identical in A. alcalica and A. grahami so the same primers and PCR conditions were used (22 cycles).;  To test the activity of Alcolapia Rhbg in moving ammonia we included uninjected embryos and embryos where Rhbg had been overexpressed by injection of synthetic mRNA from either Danio or A. alcalica.;  The concentration of nitrogen as ammonia and urea for the three treatments (uninjected, Danio Rhbg, Alcolapia Rhbg) were measured and compared using two-sample t-tests.; In order to test the ability of the A. alcalica rhesus protein genes to move ammonium in yeast, the Rhbg genes from A. alcalica and D. rerio were cloned into the vector pDR195 by homologous recombination and transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae 31019b (MATα ura3 mep1Δ mep2Δ::Leu2 mep3Δ::KanMX2), a yeast mutant with deletions in the three endogenous ammonium-transporter genes and defective in ammonium transport.",Rhbg, Alcolapia alcalica excretes,,down
30400922,6220464," Furthermore, histomorphometric and histological profile analyses of serum biochemical parameters (osteocalcin content and bone specific alkaline phosphatase [bALP] activity) were conducted following sacrifice.;  Mouse Osteocalcin ELIZA Kit and Mouse bALP ELIZA Kit, purchased from MyBioSource (CA, USA), were used for measuring the serum osteocalcin and bALP levels, respectively.; OVX control groups displayed a significant (p < 0.01) decline in serum bALP activity and a noteworthy rise in serum osteocalcin.;  However, all formulations of EAP and TM significantly (p < 0.01) reduced the serum osteocalcin levels and significantly (p < 0.01) increased the bALP activity.;  Particularly, EAP:TM (3:1) treated mice revealed significant (p < 0.01; p < 0.05) decreases in serum osteocalcin content and increases in serum bALP activity.;  RES (2.5 mg/kg) supplied OVX mice also showed significantly (p < 0.01) decreases in serum osteocalcin levels; yet, both groups demonstrated similar serum bALP activity compared to the OVX control group (Figs. 2 and ​and3;3; Additional file 3).; Serum osteocalcin levels in sham-operated and OVX mice.; OVX mice showed noticeable increases in body weight, weight gain, and serum osteocalcin levels, as well as decreases in serum bALP activity, femur wet, dry, and ash weights, femur Ca and IP contents, BMD, and strength as compared to sham vehical control.;  Despite these issues, serum bALP and osteocalcin levels are normally considered as acceptable indicators of bone formation and turnover, respectively [7, 9, 60–62]. In this study, OVX-control groups showed a significant decrease in serum bALP activity and a significant increase in serum osteocalcin levels as compared with the sham-control groups.;  However, all EAP:TM single or mixed formulations and especially, mice treated with EAP:TM 3:1-formualtion showed increases in serum bALP activity and decreases in osteocalcin levels.;  Moreover, RES 2.5 mg/kg significantly decreased serum osteocalcin levels, but had no effect on serum bALP activity.; Raw data on serum osteocalcin and bALP levels in sham-operated and OVX mice.",osteocalcin,osteoporosis,,up
