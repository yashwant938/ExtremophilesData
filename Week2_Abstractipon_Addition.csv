Alkalinicity presents a challenge for life due to a ""reversed"" proton gradient 
that is unfavourable to many bioenergetic processes across the membranes of 
microorganisms. Despite this, many bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, 
collectively termed alkaliphiles, are adapted to life in alkaline ecosystems and 
are of great scientific and biotechnological interest due to their niche 
specialization and ability to produce highly stable enzymes. Advances in 
next-generation sequencing technologies have propelled not only the genomic 
characterization of many alkaliphilic microorganisms that have been isolated 
from nature alkaline sources but also our understanding of the functional 
relationships between different taxa in microbial communities living in these 
ecosystems. In this review, we discuss the genetics and molecular biology of 
alkaliphiles from an ""omics"" point of view, focusing on how metagenomics and 
transcriptomics have contributed to our understanding of these extremophiles.

Cryopreservation of cells and biologics underpins all biomedical research from 
routine sample storage to emerging cell-based therapies, as well as ensuring 
cell banks provide authenticated, stable and consistent cell products. This 
field began with the discovery and wide adoption of glycerol and dimethyl 
sulfoxide as cryoprotectants over 60 years ago, but these tools do not work for 
all cells and are not ideal for all workflows. In this Review, we highlight and 
critically review the approaches to discover, and apply, new chemical tools for 
cryopreservation. We summarize the key (and complex) damage pathways during 
cellular cryopreservation and how each can be addressed. Bio-inspired 
approaches, such as those based on extremophiles, are also discussed. We 
describe both small-molecule-based and macromolecular-based strategies, 
including ice binders, ice nucleators, ice nucleation inhibitors and emerging 
materials whose exact mechanism has yet to be understood. Finally, looking 
towards the future of the field, the application of bottom-up molecular 
modelling, library-based discovery approaches and materials science tools, which 
are set to transform cryopreservation strategies, are also included.

Alkalithermophiles are an exciting subset of extremophilic organisms and 
represent extremophiles that are adapted to two extreme conditions, i.e. to a 
combination of alkaline and thermobiotic growth conditions. Among the anaerobic 
alkalithermophiles are representatives of both Bacteria and Archaea within a 
wide variety of physiological types and systematic groups, although a great 
majority belongs to the Firmicutes. Alkaliphiles have been isolated from a 
variety of niches including mesobiotic and neutrophilic soils and sediments. 
Interestingly anaerobic isolates from mesobiotic and neutrophilic niches exhibit 
shorter doubling times than isolates from thermobiotic niches; some anaerobic 
alkalithermophiles exhibit extremely fast growth rates, i.e. doubling times as 
short as 10 min. Their adaptation to both high pH and high temperature draws our 
attention not only because they are potential sources of industrially valuable 
enzymes but also because of their adaptive mechanisms to external environmental 
parameters. They could thus function as model organisms for extraterrestrial 
life in some environments and for theories on the origin of life. 
Alkalithermophiles, as far we know, do not represent the most thermophilic nor 
the most alkaliphilic of micro-organisms but represent the most alkaliphilic 
ones among the thermophiles and vice versa. We believe that the presently known 
species are only the tip of the iceberg and therefore that they do not represent 
the true boundaries under which life can thrive in respect to high temperature 
in alkaline environments.

Hot springs are considered to be a unique environment with extremophiles, that 
are sources of industrially important enzymes, and other biotechnological 
products. The objective of this study was to undertake, analyze, and 
characterize the microbiome of two major hot springs located in the state of 
Madhya Pradesh explicitly, Chhoti Anhoni (Hotspring 1), and Badi Anhoni 
(Hotspring 2) to find out the inhabitant microbial population, and their 
functional characteristics. The taxonomic analysis of the microbiome of the hot 
springs revealed the phylum Proteobacteria was the most abundant taxa in both 
the hot-springs, however, its abundance in hot-spring 1 (~88%) was more than the 
hot-spring 2 (~52%). The phylum Bacteroides (~10-22%) was found to be the second 
most abundant group in the hot-springs followed by Spirocheates (~2-11%), 
Firmicutes (~6-8%), Chloroflexi (1-5%), etc. The functional analysis of the 
microbiome revealed different features related to several functions including 
metabolism of organics and degradation of xenobiotic compounds. The functional 
analysis showed that most of the attributes of the microbiome was related to 
metabolism, followed by cellular processes and environmental information 
processing functions. The functional annotation of the microbiomes at KEGG level 
3 annotated the sequences into 279 active features that showed variation in 
abundance between the hot spring samples, where hot-spring 1 was functionally 
more diverse. Interestingly, the abundance of functional genes from methanogenic 
bacteria, was higher in the hot-spring 2, which may be related to the relatively 
higher pH and temperature than Hotspring 1. The study showed the presence of 
different unassigned bacterial taxa with high abundance which indicates the 
potential of novel genera or phylotypes. Culturable isolates (28) were 
bio-prospected for industrially important enzymes including amylase, protease, 
lipase, gelatinase, pectinase, cellulase, lecithinase, and xylanase. Seven 
isolates (25%) had shown positive results for all the enzyme activities whereas 
23 isolates (82%) produced Protease, 27 isolates (96%) produced lipase, 27 
isolates produced amylase, 26 isolates (92%) produced cellulase, 19 isolates 
(67%) produced pectinase, 19 isolates (67%) could produce lecithinase, and 13 
isolates (46%) produced gelatinase. The seven isolates, positive for all the 
enzymes were analyzed further for quantitative analysis and identified through 
molecular characterization.

Phospholipids are major components of the cellular membranes present in all 
living organisms. They typically form a lipid bilayer that embroiders the cell 
or cellular organelles, constitute a barrier for ions and small solutes and form 
a matrix that supports the function of membrane proteins. The chemical 
composition of the membrane phospholipids present in the two prokaryotic domains 
Archaea and Bacteria are vastly different. Archaeal lipids are composed of 
highly-methylated isoprenoid chains that are ether-linked to a 
glycerol-1-phosphate backbone while bacterial phospholipids consist of straight 
fatty acids bound by ester bonds to the enantiomeric glycerol-3-phosphate 
backbone. The chemical structure of the archaeal lipids and their compositional 
diversity ensures the required stability at extreme environmental conditions as 
many archaea thrive at such conditions including high or low temperature, high 
salinity and extreme acidic or alkaline pH values. However, not all archaea are 
extremophiles, and the presence of ether-linked phospholipids is a phylogenetic 
marker that distinguishes Archaea from other life forms. During the past decade, 
our understanding of the biosynthesis of archaeal lipids has progressed 
resulting in the characterization of the main biosynthetic steps of the pathway 
including the reconstitution of lipid biosynthesis in vitro. Here we describe 
the chemical and physical properties of archaeal lipids and membranes derived 
thereof, summarize the existing knowledge about the enzymology of the archaeal 
lipid biosynthetic pathway and discuss evolutionary theories associated with the 
""Lipid Divide"" that resulted in the differentiation of bacterial and archaeal 
organisms. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Bacterial Lipids

Most research on microorganisms adapted to hypersaline habitats has focused on 
Archaea and Bacteria, with microbial eukaryotes receiving much less attention. 
Over the past 15 yr, our knowledge of phagotrophic microbial eukaryotes, i.e. 
protozoa, from hypersaline habitats has greatly improved through combinations of 
microscopy, molecular phylogenetics, environmental sequencing, transcriptomics 
and growth experiments. High salinity waters from salterns, other landlocked 
water masses and deep hypersaline anoxic basins contain unique and diverse 
halophilic protozoan assemblages. These have the potential to exert substantial 
grazing pressure on prokaryotes and other eukaryotes. They represent many 
separate evolutionary lineages; species of Heterolobosea, Bicosoecida, and 
Ciliophora have been most intensively characterized, with several proven to be 
extreme (or borderline extreme) halophiles. Transcriptomic examinations of the 
bicosoecid Halocafeteria (and the heteroloboseid Pharyngomonas) indicate that 
high-salt adaptation is associated with a subtle shift in protein amino acid 
composition, and involves the differential expression of genes participating in 
ion homeostasis, signal transduction, stress management, and lipid remodeling. 
Instances of gene duplication and lateral transfer possibly conferring 
adaptation have been documented. Indirect evidence suggests that these protozoa 
use ""salt-out"" osmoadaptive strategies.

Microorganisms that inhabit the extreme pH environments are classified as 
acidophiles and alkaliphiles. A number of studies emerged from extreme high (hot 
springs, hydrothermal vents) as well as low temperature (arctic and antarctic 
regions, sea water, ice shelf, marine sediments, cold deserts, glaciers, 
temperate forests, and plantations) environments have highlighted the occurrence 
of microorganisms (thermophiles/psychrophiles) with the ability to tolerate wide 
pH range, from acidic to alkaline (1.5-14.0 in some cases), under laboratory 
conditions. However, the sampling source (soil/sediment) of these microorganisms 
showed the pH to be neutral or slightly acidic/alkaline. The aim of the present 
review is to discuss the phenomenon of wide pH range tolerance possessed by 
these microorganisms as a hidden character in perspective of their habitats, 
possible mechanisms, phylogeny, ecological and biotechnological relevance, and 
future perspectives. It is believed that the genome is a probable reservoir of 
the hidden variations. The extremophiles have the ability to adapt against the 
environmental change that is probably through the expression/regulation of the 
specific genes that were already present in the genome. The phenomenon is likely 
to have broad implications in biotechnology, including both environmental (such 
as bioremediation, biodegradation, and biocontrol), and industrial applications 
(as a source of novel extremozymes and many other useful bioactive compounds 
with wide pH range tolerance).

Soda saline-alkaline lands are significantly harmful to agriculture; thus, 
effective strategies to remediate such soil are urgently needed. Multiple 
negative factors exist in the community structure of saline-alkaline fields, 
among which the lack of fungal species diversity remains the most prominent 
problem. The haloalkaliphilic fungi are a unique group of extremophiles that 
grow optimally under conditions of extreme salinity and alkalinity; these fungi, 
which buffer salinity and alkalinity by absorbing and/or constraining salt ions, 
produce organic acids and/or macromolecules, secrete macromolecules such as 
cellulose degradation enzymes, and provide biomass that is beneficial for soil 
health. Considering that haloalkaliphilic fungi are a valuable genetic resource 
of resistance and degradation genes, these fungi are expected to be applied in 
biotechnology. Aspergillus glaucus exhibits high resistance to a variety of 
stressors and the ability to degrade crop straw; and it is a practical genetic 
tool that can be used to identify and validate genes involved in abiotic stress 
resistance and cellulose decomposition genes. This review will focus on the 
following aspects: isolation of extreme haloalkaliphilic fungi, fungal genes 
involved in salt and alkalinity resistance, macromolecule degrading enzymes, 
applications for genetic improvement of haloalkaliphilic fungi, and application 
of haloalkaliphilic fungi in saline-alkali soil mycoremediation.

There are few places on Earth that are truly aseptic. Even environments that we 
may consider 'extreme', such as glaciers, deserts, or hypersaline bodies of 
water (Figure 1), can harbour life. The organisms that thrive in such 
environments - mostly microbes - are often referred to as 'extremophiles'. 
However, what constitutes extreme is in the eye of the beholder. Extremophilic 
organisms are so adapted to their environment that they perceive extreme 
conditions as optimal for their growth and can sometimes even be stressed by 
what we perceive as moderate. Stress is therefore not an optimal criterion for 
defining what is extreme. Instead, extreme conditions can be seen as those in 
which the majority of species cannot grow or even survive.

The haloalkaliphilics are an important subset of extremophiles that grow in salt 
[upto 33% (wt/vol) NaCl] and alkaline pH (> 9). They are found in hypersaline 
environments especially in the brines in arid, coastal and deep sea locations, 
and in alkaline environments, such as soda soils, lakes and deserts. Some 
authors have described haloalkaliphilic bacteria as moderate halophilic 
bacteria, but the molecular and classical studies revealed that they belong to 
moderately to extremely halophilic bacteria and archaea. Organic solutes, such 
as glycine, betaine and other amino acid derivatives, sugars such as, sucrose 
and trehalose, and sugar alcohols present in the haloalkaliphilics help for 
their osmoadaptation, and also serve as stabilizers. Haloalkalphilics secrete 
exoenzymes like proteases, amylases, xylanases, cellulases and peroxidases which 
have potential industrial applications. They also produce bacteriorhodopsin, 
compatible solutes, pigments, biopolymers, secondary metabolites like 
biosurfactants, polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) and exopolysaccharides and 
antimicrobial/anticancer compounds. They have unique metabolic pathways which 
can be used to treat industrial pollutants, heavy metals and waste water.

Modernisation of our households created novel opportunities for microbial growth 
and thus changed the array of microorganisms we come in contact with. While many 
studies have investigated microorganisms in the air and dust, tap water, another 
major input of microbial propagules, has received far less attention. The 
quality of drinking water in developed world is strictly regulated to prevent 
immediate danger to human health. However, fungi, algae, protists and bacteria 
of less immediate concern are usually not screened for. These organisms can thus 
use water as a vector of transmission into the households, especially if they 
are resistant to various water treatment procedures. Good tolerance of 
unfavourable abiotic conditions is also important for survival once microbes 
enter the household. Limitation of water availability, high or low temperatures, 
application of antimicrobial chemicals and other measures are taken to prevent 
indoor microbial overgrowth. These conditions, together with a large number of 
novel chemicals in our homes, shape the diversity and abundance of indoor 
microbiota through constant selection of the most resilient species, resulting 
in a substantial overlap in diversity of indoor and natural extreme 
environments. At least in fungi, extremotolerance has been linked to human 
pathogenicity, explaining why many species found in novel indoor habitats (such 
as dishwasher) are notable opportunistic pathogens. As a result, microorganisms 
that often enter our households with water and are then enriched in novel indoor 
habitats might have a hitherto underestimated impact on the well-being of the 
increasingly indoor-bound human population. KEY POINTS: Domestic environment 
harbours a large diversity of microorganisms. Microbiota of water-related indoor 
habitats mainly originates from tap water. Bathrooms, kitchens and household 
appliances select for polyextremotolerant species. Many household-related 
microorganisms are human opportunistic pathogens.

The Central Andes region displays unexplored ecosystems of shallow lakes and 
salt flats at mean altitudes of 3700 m. Being isolated and hostile, these 
so-called ""High-Altitude Andean Lakes"" (HAAL) are pristine and have been exposed 
to little human influence. HAAL proved to be a rich source of microbes showing 
interesting adaptations to life in extreme settings (poly-extremophiles) such as 
alkalinity, high concentrations of arsenic and dissolved salts, intense dryness, 
large daily ambient thermal amplitude, and extreme solar radiation levels. This 
work reviews HAAL microbiodiversity, taking into account different microbial 
niches, such as plankton, benthos, microbial mats and microbialites. The modern 
stromatolites and other microbialites discovered recently at HAAL are 
highlighted, as they provide unique modern-though quite imperfect-analogs of 
environments proxy for an earlier time in Earth's history (volcanic setting and 
profuse hydrothermal activity, low atmospheric O2 pressure, thin ozone layer and 
high UV exposure). Likewise, we stress the importance of HAAL microbes as model 
poly-extremophiles in the study of the molecular mechanisms underlying their 
resistance ability against UV and toxic or deleterious chemicals using genome 
mining and functional genomics. In future research directions, it will be 
necessary to exploit the full potential of HAAL poly-extremophiles in terms of 
their biotechnological applications. Current projects heading this way have 
yielded detailed molecular information and functional proof on novel 
extremoenzymes: i.e., DNA repair enzymes and arsenic efflux pumps for which 
medical and bioremediation applications, respectively, are envisaged. But still, 
much effort is required to unravel novel functions for this and other molecules 
that dwell in a unique biological treasure despite its being hidden high up, in 
the remote Andes.

High-altitude Andean lakes (HAAL) are a treasure chest for microbiological 
research in South America. Their indigenous microbial communities are exposed to 
extremely high UV irradiation and to multiple chemical extremes (Arsenic, high 
salt content, alkalinity). Microbes are found both, free-living or associated 
into microbial mats with different degrees of mineralization and lithification, 
including unique modern stromatolites located at 3570 m above sea level. 
Characterization of these polyextremophilic microbes began only recently, 
employing morphological and phylogenetic methods as well as high-throughput 
sequencing and proteomics approach. Aside from providing a general overview on 
microbial communities, special attention is given to various survival 
strategies; HAAL's microbes present a complex system of shared genetic and 
physiological mechanisms (UV-resistome) based on UV photoreceptors and stress 
sensors with their corresponding response regulators, UV avoidance and 
protection strategies, damage tolerance and UV damage repair. Molecular 
information will be provided for what is, so far the most studied HAAL molecule, 
a CPD-Class I photolyase from Acinetobacter Ver3 (Laguna Verde, 4400 m). This 
work further proposes some strategies that make an appeal for the preservation 
of HAAL, a highly fragile environment that offers promising and ample research 
possibilities.

Biotechnologist interest in extremophile microorganisms has increased in recent 
years. Alkaliphilic and alkali-tolerant fungi that resist alkaline pH are among 
these. Alkaline environments, both terrestrial and aquatic, can be created by 
nature or by human activities. Aspergillus nidulans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
are the two eukaryotic organisms whose pH-dependent gene regulation has received 
the most study. In both biological models, the PacC transcription factor 
activates the Pal/Rim pathway through two successive proteolytic mechanisms. 
PacC is a repressor of acid-expressed genes and an activator of 
alkaline-expressed genes when it is in an active state. It appears, however, 
that these are not the only mechanisms associated with pH adaptations in 
alkali-tolerant fungi. These fungi produce enzymes that are resistant to harsh 
conditions, i.e., alkaline pH, and can be used in technological processes, such 
as in the textile, paper, detergent, food, pharmaceutical, and leather tanning 
industries, as well as in bioremediation of pollutants. Consequently, it is 
essential to understand how these fungi maintain intracellular homeostasis and 
the signaling pathways that activate the physiological mechanisms of alkali 
resistance in fungi.

Alkaliphilic microorganisms are ubiquitous and inhabit various econiches on 
Earth. Alkaline environments suitable for alkaliphilic microbial communities may 
be created by certain geological processes or human activities. Moreover, a 
significant contribution to the emergence of alkaline conditions may be due to 
the activity of neutralophilic microorganisms through certain reactions, which 
explains the widespread distribution of alkaliphiles. Alkaliphilic 
microorganisms are part of extremophiles and become interesting and useful in 
environmental and industrial microbiology. With increasing knowledge of 
alkaliphiles, we greatly increase their biotechnological and industrial 
application potential. New microorganisms from natural habitats serve as a 
practically endless source of new enzymes. This chapter summarizes the scattered 
data on alkaliphiles isolated from habitats other than soda lakes. The 
conditions for occurrence of alkaline habitats are also considered. Moreover, 
the chapter reviews some important features on preparation of media for the 
isolation and cultivation of alkaliphiles. The chapter also includes relevant 
information on chromatographic analysis of alkaliphiles culture. Graphical

Extremophilic organisms are adapted to harsh environmental conditions like high 
temperature, extremely acidic or alkaline pH, high salt, or a combination of 
those. With a few exceptions extremophilic bacteria are colonizing only 
moderately hot biotopes, whereas hyperthermophiles are found specifically among 
archaea (formerly 'archaebacteria') which can thrive at temperatures close to or 
even above the boiling point of water. It has been a challenging question 
whether the special properties of their proteins and membranes have been 
acquired by adaptation, or whether they might reflect early evolutionary states 
as suggested by their phylogenetic position at the lowest branches of the 
universal tree of life.

Extremophiles comprise microorganisms that are able to grow and thrive in 
extreme environments, including in an acidic or alkaline pH, high or low 
temperatures, high concentrations of pollutants, and salts, among others. These 
organisms are promising for environmental biotechnology due to their unique 
physiological and enzymatic characteristics, which allow them to survive in 
harsh environments. Due to the stability and persistence of these microorganisms 
under adverse environmental conditions, they can be used for the bioremediation 
of environments contaminated with extremely recalcitrant pollutants. Here, we 
provide an overview of extremophiles and the role of ""omics"" in the field of 
bioremediation of environmental pollutants, including hydrocarbons, textile dyes 
and metals.

With industrialization and development in modern science enzymes and their 
applications increased widely. There is always a hunt for new proficient enzymes 
with novel properties to meet specific needs of various industrial sectors. 
Along with the high efficiency, the green and eco-friendly side of enzymes 
attracts human attention, as they form a true answer to counter the hazardous 
and toxic conventional industrial catalyst. Lipases have always earned 
industrial attention due to the broad range of hydrolytic and synthetic 
reactions they catalyse. When these catalytic properties get accompanied by 
features like temperature stability, pH stability, and solvent stability lipases 
becomes an appropriate tool for use in many industrial processes. Extremophilic 
lipases offer the same, thermostable: hot and cold active thermophilic and 
psychrophilic lipases, acid and alkali resistant and active acidophilic and 
alkaliphilic lipases, and salt tolerant halophilic lipases form excellent 
biocatalyst for detergent formulations, biofuel synthesis, ester synthesis, food 
processing, pharmaceuticals, leather, and paper industry. An interesting 
application of these lipases is in the bioremediation of lipid waste in harsh 
environments. The review gives a brief account on various extremophilic lipases 
with emphasis on thermophilic, psychrophilic, halophilic, alkaliphilic, and 
acidophilic lipases, their sources, biochemical properties, and potential 
applications in recent decades.

The pack ice of Earth's polar oceans appears to be frozen white desert, devoid 
of life. However, beneath the snow lies a unique habitat for a group of bacteria 
and microscopic plants and animals that are encased in an ice matrix at low 
temperatures and light levels, with the only liquid being pockets of 
concentrated brines. Survival in these conditions requires a complex suite of 
physiological and metabolic adaptations, but sea-ice organisms thrive in the 
ice, and their prolific growth ensures they play a fundamental role in polar 
ecosystems. Apart from their ecological importance, the bacterial and algae 
species found in sea ice have become the focus for novel biotechnology, as well 
as being considered proxies for possible life forms on ice-covered 
extraterrestrial bodies.

Biological treatment methods overcome many of the drawbacks of physicochemical 
strategies and play a significant role in removing dye contamination for 
environmental sustainability. Numerous microorganisms have been investigated as 
promising dye-degrading candidates because of their high metabolic potential. 
However, few can be applied on a large scale because of the extremely harsh 
conditions in effluents polluted with multiple dyes, such as alkaline pH, high 
salinity/heavy metals/dye concentration, high temperature, and oxidative stress. 
Therefore, extremophilic microorganisms offer enormous opportunities for 
practical biodegradation processes as they are naturally adapted to multi-stress 
conditions due to the special structure of their cell wall, capsule, S-layer 
proteins, extracellular polymer substances (EPS), and siderophores structural 
and functional properties such as poly-enzymes produced. This review provides 
scientific information for a broader understanding of general dyes, their 
toxicity, and their harmful effects. The advantages and disadvantages of 
physicochemical methods are also highlighted and compared to those of microbial 
strategies. New techniques and methodologies used in recent studies are briefly 
summarized and discussed. In particular, this study addresses the key adaptation 
mechanisms, whole-cell, enzymatic degradation, and non-enzymatic pathways in 
aerobic, anaerobic, and combination conditions of extremophiles in dye 
degradation and decolorization. Furthermore, they have special metabolic 
pathways and protein frameworks that contribute significantly to the complete 
mineralization and decolorization of the dye when all functions are turned on. 
The high potential efficiency of microbial degradation by unculturable and 
multi-enzyme-producing extremophiles remains a question that needs to be 
answered in practical research.

Extremophiles are remarkable organisms that thrive in the harshest environments 
on Earth, such as hydrothermal vents, hypersaline lakes and pools, alkaline soda 
lakes, deserts, cold oceans, and volcanic areas. These organisms have developed 
several strategies to overcome environmental stress and nutrient limitations. 
Thus, they are among the best model organisms to study adaptive mechanisms that 
lead to stress tolerance. Genetic and structural information derived from 
extremophiles and extremozymes can be used for bioengineering other nontolerant 
enzymes. Furthermore, extremophiles can be a valuable resource for novel 
biotechnological and biomedical products due to their biosynthetic properties. 
However, understanding life under extreme conditions is challenging due to the 
difficulties of in vitro cultivation and observation since > 99% of organisms 
cannot be cultivated. Consequently, only a minor percentage of the potential 
extremophiles on Earth have been discovered and characterized. Herein, we 
present a review of culture-independent methods, sequence-based metagenomics 
(SBM), and single amplified genomes (SAGs) for studying enzymes from 
extremophiles, with a focus on prokaryotic (archaea and bacteria) 
microorganisms. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive list of extremozymes 
discovered via metagenomics and SAGs.

Lipolytic enzymes include triacylglycerol lipases (EC 3.1.1.3) and esterases (EC 
3.1.1.1) that catalyze the cleavage and formation of ester bonds. They are 
potential industrial biocatalysts because of their broad range of activities on 
natural and synthetic substrates, high stability in organic solvents, thermal 
stability, stability in highly acidic and alkaline pH conditions and enantio-, 
regio- and chemo-selectivity. They also have varied applications in different 
sectors, among which industrial biotechnology, the production of cleaning 
agents, and pharmaceuticals are the most important ones. Identifying 
extremophilic lipolytic enzymes is of paramount interest and is a growing field 
in academic and industrial research. This review is focused on the current 
knowledge and future avenues of investigation on lipolytic enzymes sourced from 
the underexploited archaeal domain. Archaea is a potential source for novel 
extremophilic enzymes, which have high demand in the industries. The archaeal 
lipases and esterases are clustered into different families based on their 
similarity/dissimilarity at the genetic level and protein structures. The 
updated information on characterized and putative lipase sequences has also been 
presented in this paper. Common structural scaffolds of archaeal lipases have 
been deduced and discussed in this review. However, huge diversity at the level 
of their genetic sequences has yet to be correlated with the structure-function 
relationship. Based on their biochemical properties, possible applications and 
future prospective of archaeal lipolytic enzymes have also been proposed.

Although some anaerobic and aerobic mesophiles have long been known to grow at 
alkaline pH (above 9.5), little was known until recently about thermophilic 
alkaliphiles, termed now alkalithermophiles. This minireview describes presently 
known and recently validly described anaerobic alkalithermophilic bacteria 
(pHopt55C > 8.5; Topt > 55 degrees C) and alkalitolerant thermophiles (pHopt55C 
< 8.5 but pHmax55C above 9.0). Some of these are widely distributed, but others 
have been isolated (thus far) only from one specific location. This novel group 
of anaerobic bacteria is comprised of physiologically different genera and 
species which, so far, all belong to the Gram-type positive Bacillus-Clostridium 
phylogenetic subbranch. An interesting feature of these anaerobic 
alkalithermophiles is that most of the isolates have short doubling times. The 
fastest growing among them are strains of Thermobrachium celere, with doubling 
times as short as 10 min while growing above pH 9.0 and above 55 degrees C.

The cleaning power of detergents seems to have peaked; all detergents contain 
similar ingredients and are based on similar detergency mechanisms. To improve 
detergency, modern types of heavy-duty powder detergents and automatic 
dishwasher detergents usually contain one or more enzymes, such as protease, 
amylase, cellulase, and lipase. Alkaliphilic Bacillus strains are often good 
sources of alkaline extracellular enzymes, the properties of which fulfil the 
essential requirements for enzymes to be used in detergents. We have isolated 
numbers of alkaliphilic Bacillus that produce such alkaline detergent enzymes, 
including cellulase (CMCase), protease, alpha-amylase, and debranching enzymes, 
and have succeeded in large-scale industrial production of some of these 
enzymes. Here, we describe the enzymatic properties, genetics, and structures of 
the detergent enzymes that we have developed.

A vast array of organisms is known thriving in high pH environments. The 
biotechnological, medical, and environmental importance of this remarkable group 
of organisms has attracted a great deal of interest among researchers and 
industrialists. One of the most intriguing phenomena of alkaliphiles that 
engrossed researchers' attention is their adaptation to high pH and ability to 
thrive in the ""extreme"" condition which is often lethal to other organisms. 
Studies made in this line revealed that alkaliphiles deployed a range of 
adaptive strategies to overcome the various challenges of life in high pH 
environments. This chapter highlights some of the challenges and the most 
important structural and functional adaptations that alkaliphiles evolved to 
circumvent the hurdles and flourish in alkaline habitats. The fascinating 
alkaliphiles' pH homeostasis that effectively maintains a lower cytoplasmic pH 
than its extracellular environment and the remarkable bioenergetics that produce 
ATP much faster than non-alkaliphiles systems are reviewed in detail. Moreover, 
the adaptive mechanisms that alkaliphiles employ to keep the structural and 
functional integrity of their biomolecules at elevated pH are assessed.It is 
undeniable that our understanding of alkaliphiles adaptation mechanisms to high 
pH is expanding with time. However, considering that little is known so far 
about the adaptation of life in alkaline milieu, it seems that this is just the 
beginning. Probably, there is a lot more waiting for discovery, and some of 
these issues are raised in the chapter, which not only summarizes the relevant 
literature but also forwards new insights regarding high pH adaptation. 
Moreover, an effort is made to include the largely neglected eukaryotic 
organisms' adaptation to high pH habitats.

Chromium (Cr) compounds are usually toxins and exist abundantly in two different 
forms, Cr(VI) and Cr(III), in nature. Their contamination in any environment is 
a major problem. Many extreme environments including cold climate, warm climate, 
acidic environment, basic/alkaline environment, hypersaline environment, 
radiation, drought, high pressure, and anaerobic conditions have accumulated 
elevated Cr contamination. These harsh physicochemical conditions associated 
with Cr(VI) contamination damage biological systems in various ways. However, 
several unique microorganisms belonging to phylogenetically distant taxa 
(bacteria, fungi, and microalgae) owing to different and very distinct 
physiological characteristics can withstand extremities of Cr(VI) in different 
physicochemical environments. These challenging situations offer great potential 
and extended proficiencies in extremophiles for environmental and 
biotechnological applications. On these issues, the present review draws 
attention to Cr(VI) contamination from diverse extreme environmental regions. 
The study gives a detailed account on the ecology and biogeography of 
Cr(VI)-resistant microorganisms in inhospitable environments, and their use for 
detoxifying Cr(VI) and other applications. The study also focuses on 
physiological, multi-omics, and genetic engineering approaches of 
Cr(VI)-resistant extremophiles.

Our knowledge on the Microbiology of the Atacama Desert has increased steadily 
and substantially during the last two decades. This information now supports a 
paradigmatic change on the Atacama Desert from a sterile, uninhabitable 
territory to a hyperarid region colonized by a rich microbiota that includes 
extremophiles and extreme-tolerant microorganisms. Also, extensive reports are 
available on the prevalent physical and chemical environmental conditions, 
ecological niches and, the abundance, diversity and organization of the 
microbial life in the Atacama Desert. This territory is a highly desiccated 
environment due to the absence of regular rain events. Liquid water scarcity is 
the most serious environmental factor affecting the Atacama Desert 
microorganisms. The intense solar irradiation in this region contributes, in a 
synergistic fashion with desiccation, to limit the survival and growth of the 
microbial life. In order to overcome these two extreme conditions, successful 
microorganisms, organized as microbial consortia, take advantage of (a) the 
physical characteristics of lithic habitats, which provide sites for 
colonization on, within or below the rock substrate, the attenuation and 
filtration of the intense solar irradiation and, the collection of liquid water 
from incoming fog formations and by water vapour condensation and deliquescence 
on or within their surfaces, and (b) the biological adaptations of members of 
the microbial communities that allow them to synthesize hydrophilic 
macromolecules, antioxidants and UV-light absorbents. Lithic habitats have been 
considered specialized shelters where life forms can reach protection at 
environments subjected to extremes of desiccation and solar irradiation, here on 
Earth or elsewhere. This review is an overview of part of the scientific 
information collected on lithobionts from the Atacama Desert, their rock 
substrates and their strategies to cope with extremes of desiccation and intense 
photosynthetic active radiation and UV irradiations.

Archaea are environmentally ubiquitous on Earth, and their extremophilic and 
metabolically versatile phenotypes make them useful as model systems for 
astrobiology. Here, we reveal a new functional group of halo(natrono)archaea 
able to utilize alpha-d-glucans (amylopectin, amylose and glycogen), sugars, and 
glycerol as electron donors and carbon sources for sulfur respiration. They are 
facultative anaerobes enriched from hypersaline sediments with either 
amylopectin, glucose or glycerol as electron/carbon sources and elemental sulfur 
as the terminal electron acceptor. They include 10 strains of neutrophilic 
haloarchaea from circum pH-neutral lakes and one natronoarchaeon from soda-lake 
sediments. The neutrophilic isolates can grow by fermentation, although addition 
of S0 or dimethyl sulfoxide increased growth rate and biomass yield (with a 
concomitant decrease in H2 ). Natronoarchaeal isolate AArc-S grew only by 
respiration, either anaerobically with S0 or thiosulfate as the terminal 
electron acceptor, or aerobically. Through genome analysis of five 
representative strains, we detected the full set of enzymes required for the 
observed catabolic and respiratory phenotypes. These findings provide evidence 
that sulfur-respiring haloarchaea partake in biogeochemical sulfur cycling, 
linked to terminal anaerobic carbon mineralization in hypersaline anoxic 
habitats. We discuss the implications for life detection in analogue 
environments such as the polar subglacial brine-lakes of Mars.

Decades of nuclear activities have left a legacy of hazardous radioactive waste, 
which must be isolated from the biosphere for over 100,000 years. The preferred 
option for safe waste disposal is a deep subsurface geological disposal facility 
(GDF). Due to the very long geological timescales required, and the complexity 
of materials to be disposed of (including a wide range of nutrients and electron 
donors/acceptors) microbial activity will likely play a pivotal role in the safe 
operation of these mega-facilities. A GDF environment provides many metabolic 
challenges to microbes that may inhabit the facility, including high 
temperature, pressure, radiation, alkalinity, and salinity, depending on the 
specific disposal concept employed. However, as our understanding of the 
boundaries of life is continuously challenged and expanded by the discovery of 
novel extremophiles in Earth's most inhospitable environments, it is becoming 
clear that microorganisms must be considered in GDF safety cases to ensure 
accurate predictions of long-term performance. This review explores 
extremophilic adaptations and how this knowledge can be applied to challenge our 
current assumptions on microbial activity in GDF environments. We conclude that 
regardless of concept, a GDF will consist of multiple extremes and it is of high 
importance to understand the limits of polyextremophiles under realistic 
environmental conditions.

(carboxymethylcellulase) as an additive for improving the cleaning effect of 
detergents. Enzymatic properties of some candidate cellulases fulfilled the 
essential requirements for enzymes to be used practically in laundry detergents. 
Here I describe the properties and possible catalytic mechanism of the

The haloalkalitolerant bacterium Egicoccus halophilus EGI 80432T exhibits high 
adaptability to saline-alkaline environment. The salinity adaptation mechanism 
of E. halophilus EGI 80432T was fully understood based on transcriptome analyses 
and physiological responses; however, the alkaline response mechanism has not 
yet been investigated. Here, we investigated the alkaline response mechanism of 
E. halophilus EGI 80432T by a transcriptomic comparison. In this study, the 
genes involved in the glycolysis, TCA cycle, starch, and trehalose metabolism 
for energy production and storage, were up-regulated under highly alkaline 
condition. Furthermore, genes responsible for the production of acidic and 
neutral metabolites, i.e., acetate, pyruvate, formate, glutamate, threonine, and 
ectoine, showed increased expression under highly alkaline condition, compared 
with the control pH condition. In contrast, the opposite results were observed 
in proton capture or retention gene expression profiles, i.e., cation/proton 
antiporters and ATP synthases. The above results revealed that E. halophilus EGI 
80432T likely tended to adopt an ""acidic metabolites production"" strategy in 
response to a highly alkaline condition. These findings would pave the way for 
further studies in the saline-alkaline adaptation mechanisms of E. halophilus 
EGI 80432T, and hopefully provide a new insight into the foundational theory and 
application in ecological restoration with saline-alkaline strains.

Extremophiles are potential resources for alkaline protease production. In order 
to search for alkaline protease producers, we isolated and screened alkaliphilic 
microorganisms from alkaline saline environments. The microorganism HSL10 was 
identified as a member of the genus Microbacterium by morphological observation, 
Gram staining and sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and the 16S-23S rRNA 
intergenic spacer region. By colony-forming unit counting under alkali or salt 
stress, it was further identified as an alkaliphilic microbe with mild 
halotolerance. In addition, it was capable of secreting alkaline proteases, 
evidenced by larger hydrolyzation zones in the skim milk-containing medium at pH 
9.0 than at pH 7.0. Subsequently, we demonstrated that both NaCl and yeast 
extract significantly promoted protease production by HSL10. Finally, we 
established a sensitive colorimetric method for the detection of protease 
production by HSL10 under neutral and alkaline conditions, by using the Bradford 
reagent for substrate staining to improve the contrast between the hydrolyzation 
zone and the substrate background on agar plates. HSL10 was the first example of 
an alkaliphilic protease-producing member in Microbacterium, and its isolation 
and characterization have both academic and commercial importance.

reverberated through the international press and excited the imagination of 
humankind. Why? Because in the past few decades we have come to realize that 
where there is liquid water on Earth, virtually no matter what the physical 
conditions, there is life. What we previously thought of as insurmountable 
physical and chemical barriers to life, we now see as yet another niche 
harbouring 'extremophiles'. This realization, coupled with new data on the 
survival of microbes in the space environment and modelling of the potential for 
transfer of life between celestial bodies, suggests that life could be more 
common than previously thought. Here we examine critically what it means to be 
an extremophile, and the implications of this for evolution, biotechnology and 
especially the search for life in the Universe.

Extremes of pH present a challenge to microbial life and our understanding of 
survival strategies for microbial consortia, particularly at high pH, remains 
limited. The utilization of extracellular polymeric substances within complex 
biofilms allows micro-organisms to obtain a greater level of control over their 
immediate environment. This manipulation of the immediate environment may confer 
a survival advantage in adverse conditions to biofilms. Within the present study 
alkaliphilic biofilms were created at pH 11.0, 12.0, or 13.0 from an existing 
alkaliphilic community. In each pH system, the biofilm matrix provided pH 
buffering, with the internal pH being 1.0-1.5 pH units lower than the aqueous 
environment. Increasing pH resulted in a reduced removal of substrate and 
standing biomass associated with the biofilm. At the highest pH investigated (pH 
13.0), the biofilms matrix contained a greater degree of eDNA and the microbial 
community was dominated by Dietzia sp. and Anaerobranca sp.

Haloalkaliphiles are double extremophilic organisms thriving both at high 
salinity and alkaline pH. Although numerous haloalkaliphilic representatives 
have been identified among Archaea and Bacteria over the past 15 years, the 
adaptations underlying their prosperity at haloalkaline conditions are scarcely 
known. A multi-level adaptive strategy was proposed to occur in haloalkaliphilic 
organisms isolated from saline alkaline and soda environments including 
adjustments in the cell wall structure, plasma membrane lipid composition, 
membrane transport systems, bioenergetics, and osmoregulation. Isolation of 
chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing γ-Proteobacteria from soda lakes allowed 
the elucidation of the structural and physiological differences between 
haloalkaliphilic (prefer NaCl) and natronophilic (prefer NaHCO3/Na2CO3, i.e. 
soda) microbes.

Halomonas alkalicola CICC 11012s can grow at pH 12.5, the highest pH at which 
the organisms in the genus Halomonas can grow. Genomic analysis reveals that H. 
alkalicola adapts to alkaline stress using a variety of adaptive strategies; 
however, the detailed mechanism for its growth at high-alkaline conditions has 
not been elucidated. Therefore, in this study, the adaptations of H. alkalicola 
in response to extreme alkaline stress were investigated. A sharp decrease of 
alkaliphilic tolerance was observed in mutants E. coli ΔEctonB and H. alkalicola 
ΔHatonB. Expressions of the gene clusters encoding TonB-dependent transport 
system and iron complex transport system in H. alkalicola grown under extreme 
alkaline conditions were markedly up-regulated. We then compared the 
intracellular ionic iron content and iron-chelating ability of mutant strain 
with those of wild-type strain to understand the influence of TonB-dependent 
transport system on the alkaline responses. The results indicated that the 
presence of TonB-dependent transport system increased the alkaline tolerance of 
H. alkalicola grown at high-alkaline conditions, but had no effects when the 
strain was grown at neutral pH and low-alkaline conditions. Meanwhile, the 
presence of this system increased the transport and accumulation of ionic irons 
to maintain intracellular metabolic homeostasis, which in turn could increase 
the tolerance of the strain to extreme alkaline conditions. Based on the 
results, we established a model representing the interactions between 
TonB-dependent transport system, alkaline tolerance, and intracellular ionic 
iron that could help deepen the understanding of the alkaline response mechanism 
of alkaliphilic bacteria.

Black yeasts (BY) comprise a group of polyextremotolerant fungi, mainly 
belonging to the order Chaetothyriales, which are capable of colonizing a wide 
range of extreme environments. The tolerance to hostile habitats can be 
explained by their intrinsic ability to survive under acidic, alkaline, and 
toxic conditions, high temperature, low nutrient availability, and osmotic and 
mechanical stress. Occasionally, some species can cause human 
chromoblastomycosis, a chronic subcutaneous infection, as well as disseminated 
or cerebral phaeohyphomycosis. Three years after the release of the first black 
yeast genome, the number of projects for sequencing these organisms has 
significantly increased. Over 37 genomes of important opportunistic and saprobic 
black yeasts and relatives are now available in different databases. The 
whole-genome sequencing, as well as the analysis of differentially expressed 
mRNAs and the determination of protein expression profiles generated an 
unprecedented amount of data, requiring the development of a curated repository 
to provide easy accesses to this information. In the present article, we review 
various aspects of the impact of genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics on 
black yeast studies. We discuss recent key findings achieved by the use of these 
technologies and further directions for medical mycology in this area. An 
important vehicle is the Working Groups on Black Yeasts and Chromoblastomycosis, 
under the umbrella of ISHAM, which unite the clinicians and a highly diverse 
population of fundamental scientists to exchange data for joint publications.

The increasing demand for energy and the generation of solid waste have caused 
an alarming rise in fly ash production globally. Since heavy metals continue to 
be in demand for the production of materials, resource recovery from the 
recycling of these wastes has the potential to delay the depletion of natural 
ores. The use of microorganisms for the leaching of metals, in a process called 
bioleaching, is an eco-friendly and economical way to treat the metal-laden 
wastes. Bioleaching of fly ash is challenging due largely to the alkaline nature 
and toxic levels of heavy metals which are detrimental to microbial growth and 
bioleaching activity. The present work reports the isolation of indigenous 
bacteria from a local landfill site and their bioleaching performance 
[corrected]. 38 autochthonous strains of bacteria were isolated from eight 
samples collected and plated on five different media. 18 of the isolates showed 
bioleaching potential, with significant alkaline pH or fly ash tolerance. 
Genetic characterization of the strains revealed a dominance of Firmicutes, with 
Alkalibacterium sp. TRTYP6 showing highest fly ash tolerance of up to 20% w/v 
fly ash, and growth over a pH range 8-12.5. The organism selectively recovered 
about 52% Cu from the waste. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
time a study on bioleaching with extreme alkaliphiles is reported.

Industrial demands for enzymes that are stable in a broad range of conditions 
are increasing. Such enzymes, one of which is α-amylase, could be produced by 
extremophiles. This study reports a thermostable α-amylase produced by a newly 
isolated Geobacillus sp. nov. from a geothermal area. The phylogenetic analysis 
of the 16S rRNA gene showed that the isolate formed a separate branch with 95% 
homology to Geobacillus sp. After precipitation using ammonium sulphate followed 
by ion-exchange chromatography, the enzyme produced a specific activity of 25.1 
(U/mg) with a purity of 6.5-fold of the crude extract. The molecular weight of 
the enzyme was approximately 12.2 kDa. The optimum activity was observed at 75 
°C and pH 8. The activity increased in the presence of Ba2+ and Fe2+ but 
decreased in the presence of K+ and Mg2+. Ca2+ and Mn2+ increased the activity 
slightly. The activity completely diminished with the addition of Cu2+. EDTA and 
PMSF also sharply reduced enzyme activity. Although the stability was moderate, 
the low molecular weight could be an important feature for its future 
applications.

Archaeal microorganisms that grow optimally at Na(+) concentrations of 1.7 M, or 
the equivalent of 10% (w/v) NaCl, and greater are considered to be extreme 
halophiles. This review encompasses extremely halophilic archaea and their 
growth characteristics with respect to the correlation between the extent of 
alkaline pH and elevated temperature optima and the extent of salt tolerance. 
The focus is on poly-extremophiles, i.e., taxa growing optimally at a Na(+) 
concentration at or above 1.7 M (approximately 10% w/v NaCl); alkaline pH, at or 
above 8.5; and elevated temperature optima, at or above 50°C. So far, only a 
very few extreme halophiles that are able to grow optimally under alkaline 
conditions as well as at elevated temperatures have been isolated. The 
distribution of extremely halophilic archaea growing optimally at 3.4 M Na(+) 
(approximately 20% w/v NaCl) is bifurcated with respect to pH optima, either 
they are neutrophilic, with a pH(opt) of approximately 7, or strongly 
alkaliphilic, with pH(opt) at or above 8.5. Amongst these extreme halophiles 
which have elevated pH optima, only four taxa have an optimum temperature above 
50°C: Haloarcula quadrata (52°C), Haloferax elongans (53°C), Haloferax 
mediterranei (51°C) and Natronolimnobius 'aegyptiacus' (55°C).

Micro-algae have potential as sustainable sources of energy and products and 
alternative mode of agriculture. However, their mass cultivation is challenging 
due to low survival under harsh outdoor conditions and competition from other, 
undesired, species. Extremophilic micro-algae have a role to play by virtue of 
their ability to grow under acidic or alkaline pH, high temperature, light, CO2 
level and metal concentration. In this review, we provide several examples of 
potential biotechnological applications of extremophilic micro-algae and the 
ranges of tolerated extremes. We also discuss the adaptive mechanisms of 
tolerance to these extremes. Analysis of phylogenetic relationship of the 
reported extremophiles suggests certain groups of the Kingdom Protista to be 
more tolerant to extremophilic conditions than other taxa. While extremophilic 
microalgae are beginning to be explored, much needs to be done in terms of the 
physiology, molecular biology, metabolic engineering and outdoor cultivation 
trials before their true potential is realized.

Cyanotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by cyanobacteria, of varied 
chemical nature and toxic effects. Although cyanobacteria thrive in all kinds of 
ecosystems on Earth even under very harsh conditions, current knowledge on 
cyanotoxin distribution is almost restricted to freshwaters from temperate 
latitudes. In this review, we bring to the forefront the presence of cyanotoxins 
in extreme environments. Cyanotoxins have been reported especially in polar 
deserts (both from the Arctic and Antarctica) and alkaline lakes, but also in 
hot deserts, hypersaline environments, and hot springs. Cyanotoxins detected in 
these ecosystems include neurotoxins-anatoxin-a, anatoxin-a (S), paralytic 
shellfish toxins, β-methylaminopropionic acid, N-(2-aminoethyl) glycine and 
2,4-diaminobutyric acid- and hepatotoxins -cylindrospermopsins, microcystins and 
nodularins-with microcystins being the most frequently reported. Toxin 
production there has been linked to at least eleven cyanobacterial genera yet 
only three of these (Arthrospira, Synechococcus and Oscillatoria) have been 
confirmed as producers in culture. Beyond a comprehensive analysis of cyanotoxin 
presence in each of the extreme environments, this review also identifies the 
main knowledge gaps to overcome (e.g., scarcity of isolates and -omics data, 
among others) toward an initial assessment of ecological and human health risks 
in these amazing ecosystems developing at the very edge of life.

Bioremediation is increasingly viewed as an appropriate remediation technology 
for hydrocarbon-contaminated polar soils. As for all soils, the successful 
application of bioremediation depends on appropriate biodegradative microbes and 
environmental conditions in situ. Laboratory studies have confirmed that 
hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria typically assigned to the genera Rhodococcus, 
Sphingomonas or Pseudomonas are present in contaminated polar soils. However, as 
indicated by the persistence of spilled hydrocarbons, environmental conditions 
in situ are suboptimal for biodegradation in polar soils. Therefore, it is 
likely that ex situ bioremediation will be the method of choice for ameliorating 
and controlling the factors limiting microbial activity, i.e. low and 
fluctuating soil temperatures, low levels of nutrients, and possible alkalinity 
and low moisture. Care must be taken when adding nutrients to the 
coarse-textured, low-moisture soils prevalent in continental Antarctica and the 
high Arctic because excess levels can inhibit hydrocarbon biodegradation by 
decreasing soil water potentials. Bioremediation experiments conducted on site 
in the Arctic indicate that land farming and biopiles may be useful approaches 
for bioremediation of polar soils.

Antifreeze proteins and ice-binding proteins have been discovered in a diverse 
range of extremophiles and have the ability to modulate the growth and formation 
of ice crystals. Considering the importance of cryoscience across transport, 
biomedicine, and climate science, there is significant interest in developing 
synthetic macromolecular mimics of antifreeze proteins, in particular to 
reproduce their property of ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI). This 
activity is a continuum rather than an ""on/off"" property and there may be 
multiple molecular mechanisms which give rise to differences in this observable 
property; the limiting concentrations for ice growth vary by more than a 
thousand between an antifreeze glycoprotein and poly(vinyl alcohol), for 
example. The aim of this article is to provide a concise comparison of a range 
of natural and synthetic materials that are known to have IRI, thus providing a

In a global context where the development of more environmentally conscious 
technologies is an urgent need, the demand for enzymes for industrial processes 
is on the rise. Compared to conventional chemical catalysts, the implementation 
of biocatalysis presents important benefits including higher selectivity, 
increased sustainability, reduction in operating costs and low toxicity, which 
translate into cleaner production processes, lower environmental impact as well 
as increasing the safety of the operating staff. Most of the currently available 
commercial enzymes are of mesophilic origin, displaying optimal activity in 
narrow ranges of conditions, which limits their actual application under 
industrial settings. For this reason, enzymes from extremophilic microorganisms 
stand out for their specific characteristics, showing higher stability, activity 
and robustness than their mesophilic counterparts. Their unique structural 
adaptations allow them to resist denaturation at high temperatures and salinity, 
remain active at low temperatures, function at extremely acidic or alkaline pHs 
and high pressure, and participate in reactions in organic solvents and 
unconventional media. Because of the increased interest to replace chemical 
catalysts, the global enzymes market is continuously growing, with hydrolases 
being the most prominent type of enzymes, holding approximately two-third share, 
followed by oxidoreductases. The latter enzymes catalyze electron transfer 
reactions and are one of the most abundant classes of enzymes within cells. They 
hold a significant industrial potential, especially those from extremophiles, as 
their applications are multifold. In this article we aim to review the 
properties and potential applications of five different types of extremophilic 
oxidoreductases: laccases, hydrogenases, glutamate dehydrogenases (GDHs), 
catalases and superoxide dismutases (SODs). This selection is based on the 
extensive experience of our research group working with these particular 
enzymes, from the discovery up to the development of commercial products 
available for the research market.

Halophilic enzymes contain a large number of acidic amino acids and marginal 
large hydrophobic amino acids, which make them highly soluble even under 
strongly hydrophobic conditions. This characteristic of halophilic enzymes 
provides potential for their industrial application. However, halophilic enzymes 
easily degrade when used for industrial applications compared with enzymes from 
other extremophiles because of their instability in low-salt environments. We 
aimed to clarify the stabilization mechanism of halophilic enzymes. We 
previously attempted to express halophilic alkaline phosphatase from Halomonas 
(HaALP) in non-halophilic E. coli. However, the expressed HaALP showed little 
activity. Therefore, we overexpressed HaALP in Gram-positive non-halophilic 
Brevibacillus choshinensis in this study, which was successfully expressed and 
purified in its active form. HaALP was denatured in 6 M urea, refolded using 
various salts and the non-ionic osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), and 
assessed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. HaALP refolded in 3 M 
NaCl or 3 M TMAO containing Na+ ions. Hydrophobic interactions due to a high 
salt concentration or TMAO enhanced the formation of the folding intermediate 
(the monomer precursor), and only Na+ ions activated the dimer form. This 
insight into the stabilization mechanism of HaALP may lead to the development of 
industrial applications of halophilic enzymes under low-salt conditions.

Prior to 2008, all previously studied conventional bacterial flagellar motors 
appeared to utilize either H+ or Na+ as coupling ions. Membrane-embedded stator 
complexes support conversion of energy using transmembrane electrochemical ion 
gradients. The main H+-coupled stators, known as MotAB, differ from Na+-coupled 
stators, PomAB of marine bacteria, and MotPS of alkaliphilic Bacillus. However, 
in 2008, a MotAB-type flagellar motor of alkaliphilic Bacillus clausii KSM-K16 
was revealed as an exception with the first dual-function motor. This bacterium 
was identified as the first bacterium with a single stator-rotor that can 
utilize both H+ and Na+ for ion-coupling at different pH ranges. Subsequently, 
another exception, a MotPS-type flagellar motor of alkaliphilic Bacillus 
alcalophilus AV1934, was reported to utilize Na+ plus K+ and Rb+ as coupling 
ions for flagellar rotation. In addition, the alkaline-tolerant bacterium 
Paenibacillus sp. TCA20, which can utilize divalent cations such as Ca2+, Mg2+, 
and Sr2+, was recently isolated from a hot spring in Japan, which contains a 
high Ca2+ concentration. These findings show that bacterial flagellar motors 
isolated from unique environments utilize unexpected coupling ions. This 
suggests that bacteria that grow in different extreme environments adapt to 
local conditions and evolve their motility machinery.

The studies have revealed alkaline exoinulinase produced by haloalkaliphilic 
phototrophic bacteria Ectothiorhodospirea mobilis Al-2 for the first time. A new 
method for the isolation of a homogeneous exoinulinase from the culture broth 
was developed and the properties of this enzyme have been investigated. It was 
shown that specified exoinulinase in contrast to the studied exoinulinases 
produced by microorganisms exhibits catalytic activity at the wide range of pH 
(7.0-10) and a temperature (20-60 °C) with a maximum of the inulolitic activity 
at pH 9.0 and 50 °C. The studied exoinulinase possessing also invertase activity 
(I/S1.4) is a monomeric protein with molecular mass 57Kda, as well as Km and 
Vmax for inulin 3.8 mM/ml and 10 µmol/ml/min-1, respectively. The studies of the 
influence of different metal ions on enzyme activity have shown that Mn+2, 
Cu+2, Co+2, Mg+2, NaCl 5-7% promote relatively higher catalytic activity while 
Zn+2, Cu+2 and Fe+2 partially suppress the enzyme activity and Hg2+completely 
inactivates the enzyme.The formation of only fructose and glucose at the 
enzymatic hydrolysis of inulin confirms that the studied exoinulinase belongs to 
the exo-type of enzymes. The obtained results supplement our fundamental 
knowledge in biochemistry-enzymology, as well as the biodiversity of 
microorganisms expressing exoinulinase. The studied exoinulinase exhibits 
activity at salinity of the medium and can potentially be used in the 
biotechnology of inulin bioconversion into bioproducts under alkaline 
conditions.

Extremophilic anaerobes are widespread in saline, acid, alkaline, and high or 
low temperature environments. Carbon is essential to living organisms and its 
fixation, degradation, or mineralization is driven by, up to now, six metabolic 
pathways. Organisms using these metabolisms are known as autotrophs, acetotrophs 
or carbon mineralizers, respectively. In anoxic and extreme environments, 
besides the well-studied Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, there are other five 
carbon fixation pathways responsible of autotrophy. Moreover, regarding carbon 
mineralization, two pathways perform this key process for carbon cycling. We 
might imagine that all the pathways can be found evenly distributed in microbial 
biotopes; however, in extreme environments, this does not occur. This manuscript 
reviews the most commonly reported anaerobic organisms that fix carbon and 
mineralize acetate in extreme anoxic habitats. Additionally, an inventory of 
autotrophic extremophiles by biotope is presented.

Soda lakes are highly alkaline extreme environments that form in closed drainage 
basins exposed to high evaporation rates. Because of the scarcity of Mg2+ and 
Ca2+ in the water chemistry, the lakes become enriched in CO3(2-) and Cl-, with 
pHs in the range 8 to > 12. Although there is a clear difference in prokaryotic 
communities between the hypersaline lakes where NaCl concentrations are > 15% 
w/v and more dilute waters, i.e., NaCl concentrations about 5% w/v, 
photosynthetic primary production appears to be the basis of all nutrient 
recycling. In both the aerobic and anaerobic microbial communities the major 
trophic groups responsible for cycling of carbon and sulfur have in general been 
identified. Systematic studies have shown that the microbes are alkaliphilic and 
many represent separate lineages within accepted taxa, while others show no 
strong relationship to known prokaryotes. Although alkaliphiles are widespread 
it seems probable that these organisms, especially those unique to the 
hypersaline lakes, evolved separately within an alkaline environment. Although 
present-day soda lakes are geologically quite recent, they have probably existed 
since archaean times, permitting the evolution of independent communities of 
alkaliphiles since an early period in the Earth's history.

The current study presents an overview of heavy metals bioremediation from 
halo-alkaline conditions by using extremophilic microorganisms. Heavy metal 
remediation from the extreme environment with high pH and elevated salt 
concentration is a challenge as mesophilic microorganisms are unable to thrive 
under these polyextremophilic conditions. Thus, for effective bioremediation of 
extreme systems, specialized microbes (extremophiles) are projected as potential 
bioremediating agents, that not only thrive under such extreme conditions but 
are also capable of remediating heavy metals from these environments. The 
physiological versatility of extremophiles especially halophiles and 
alkaliphiles and their enzymes (extremozymes) could conveniently be harnessed to 
remediate and detoxify heavy metals from the high alkaline saline environment. 
Bibliometric analysis has shown that research in this direction has found pace 
in recent years and thus this review is a timely attempt to highlight the 
importance of halo-alkaliphiles for effective contaminant removal in extreme 
conditions. Also, this review systematically presents insights on adaptive 
measures utilized by extremophiles to cope with harsh environments and outlines 
the role of extremophilic microbes in industrial wastewater treatment and 
recovery of metals from waste with relevant examples. Further, the major 
challenges and way forward for the effective applicability of halo-alkaliphilic 
microbes in heavy metals bioremediation from extremophilic conditions are also 
highlighted.

Constructed wetlands are an established treatment technology for a diverse range 
of polluted effluents. There is a long history of using wetlands as a unit 
process in treating acid mine drainage, while recent research has highlighted 
the potential for wetlands to buffer highly alkaline (pH>12) drainage. This 
paper reviews recent evidence on this topic, looking at wetlands treating acidic 
mine drainage, and highly alkaline leachates associated with drainage from 
lime-rich industrial by-products or where such residues are used as filter media 
in constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment. The limiting factors to the 
success of wetlands treating highly acidic waters are discussed with regard to 
design practice for the emerging application of wetlands to treat highly 
alkaline industrial discharges. While empirically derived guidelines (with 
area-adjusted contaminant removal rates typically quoted at 10 g Fe m(2)/day for 
influent waters pH>5.5; and 3.5-7 g acidity/m(2)/day for pH>4 to <5.5) for 
informing sizing of mine drainage treatment wetlands have generally been proved 
robust (probably due to conservatism), such data exhibit large variability 
within and between sites. Key areas highlighted for future research efforts 
include: (1) wider collation of mine drainage wetland performance data in 
regionalised datasets to improve empirically-derived design guidelines and (2) 
obtaining an improved understanding of nature of the extremophile microbial 
communities, microbially-mediated pollutant attenuation and rhizospheral 
processes in wetlands at extremes of pH. An enhanced knowledge of these (through 
multi-scale laboratory and field studies), will inform engineering design of 
treatment wetlands and assist in the move from the empirically-derived 
conservative sizing estimates that currently prevail to process-based optimal 
design guidance that could reduce costs and enhance the performance and 
longevity of wetlands for treating acidic and highly alkaline drainage waters.

The ability of anaerobic microorganisms to proliferate under extreme conditions 
is of widespread importance for microbial physiology, remediation, industry, and 
evolution. The halophilic alkalithermophiles are a novel group of 
polyextremophiles. Tolerance to alkaline pH, elevated NaCl concentrations, and 
high temperatures necessitates mechanisms for cytoplasmic pH acidification; 
permeability control of the cell membrane; and stability of proteins, the cell 
wall, and other cellular constituents to multiple extreme conditions. Although 
it is generally assumed that extremophiles growing at more than one extreme 
combine adaptive mechanisms for each individual extreme, adaptations for 
individual extremes often counteract each other. However, in alkaline, 
hypersaline niches heated via intense solar irradiation, culture-independent 
analyses have revealed the presence of an extensive diversity of aerobic and 
anaerobic microorganisms belonging to Bacteria and Archaea that survive and grow 
under multiple harsh conditions. Thus, polyextremophiles must have developed 
novel adaptive strategies enabling them to grow and proliferate under multiple 
extreme conditions. The recent isolation of two novel anaerobic, halophilic 
alkalithermophiles, Natranaerobius thermophilus and Halonatronum saccharophilum, 
will provide a platform for detailed biochemical, genomic, and proteomic 
experiments, allowing a greater understanding of the novel adaptive mechanisms 
undoubtedly employed by polyextremophiles. In this review, we highlight growth 
characteristics, ecology, and phylogeny of the anaerobic halophilic 
alkalithermophiles isolated. We also describe the bioenergetic and physiological 
problems posed by growth at the multiple extreme conditions of alkaline pH, high 
NaCl concentration, and elevated temperature under anoxic conditions and 
highlight recent findings and unresolved problems regarding adaptation to 
multiple extreme conditions.

Recent findings on the biochemical and molecular features of the following 
thermozymes are presented, based on their biotechnological use: alpha-amylase 
and amylopullulanase, used in starch processing; glucose isomerase, used in 
sweetener production; alcohol dehydrogenase, used in chemical synthesis; and 
alkaline phosphatase, used in diagnostics. The corresponding genes and 
recombinant proteins have been characterized in terms of sequence similarities, 
specific activities, thermophilicity, and unfolding kinetics. Site-directed and 
nested deletion mutagenesis were used to understand structure-function 
relationships. All these thermozymes display higher stability and activity than 
their counterparts currently used in the biotechnology industry.

A new keratinase producer, Bacillus sp. BK111, isolated from a poultry feather 
was identified as Bacillus zhangzhouensis, which is the first report for its 
keratinolytic activity. The keratinase production was optimized, followed by the 
enzyme purification and characterization using biochemical assays. A 2.34-fold 
increase was observed in the enzyme production under optimized conditions. The 
enzyme was characterized as a serine protease with 42 kDa molecular weight, 
stable in a wide range of temperature and pH with maximum keratinolytic activity 
at 60 °C and pH 9.5. The enzyme had a wide range of different substrates with 
the best performance on the feather meal substrate. Metal ions of Ca2+, K+, Na+ 
and Mn2+ enhanced the enzyme activity. The enzyme showed a great deal of 
stability in the presence of ethanol, methanol, acetone, 2-propanol, dimethyl 
sulfoxide, Tween-80 and Triton X-100. Dithiothreitol (DTT), as a reducing agent, 
caused a twofold increase in keratinolytic activity. The half-life of the enzyme 
at optimum temperature was calculated to be 125 min and the ratio of 
keratinolytic:caseinolytic for the enzyme was 0.8. Our results showed the 
remarkable features of the enzyme that make it suitable for biotechnological 
usages.

The Na+/H+ antiporter, which appears to predominantly contribute to the 
alkaliphily of Bacillus halodurans C-125, was studied in an alkali-sensitive 
mutant of this strain and a transformant with restored alkaliphily. The 
alkali-sensitive mutant, strain 38154, which has lost the ability to grow above 
pH 9.5, was found to lack electrogenic Na+/H+ antiport activity driven by 
deltapsi (membrane potential, interior negative), and it showed defective 
regulation of intracellular pH under alkaline conditions. On the other hand, a 
transformant carrying a 2.0-kb DNA fragment from the parental genome that 
complemented this defect was able to maintain an intracellular pH lower than 
that of the external milieu, and it was found to have recovered the Na+/H+ 
antiport activity driven by deltapsi. Sequence analyses found that a 5.1-kb DNA 
region contained four open reading frames (ORF-1 to ORF-4). Direct sequencing of 
the corresponding region in mutant 38154 revealed a G-to-A substitution, which 
resulted in an amino acid substitution from Gly-393 to Arg in the putative ORF-1 
product. It has been recently found that a region homologous to the DNA fragment 
responsible for the alkaliphily of strain C-125 exists in the genomes of 
Bacillus subtilis, Sinorhizobium (Rhizobium) meliloti, and Staphylococcus 
aureus. These homologues are present as a cluster of seven ORFs in each case. 
The shaA gene product of B. subtilis shows significant similarity to the ORF-1 
product of strain C-125. Disruption of the shaA gene resulted in a decrease in 
Na+/H+ antiport activity, and growth of the shaA-disrupted strain was impaired 
when the external Na+ concentration was increased. We conclude that the shaA 
gene encodes a Na+/H+ antiporter, which plays an important role in extrusion of 
cytotoxic Na+.

Osmolytes are ubiquitous in the cell and play an important role in controlling 
protein stability under stress. The natural osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide 
(TMAO) is used by marine animals to counteract the effect of pressure 
denaturation at large depths. The molecular mechanism of TMAO stabilization 
against pressure and urea denaturation has been extensively studied, but unlike 
the case of other osmolytes, the ability of TMAO to protect proteins from high 
temperature has not been quantified. To reveal the effect of TMAO on folded and 
unfolded protein ensembles and the hydration shell at different temperatures, we 
study a mutant of the well-characterized, fast-folding model protein B (PRB). We 
carried out, in total, >190 μs all-atom simulations of thermal folding/unfolding 
of PRB at multiple temperatures and concentrations of TMAO. The simulations show 
increased thermal stability of PRB in the presence of TMAO. Partly structured, 
compact ensembles are favored over the unfolded state. TMAO forms two shells 
near the protein: an outer shell away from the protein surface has altered 
H-bond lifetimes of water molecules and increases hydration of the protein to 
help stabilize it; a less-populated inner shell with an opposite TMAO 
orientation closer to the protein surface binds exclusively to basic side 
chains. The cooperative cosolute effect of the inner and outer shell TMAO has a 
small number of TMAO molecules ""herding"" water molecules into two hydration 
shells at or near the protein surface. The stabilizing effect of TMAO on our 
protein saturates at 1 M despite higher TMAO solubility, so there may be little 
evolutionary pressure for extremophiles to produce higher intracellular TMAO 
concentrations, if true in general.

Proteases are universal in existence in all organisms and are needed for 
metabolic activities of the cell. Also, proteases are the paramount hydrolytic 
enzymes widely used in industrial sector accounting ~65% of the aggregate 
worldwide enzyme market. The market revenue of global protease sale is estimated 
to be $ 2.21 billion by 2021. Currently, a widening expectation of biotechnology 
sector necessitates the availability of robust protease with industrially 
suitable operative features. The commercially-compatible protease should show 
stability and altered specificity in organic solvents, and be economically as 
well as ecologically sustainable. The proteolytic halophilic and halotolerant 
microorganisms are a novel source of salt-stable proteases. Beside stable in the 
presence of significant amount of salt, the halo-proteases could occasionally 
display the polyextremophilic attributes like tolerance to alkaline pH, high 
temperature, and organic solvent tolerance etc. This review describes - 
halophilic/halotolerant proteolytic microorganisms as source of salt-stable 
protease, mechanisms of high salt tolerance, various physical and nutritional 
parameters affecting the protease production, purification strategies for 
protease, characteristics of salt-stable proteases, and commercial significance 
of salt-stable proteases. The study revises the current status of the research 
on salt-stable proteases obtained from extremophile with their operative utility 
in the biotechnology field.

Liquid water is a requirement for biochemistry, yet under some circumstances it 
is deleterious to life. Here, we show that liquid water reduces the upper 
temperature survival limit for two extremophilic photosynthetic microorganisms 
(Gloeocapsa and Chroococcidiopsis spp.) by greater than 40°C under hydrated 
conditions compared to desiccated conditions. Under hydrated conditions, thermal 
stress causes protein inactivation as shown by the fluorescein diacetate assay. 
The presence of water was also found to enhance the deleterious effects of 
freeze-thaw in Chroococcidiopsis sp. In the presence of water, short-wavelength 
UV radiation more effectively kills Gloeocapsa sp. colonies, which we 
hypothesize is caused by factors including the greater penetration of UV 
radiation into hydrated colonies compared to desiccated colonies. The data 
predict that deserts where maximum thermal stress or irradiation occurs in 
conjunction with the presence of liquid water may be less habitable to some 
organisms than more extreme arid deserts where organisms can dehydrate prior to 
being exposed to these extremes, thus minimizing thermal and radiation damage. 
Life in extreme deserts is poised between the deleterious effects of the 
presence and the lack of liquid water. Key Words: 
Deserts-Extremophiles-Stress-High temperatures-UV radiation-Desiccation.

Alkaline soda lakes are unique habitats found in specific geographic regions, 
usually with dry climate. The Carpathian Basin is one of those regions very 
important for habitat and biodiversity conservation in Europe, with natural soda 
lakes found in Austria, Hungary and Serbia. In comparison to other two countries 
from Central Europe, algal biodiversity studies of saline soda lakes in Serbia 
are scarce. Lake Velika Rusanda has the highest measured salinity of all saline 
lakes in the Carpathian Basin and there were no reports of its diatom species 
richness and diversity till now. We conducted 2-year investigation programme to 
study biodiversity and seasonal dynamics of diatoms in this lake. A total of 27 
diatom taxa were found, almost all of them attached to reed and much less in 
benthos and plankton. Five new diatom species for Serbia were recorded, 
Craticula halopannonica, Navicymbula pusilla, Hantzschia weyprechtii, Nitzschia 
thermaloides and Navicula staffordiae. The last mentioned is new for Europe as 
well. Lake Velika Rusanda is inhabited mostly by alkaliphilous and halophilic 
diatoms. Since diatoms are used as bioindicators in soda lakes, our results will 
improve their further application in ecological status assessment of these 
fragile habitats in the Carpathian Basin.

An anaerobic, hydrogenotrophic methane-producing archaeon was isolated from an 
alkaline thermal spring (42 °C, pH 9.0) in New Caledonia. This methanogen, 
designated strain CANT, is alkaliphilic, thermotolerant, with Gram-positive 
staining non-motile cells. Strain CANT grows autotrophically using hydrogen 
exclusively as an energy source and carbon dioxide as the sole carbon source 
(without the requirement of yeast extract or other organic compounds). It grows 
at 20-45 °C (optimum, 45 °C) and pH 7.3-9.7 (optimum, pH 9.0). NaCl is not 
required for growth (optimum 0 %) but is tolerated up to 1.5 %. It resists 
novobiocin, streptomycin and vancomycin but is inhibited by ampicillin and 
penicillin, among other antibiotics. The genome consists of a circular 
chromosome (2.2 Mb) containing 2126 predicted protein-encoding genes with a G+C 
content of 36.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence 
indicated that strain CANT is a member of the genus Methanobacterium, most 
closely related to the alkaliphilic Methanobacterium alcaliphilum WeN4T with 
98.5 % 16S rRNA gene sequence identity. The genomes of strain CANT and M. 
alcaliphilum DSM 3459, sequenced in this study, share 71.6 % average nucleotide 
identity and 14.0 % digital DNA-DNA hybridization. Therefore, phylogenetic and 
physiological results indicate that strain CANT represents a novel species, for 
which the name Methanobacterium alkalithermotolerans sp. nov. is proposed, and 
strain CANT (=DSM 102889T= JCM 31304T) is assigned as the type strain.

Extreme environments, such as deserts and high-elevation ecosystems, are very 
important from biodiversity and ecological perspectives. However, plant 
physiology at those sites has been scarcely studied, likely due to logistic 
difficulties. In the present study, leaf physiological traits in native plants 
were analyzed from arid zones across an elevational transect in Western China, 
from Turpan Basin to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) at Delingha. The aim of 
this study was to use leaf physiological traits to help identifying potentially 
threatened species and true extremophiles. Physiological measurements in the 
field, and particularly in situ measurements of gas exchange and chlorophyll 
fluorescence, have been determined to be useful to determine the current state 
of plants at a given environment. Using this approach plus a combination of leaf 
traits, several species performing particularly well at the QTP were identified, 
e.g. Hedysarum multijugum, as well as at Manas drylands, e.g. Peganum harmala 
and Setaria viridis. On the other hand, several species showed marked signs of 
severe stress, in particular a very low photosynthetic rate over its potential 
maximum, as well as other negative traits, like low water and/or 
nitrogen-use-efficiency, which should be considered in conservation plans. 
Interestingly, all C4 species studied except Setaria viridis were among the most 
stressed species. Despite their higher water use efficiency and 
drought-tolerance reputation, they presented a much larger photosynthesis 
depression than most C3 species. This is an intriguing and interesting 
observation that deserves further studies.

After chloroform fumigating an arable soil, the relative abundance of phylotypes 
belonging to only two phyla (Actinobacteria and Firmicutes) and two orders 
[Actinomycetales and Bacillales (mostly Bacillus)] increased in a subsequent 
aerobic incubation, while it decreased for a wide range of bacterial groups. It 
remained to be seen if similar bacterial groups were affected when an extreme 
alkaline saline soil was fumigated. Soil with electrolytic conductivity between 
139 and 157 dS m(-1), and pH 10.0 and 10.3 was fumigated and the bacterial 
community structure determined after 0, 1, 5 and 10 days by analysis of the 16S 
rRNA gene, while an unfumigated soil served as control. The relative abundance 
of the Firmicutes increased in the fumigated soil (52.8%) compared to the 
unfumigated soil (34.2%), while that of the Bacteroidetes decreased from 16.2% 
in the unfumigated soil to 8.8% in the fumigated soil. Fumigation increased the 
relative abundance of the genus Bacillus from 14.7% in the unfumigated soil to 
25.7%. It was found that phylotypes belonging to the Firmicutes, mostly of the 
genus Bacillus, were dominant in colonizing the fumigated alkaline saline as 
found in the arable soil, while the relative abundance of a wide range of 
bacterial groups decreased.

The adaptation mechanisms of microbial communities to natural perturbations 
remain unexplored, particularly in extreme environments. The extremophilic 
communities of halite (NaCl) nodules from the hyper-arid core of the Atacama 
Desert are self-sustained and represent a unique opportunity to study functional 
adaptations and community dynamics with changing environmental conditions. We 
transplanted halite nodules to different sites in the desert and investigated 
how their taxonomic, cellular, and biochemical changes correlated with water 
availability, using environmental data modeling and metagenomic analyses. 
Salt-in strategists, mainly represented by haloarchaea, significantly increased 
in relative abundance at sites characterized by extreme dryness, multiple 
wet/dry cycles, and colder conditions. The functional analysis of 
metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) revealed site-specific enrichments in 
archaeal MAGs encoding for the uptake of various compatible solutes and for 
glycerol utilization. These findings suggest that opportunistic salt-in 
strategists took over the halite communities at the driest sites. They most 
likely benefited from compounds newly released in the environment by the death 
of microorganisms least adapted to the new conditions. The observed changes were 
consistent with the need to maximize cellular bioenergetics when confronted with 
lower water availability and higher salinity, providing valuable information on 
microbial community adaptations and resilience to climate change.

Natural cold or alkaline environments are common on Earth. A rare combination of 
these two extremes is found in the permanently cold (less than 6 °C) and 
alkaline (pH above 10) ikaite columns in the Ikka Fjord in Southern Greenland. 
Bioprospecting efforts have established the ikaite columns as a source of 
bacteria and enzymes adapted to these conditions. They have also highlighted the 
limitations of cultivation-based methods in this extreme environment and 
metagenomic approaches may provide access to novel extremophilic enzymes from 
the uncultured majority of bacteria. Here, we describe the construction and 
screening of a metagenomic library of the prokaryotic community inhabiting the 
ikaite columns.

Alkaliphilic bacteria typically grow well at pH 9, with the most extremophilic 
strains growing up to pH values as high as pH 12-13. Interest in extreme 
alkaliphiles arises because they are sources of useful, stable enzymes, and the 
cells themselves can be used for biotechnological and other applications at high 
pH. In addition, alkaline hydrothermal vents represent an early evolutionary 
niche for alkaliphiles and novel extreme alkaliphiles have also recently been 
found in alkaline serpentinizing sites. A third focus of interest in 
alkaliphiles is the challenge raised by the use of proton-coupled ATP synthases 
for oxidative phosphorylation by non-fermentative alkaliphiles. This creates a 
problem with respect to tenets of the chemiosmotic model that remains the core 
model for the bioenergetics of oxidative phosphorylation. Each of these facets 
of alkaliphilic bacteria will be discussed with a focus on extremely 
alkaliphilic Bacillus strains. These alkaliphilic bacteria have provided a 
cogent experimental system to probe adaptations that enable their growth and 
oxidative phosphorylation at high pH. Adaptations are clearly needed to enable 
secreted or partially exposed enzymes or protein complexes to function at the 
high external pH. Also, alkaliphiles must maintain a cytoplasmic pH that is 
significantly lower than the pH of the outside medium. This protects cytoplasmic 
components from an external pH that is alkaline enough to impair their stability 
or function. However, the pH gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane, with its 
orientation of more acidic inside than outside, is in the reverse of the 
productive orientation for bioenergetic work. The reversed gradient reduces the 
trans-membrane proton-motive force available to energize ATP synthesis. Multiple 
strategies are hypothesized to be involved in enabling alkaliphiles to 
circumvent the challenge of a low bulk proton-motive force energizing 
proton-coupled ATP synthesis at high pH.

An endo β-1,4-xylanase (XynE15) from a culture broth of a deep subseafloor 
microorganism, Microcella alkaliphila JAM-AC0309, was purified to homogeneity. 
The molecular mass of XynE15 was approximately 150 kDa as judged by SDS-PAGE. 
The optimal pH and temperature for hydrolysis of xylan were pH 8 and 65 °C. The 
enzyme was stable to incubation for 30 min at up to 75 °C, and the half-life at 
50 °C was 48 h. XynE15 hydrolyzed arabinoxylan, oat spelt xylan, and birchwood 
xylan well, but not avicel, carboxymethylcellulose, or arabinan. 
Xylooligosaccharides were hydrolyzed to mainly xylobiose from higher than 
xylotetraose. The genome sequencing analysis of strain JAM-AC03039 revealed that 
XynE15 was composed of 1,319 amino acids with one catalytic domain and three 
carbohydrate-binding domains belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10 and 
carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) family 4, respectively.

This review describes the main natural extreme environments, characterized by 
high temperature, high and low pH and high salinity, that can be colonized by 
microorganisms. The environments covered are: freshwater alkaline hot springs; 
acidic solfatara fields; anaerobic geothermal mud and soils; acidic sulphur and 
pyrite areas; carbonate springs and alkaline soil; and soda and highly saline 
lakes. The community structure, in terms of available energy sources and 
representative autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms, is discussed for 
each type of habitat.

Halomonas alkalicola CICC 11012s is an alkaliphilic and halotolerant bacterium 
isolated from a soap-making tank (pH > 10) from a household-product plant. This 
strain can propagate at pH 12.5, which is fatal to most bacteria. Genomic 
analysis revealed that the genome size was 3,511,738 bp and contained 3295 
protein-coding genes, including a complete cell wall and plasma membrane lipid 
biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore, four putative Na+/H+ and K+/H+ antiporter 
genes, or gene clusters, designated as HaNhaD, HaNhaP, HaMrp and HaPha, were 
identified within the genome. Heterologous expression of these genes in 
antiporter-deficient Escherichia coli indicated that HaNhaD, an Na+/H+ 
antiporter, played a dominant role in Na+ tolerance and pH homeostasis in 
acidic, neutral and alkaline environments. In addition, HaMrp exhibited Na+ 
tolerance; however, it functioned mainly in alkaline conditions. Both HaNhaP and 
HaPha were identified as K+/H+ antiporters that played an important role in high 
alkalinity and salinity. In summary, genome analysis and heterologous expression 
experiments demonstrated that a complete set of adaptive strategies have been 
developed by the double extremophilic strain CICC 11012s in response to 
alkalinity and salinity. Specifically, four antiporters exhibiting different 
physiological roles for different situations worked together to support the 
strain in harsh surroundings.

Zoosporic true fungi are thought to be ubiquitous in many ecosystems, especially 
in cool, moist soils and freshwater habitats which are rich in organic matter. 
However, some of the habitats where these fungi are found may periodically 
experience extreme conditions, such as soils in extremely dry, hot and cold 
climates, acidic and alkaline soils, polluted rivers, anaerobic soil and water, 
saline soil and water, periglacial soils, oligotrophic soils, tree canopies and 
hydrothermal vents. It is clear that many ecotypes of zoosporic true fungi have 
indeed adapted to extreme or stressful environmental conditions. This conclusion 
is supported by studies in both the field and in the laboratory. Therefore, in 
our opinion, at least some true zoosporic fungi can be considered to be 
extremophiles.

Water activity is an important characteristic for describing unusual waters and 
is a determinant of habitability for microorganisms. However, few empirical 
studies of water activity have been done for natural waters exhibiting an 
extreme chemistry. Here, we investigate water activity for acid brines from 
Western Australia and Chile with pH as low as 1.4, salinities as high as 32% 
total dissolved solids, and complex chemical compositions. These acid brines 
host diverse communities of extremophilic microorganisms, including archaea, 
bacteria, algae, and fungi, according to metagenomic analyses. For the most 
extreme brine, its water activity (0.714) was considerably lower than that of 
saturated (pure) NaCl brine. This study provides a thermodynamic insight into 
life within end-member natural waters that lie at, or possibly beyond, the very 
edge of habitable space on Earth.

BACKGROUND: During the kraft process to obtain cellulosic pulp from wood, most 
of the lignin is removed by high-temperature alkaline cooking, released in the 
black liquors and usually incinerated for energy. However, kraft lignins are a 
valuable source of phenolic compounds that can be valorized in new bio-based 
products. The aim of this work is to develop laccases capable of working under 
the extreme conditions of high temperature and pH, typical of the industrial 
conversion of wood into kraft pulp and fibreboard, in order to provide 
extremophilic biocatalysts for depolymerising kraft lignin, and enzyme-assisted 
technologies for kraft pulp and fibreboard production.
RESULTS: Through systematic enzyme engineering, combining enzyme-directed 
evolution and rational design, we changed the optimal pH of the laccase for 
oxidation of lignin phenols from acidic to basic, enhanced the catalytic 
activity at alkaline pH and increased the thermal tolerance of the enzyme by 
accumulating up to eight mutations in the protein sequence. The extremophilic 
laccase variants show maximum activity at 70 °C and oxidize kraft lignin at pH 
10. Their integration into industrial-type processes saves energy and chemicals. 
As a pre-bleaching stage, the enzymes promote kraft pulp bleachability and 
significantly reduce the need for chlorine dioxide compared to the industrial 
sequence. Their application in wood chips during fibreboard production, 
facilitates the defibering stage, with less energy required.
CONCLUSIONS: A set of new alkaliphilic and thermophilic fungal laccases has been 
developed to operate under the extreme conditions of high temperature and pH 
typical of industrial wood conversion processes. For the first time 
basidiomycete laccases of high-redox potential show activity on lignin-derived 
phenols and polymeric lignin at pH 10. Considering the extreme conditions of 
current industrial processes for kraft pulp and fibreboard production, the new 
tailor-made laccases constitute a step forward towards turning kraft pulp mills 
into biorefineries. Their use as biocatalysts in the wood conversion sector is 
expected to support the development of more environmentally sound and efficient 
processes, and more sustainable products.

Large numbers of magnetotactic bacteria were discovered in mud and water samples 
collected from a number of highly alkaline aquatic environments with pH values 
of ≈ 9.5. These bacteria were helical in morphology and biomineralized chains of 
bullet-shaped crystals of magnetite and were present in all the highly alkaline 
sites sampled. Three strains from different sites were isolated and cultured and 
grew optimally at pH 9.0-9.5 but not at 8.0 and below, demonstrating that these 
organisms truly require highly alkaline conditions and are not simply 
surviving/growing in neutral pH micro-niches in their natural habitats. All 
strains grew anaerobically through the reduction of sulfate as a terminal 
electron acceptor and phylogenetic analysis, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, 
as well as some physiological features, showed that they could represent strains 
of Desulfonatronum thiodismutans, a known alkaliphilic bacterium that does not 
biomineralize magnetosomes. Our results show that some magnetotactic bacteria 
can be considered extremophilic and greatly extend the known ecology of 
magnetotactic bacteria and the conditions under which they can biomineralize 
magnetite. Moreover, our results show that this type of magnetotactic bacterium 
is common in highly alkaline environments. Our findings also greatly influence 
the interpretation of the presence of nanometer-sized magnetite crystals, 
so-called magnetofossils, in highly alkaline environments.

The true-branching heterocystous cyanobacterium Fischerella sp. FS 18 is widely 
distributed in paddy fields (North) and petroleum polluted soils (South) in 
Iran. This investigation tested the hypothesis that the cyanobacterium can 
acclimatize under the combined effect of extreme environmental conditions. Here, 
we analysed the physiological response of the cyanobacterium under extremely 
limited irradiance (2 μmol photon m-2 s-1); limited carbon dioxide concentration 
(no aeration) at alkaline pHs (9 and 11) for up to 96 h. When the cyanobacterium 
was exposed to these extreme conditions at pH 11, we observed a decline in 
growth, oxygen liberation, photosystems ratio, chlorophyll a, and phycobilisomes 
activity compared to pH 9 after 24 h. Besides, we registered a significant 
decrease in maximum photochemical efficiency and activity of photosystem II at 
pH 11. The comparative single-cell study revealed that pH 9 caused higher 
efficiency of photosystem II and I, while increasing alkalinity pH 11 led to 
disturbed phycobilisomes activity after 24 h. This strain was able to recover 
its structures after 96 h. In addition, spectroscopy analyses revealed the 
presence of the Mycosporine-like amino acid at pH 9.

Canavalia rosea (bay bean), distributing in coastal areas or islands in tropical 
and subtropical regions, is an extremophile halophyte with good adaptability to 
seawater and drought. Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins typically 
accumulate in response to various abiotic stresses, including dehydration, 
salinity, high temperature, and cold, or during the late stage of seed 
development. Abscisic acid-, stress-, and ripening-induced (ASR) genes are 
stress and developmentally regulated plant-specific genes. In this study, we 
reported the first comprehensive survey of the LEA and ASR gene superfamily in 
C. rosea. A total of 84 CrLEAs and three CrASRs were identified in C. rosea and 
classified into nine groups. All CrLEAs and CrASRs harbored the conserved motif 
for their family proteins. Our results revealed that the CrLEA genes were widely 
distributed in different chromosomes, and all of the CrLEA/CrASR genes showed 
wide expression features in different tissues in C. rosea plants. Additionally, 
we introduced 10 genes from different groups into yeast to assess the functions 
of the CrLEAs/CrASRs. These results contribute to our understanding of LEA/ASR 
genes from halophytes and provide robust candidate genes for functional 
investigations in plant species adapted to extreme environments.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) such as stroke, high blood pressure, 
peripheral vascular disease, ischemic heart disease and acute myocardial 
infarction are some of the leading causes of death. To treat CVDs, commercially 
available thrombolytic agents are widely used. However, these thrombolytic 
agents have various side effects. Alternatively, fibrinolytic enzymes from 
bacterial sources are highly safe and have direct blood clot lytic activity.
METHODS: A fibrinolytic enzyme producing bacterial strain, Bacillus flexus BF12, 
was isolated from a solar saltpan in Kanyakumari District, Tamilnadu, India. 
Enzyme production was improved by optimizing physical factors and nutritional 
factors.
RESULTS: A novel fibrinolytic enzyme was isolated from a strain of the studied 
B. flexus BF12. Enzyme production was enhanced significantly by optimizing 
process parameters. The critical physical factors (pH and salinity) and 
influencing nutritional factors (carbon, nitrogen and ions) were optimized by 
one variable at a time approach, followed by the statistical method. The strain 
BF12 was highly active at alkaline pH (>7.0) and between 4 and 6% NaCl 
concentration. The nutrients such as fructose (carbon source), beef extract 
(nitrogen source) and CaCl2 significantly influenced enzyme production. Central 
composite design and response surface methodology improved 3.2-fold enzyme yield 
than unoptimized culture medium. Fibrinolytic protease was purified by ammonium 
sulphate precipitation, dialysis and gel filtration chromatography.
DISCUSSION: The molecular weight of an enzyme was found to be 23 kDa. It was 
active at a broad temperature (40-60 °C) and pH (7.0-9.0) ranges. Enzyme 
activity was enhanced by Ca2+ and Co2+ ions. The purified protease retained 100% 
enzyme activity in the presence of ethanol and acetone. Acetonitrile, butanol, 
DMSO, methanol and chloroform showed enzyme activity of 63%, 92.5%, 94.7%, 92.3% 
and 90.4%, respectively. The purified enzyme degraded 100% of human blood clot.
CONCLUSION: The Bacillus flexus BF12 fibrinolytic enzyme shows promising 
potentials in nutraceutical and food fortification applications. The application 
of fibrinolytic enzymes could prevent CVDs.

Alkaliphilic Bacillus species that are isolated from nonmarine, moderate salt, 
and moderate temperature environments offer the opportunity to explore 
strategies that have developed for solving the energetic challenges of aerobic 
growth at pH values between 10 and 11. Such bacteria share many structural, 
metabolic, genomic, and regulatory features with nonextremophilic species such 
as Bacillus subtilis. Comparative studies can therefore illuminate the specific 
features of gene organization and special features of gene products that are 
homologs of those found in non-extremophiles, and potentially identify novel 
gene products of importance in alkaliphily. We have focused our studies on the 
facultative alkaliphile Bacillus firmus OF4, which is routinely grown on 
malate-containing medium at either pH 7.5 or 10.5. Current work is directed 
toward clarification of the characteristics and energetics of 
membrane-associated proteins that must catalyze inward proton movements. One 
group of such proteins are the Na+/H+ antiporters that enable cells to adapt to 
a sudden upward shift in pH and to maintain a cytoplasmic pH that is 2-2.3 units 
below the external pH in the most alkaline range of pH for growth. Another is 
the proton-translocating ATP synthase that catalyzes robust production of ATP 
under conditions in which the external proton concentration and the bulk 
chemiosmotic driving force are low. Three gene loci that are candidates for 
Na+/H+ antiporter encoding genes with roles in Na(+)-dependent pH homeostasis 
have been identified. All of them have homologs in B. subtilis, in which pH 
homeostasis can be carried out with either K+ or Na+. The physiological 
importance of one of the B. firmus OF4 loci, nhaC, has been studied by targeted 
gene disruption, and the same approach is being extended to the others. The atp 
genes that encode the alkaliphile's F1F0-ATP synthase are found to have 
interesting motifs in areas of putative importance for proton translocation. As 
an initial step in studies that will probe the importance and possible roles of 
these motifs, the entire atp operon from B. firmus OF4 has been cloned and 
functionally expressed in an Escherichia coli mutant that has a full deletion of 
its atp genes. The transformant does not exhibit growth on succinate, but shows 
reproducible, modest increases in the aerobic growth yields on glucose as well 
as membrane ATPase activity that exhibits characteristics of the alkaliphile 
enzyme.

The microbial degradation of lignocellulose in natural ecosystems presents 
numerous biotechnological opportunities, including biofuel production from 
agricultural waste and feedstock biomass. To explore the degradation potential 
of specific thermophiles, we have identified and characterized extremophilic 
microorganisms isolated from hot springs environments that are capable of 
biodegrading lignin and cellulose substrates under thermoalkaline conditions, 
using a combination of culturing, genomics, and metabolomics techniques. 
Organisms that can use lignin and cellulose as a sole carbon source at 60 to 
75°C were isolated from sediment slurry of thermoalkaline hot springs (71 to 
81°C and pH 8 to 9) of Yellowstone National Park. Full-length 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing indicated that these isolates were closely related to Geobacillus 
thermoleovorans. Interestingly, most of these isolates demonstrated biofilm 
formation on lignin, a phenotype that is correlated with increased 
bioconversion. Assessment of metabolite level changes in two Geobacillus 
isolates from two representative springs were undertaken to characterize the 
metabolic responses associated with growth on glucose versus lignin carbon 
source as a function of pH and temperature. Overall, results from this study 
support that thermoalkaline springs harbor G. thermoleovorans microorganisms 
with lignocellulosic biomass degradation capabilities and potential downstream 
biotechnological applications. IMPORTANCE Since lignocellulosic biomass 
represents a major agro-industrial waste and renewable resource, its potential 
to replace nonrenewable petroleum-based products for energy production is 
considerable. Microbial ligninolytic and cellulolytic enzymes are of high 
interest in biorefineries for the valorization of lignocellulosic biomass, as 
they can withstand the extreme conditions (e.g., high temperature and high pH) 
required for processing. Of great interest is the ligninolytic potential of 
specific Geobacillus thermoleovorans isolates to function at a broad range of pH 
and temperatures, since lignin is the bottleneck in the bioprocessing of 
lignocellulose. In this study, results obtained from G. thermoleovorans isolates 
originating from YNP springs are significant because very few microorganisms 
from alkaline thermal environments have been discovered to have lignin- and 
cellulose-biodegrading capabilities, and this work opens new avenues for the 
biotechnological valorization of lignocellulosic biomass at an industrial scale.

Biocatalytic decolorization of azo dyes is hampered by their recalcitrance and 
the characteristics of textile effluents. Alkaline pH and heavy metals present 
in colored wastewaters generally limit the activity of enzymes such as laccases 
of fungal origin; this has led to an increasing interest in bacterial laccases. 
In this work, the dye decolorization ability of LAC_2.9, a laccase from the 
thermophilic bacterial strain Thermus sp. 2.9, was investigated. Its resistance 
towards different pHs and toxic heavy metals frequently present in wastewaters 
was also characterized. LAC_2.9 was active and highly stable in the pH range of 
5.0 to 9.0. Even at 100 mM Cd+2, As+5 and Ni+2 LAC_2.9 retained 99%, 86% and 75% 
of its activity, respectively. LAC_2.9 was capable of decolorizing 98% of 
Xylidine, 54% of RBBR, 40% of Gentian Violet, and 33% of Methyl Orange after 
24 h incubation at pH 9, at 60 °C, without the addition of redox mediators. At 
acidic pH, the presence of the mediator 1-hydroxybenzotriazole generally 
increased the catalytic effectiveness. We analyzed the degradation products of 
laccase-treated Xylidine and Methyl Orange by capillary electrophoresis and mass 
spectrometry, and propose a degradation pathway for these dyes. For its ability 
to decolorize recalcitrant dyes, at pH 9, and its stability under the tested 
conditions, LAC_2.9 could be effectively used to decolorize azo dyes in alkaline 
and heavy metal containing effluents.

Exposure of protein modified surfaces to air may be necessary in several 
applications. For example, air contact may be inevitable during the implantation 
of biomedical devices, for analysis of protein modified surfaces, or for sensor 
applications. Protein coatings are very sensitive to dehydration and can undergo 
significant and irreversible alterations of their conformations upon exposure to 
air. With the use of two compatible solutes from extremophilic bacteria, ectoine 
and hydroxyectoine, the authors were able to preserve the activity of dried 
protein monolayers for up to >24 h. The protective effect can be explained by 
the preferred exclusion model; i.e., the solutes trap a thin water layer around 
the protein, retaining an aqueous environment and preventing unfolding of the 
protein. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) immobilized on compact TiO2 was used as a 
model system. Structural differences between the compatible solute stabilized 
and unstabilized protein films, and between different solutes, were analyzed by 
static time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The biological 
activity difference observed in a colorimetric activity assay was correlated to 
changes in protein conformation by application of principal component analysis 
to the static ToF-SIMS data. Additionally, rehydration of the denatured HRP was 
observed in ToF-SIMS with an exposure of denatured protein coatings to ectoine 
and hydroxyectoine solutions.

Beside sodium chloride, inland saline aquatic systems often contain other anions 
than chloride such as hydrogen carbonate and sulfate. Our understanding of the 
biological effects of salt composition diversity is limited; therefore, the aim 
of this study was to examine the effect of different anions on the growth of 
halophilic bacteria. Accordingly, the salt composition and concentration 
preference of 172 strains isolated from saline and soda lakes that differed in 
ionic composition was tested using media containing either carbonate, chloride 
or sulfate as anion in concentration values ranging from 0 to 0.40 mol/L. 
Differences in salt-type preference among bacterial strains were observed in 
relationship to the salt composition of the natural habitat they were isolated 
from indicating specific salt-type adaptation. Sodium carbonate represented the 
strongest selective force, while majority of strains was well-adapted to growth 
even at high concentrations of sodium sulfate. Salt preference was to some 
extent associated with taxonomy, although variations even within the same 
bacterial species were also identified. Our results suggest that the extent of 
the effect of dissolved salts in saline lakes is not limited to their 
concentration but the type of anion also substantially impacts the growth and 
survival of individual microorganisms.

Balneotherapeutic water springs, such as those with thermal, saline, sulfur, or 
any other characteristics, have recently been the subject of phylogenetic 
studies with a closer focus on the description and/or isolation of 
phylogenetically novel or biotechnologically interesting microorganisms. 
Generally, however, most such microorganisms are rarely obtained in pure culture 
or are even, for now, unculturable under laboratory conditions. In this 
culture-dependent study of radioactive water springs of Jáchymov (Joachimstahl), 
Czech Republic, we investigated a combination of classical cultivation 
approaches with those imitating sampling source conditions. Using these 
environmentally relevant cultivation approaches, over 1,000 pure cultures were 
successfully isolated from 4 radioactive springs. Subsequent dereplication 
yielded 121 unique taxonomic units spanning 44 genera and 9 taxonomic classes, 
~10% of which were identified as hitherto undescribed taxa. Genomes of the 
latter were sequenced and analyzed, with a special focus on endogenous defense 
systems to withstand oxidative stress and aid in radiotolerance. Due to their 
origin from radioactive waters, we determined the resistance of the isolates to 
oxidative stress. Most of the isolates were more resistant to menadione than the 
model strain Deinococcus radiodurans DSM 20539T. Moreover, isolates of the 
Deinococcacecae, Micrococcaceae, Bacillaceae, Moraxellaceae, and 
Pseudomonadaceae families even exhibited higher resistance in the presence of 
hydrogen peroxide. In summary, our culturomic analysis shows that subsurface 
water springs contain diverse bacterial populations, including 
as-yet-undescribed taxa and strains with promising biotechnological potential. 
Furthermore, this study suggests that environmentally relevant cultivation 
techniques increase the efficiency of cultivation, thus enhancing the chance of 
isolating hitherto uncultured microorganisms. IMPORTANCE The mine Svornost in 
Jáchymov (Joachimstahl), Czech Republic is a former silver-uranium mine and the 
world's first and for a long time only radium mine, nowadays the deepest mine 
devoted to the extraction of water which is saturated with radon and has 
therapeutic benefits given its chemical properties. This healing water, which is 
approximately 13 thousand years old, is used under medical supervision for the 
treatment of patients with neurological and rheumatic disorders. Our culturomic 
approach using low concentrations of growth substrates or the environmental 
matrix itself (i.e., water filtrate) in culturing media combined with prolonged 
cultivation time resulted in the isolation of a broad spectrum of microorganisms 
from 4 radioactive springs of Jáchymov which are phylogenetically novel and/or 
bear various adaptive or coping mechanisms to thrive under selective pressure 
and can thus provide a wide spectrum of capabilities potentially exploitable in 
diverse scientific, biotechnological, or medical disciplines.

Life in extreme environments is typically studied as a physiological problem, 
although the existence of extremophilic animals suggests that developmental and 
behavioral traits might also be adaptive in such environments. Here, we describe 
a new species of nematode, Tokorhabditis tufae, n. gen., n. sp., which was 
discovered from the alkaline, hypersaline, and arsenic-rich locale of Mono Lake, 
California. The new species, which offers a tractable model for studying 
animal-specific adaptations to extremophilic life, shows a combination of 
unusual reproductive and developmental traits. Like the recently described 
sister group Auanema, the species has a trioecious mating system comprising 
males, females, and self-fertilizing hermaphrodites. Our description of the new 
genus thus reveals that the origin of this uncommon reproductive mode is even 
more ancient than previously assumed, and it presents a new comparator for the 
study of mating-system transitions. However, unlike Auanema and almost all other 
known rhabditid nematodes, the new species is obligately live-bearing, with 
embryos that grow in utero, suggesting maternal provisioning during development. 
Finally, our isolation of two additional, molecularly distinct strains of the 
new genus-specifically from non-extreme locales-establishes a comparative system 
for the study of extremophilic traits in this model.

An alkali and salt-tolerating strain FJAT-44876T was isolated from the bauxite 
residue sample. The 16S rRNA gene sequence and phylogenetic analysis suggest 
that strain FJAT-44876T was a member of the genus Evansella. It grew at 15-45 ℃ 
(optimum 20-25 ℃) and pH 6.5-11.0 (optimum pH 8.0-9.0) with 0-20% (w/v) NaCl 
(optimum 6-8%). The major fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0, iso-C15:0, 
anteiso-C17:0, iso-C17:0, and C16:0. The cell wall peptidoglycan contained 
meso-diaminopimelic acid and MK-7 as the menaquinone. The major polar lipids 
were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, 
phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylglycerol. The genomic DNA G+C content 
was 38.2%. The average nucleotide identity values between strain FJAT-44876T and 
closely related members were below the cutoff level for species delineation. 
Thus, based on the above results, strain FJAT-44876T represents a novel species 
of the genus Evansella, for which the name Evansella halocellulosilytica sp. 
nov., is proposed. The type strain is FJAT-44876T (=CCTCC AB 2016264T = DSM 
104633T).

Extremophiles produce macromolecules which inhibit ice recrystallization, but 
there is increasing interest in discovering and developing small molecules that 
can modulate ice growth. Realizing their potential requires an understanding of 
how these molecules function at the atomistic level. Here, we report the 
discovery that the amino acid l-α-alanine demonstrates ice recrystallization 
inhibition (IRI) activity, functioning at 100 mM (∼10 mg/mL). We combined 
experimental assays with molecular simulations to investigate this IRI agent, 
drawing comparison to β-alanine, an isomer of l-α-alanine which displays no IRI 
activity. We found that the difference in the IRI activity of these molecules 
does not originate from their ice binding affinity, but from their capacity to 
(not) become overgrown, dictated by the degree of structural (in)compatibility 
within the growing ice lattice. These findings shed new light on the microscopic 
mechanisms of small molecule cryoprotectants, particularly in terms of their 
molecular structure and overgrowth by ice.

This work reports detailed characteristics of the antimicrobial peptide 
Intestinalin (P30), which is derived from the LysC enzyme of Clostridium 
intestinale strain URNW. The peptide shows a broader antibacterial spectrum than 
the parental enzyme, showing potent antimicrobial activity against clinical 
strains of Gram-positive staphylococci and Gram-negative pathogens and causing 
between 3.04 ± 0.12 log kill for Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and 7.10 ± 0.05 log 
kill for multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii KPD 581 at a 5 μM 
concentration. Moreover, Intestinalin (P30) prevents biofilm formation and 
destroys 24-h and 72-h biofilms formed by Acinetobacter baumannii CRAB KPD 205 
(reduction levels of 4.28 and 2.62 log CFU/mL, respectively). The activity of 
Intestinalin is combined with both no cytotoxicity and little hemolytic effect 
against mammalian cells. The nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular dynamics 
(MD) data show a high tendency of Intestinalin to interact with the bacterial 
phospholipid cell membrane. Although positively charged, Intestinalin resides in 
the membrane and aggregates into small oligomers. Negatively charged 
phospholipids stabilize peptide oligomers to form water- and ion-permeable 
pores, disrupting the integrity of bacterial cell membranes. Experimental data 
showed that Intestinalin interacts with negatively charged lipoteichoic acid 
(logK based on isothermal titration calorimetry, 7.45 ± 0.44), causes membrane 
depolarization, and affects membrane integrity by forming large pores, all of 
which result in loss of bacterial viability. IMPORTANCE Antibiotic resistance is 
rising rapidly among pathogenic bacteria, becoming a global public health 
problem that threatens the effectiveness of therapies for many infectious 
diseases. In this respect, antimicrobial peptides appear to be an interesting 
alternative to combat bacterial pathogens. Here, we report the characteristics 
of an antimicrobial peptide (of 30 amino acids) derived from the clostridial 
LysC enzyme. The peptide showed killing activity against clinical strains of 
Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Experimental data and computational 
modeling showed that this peptide forms transmembrane pores, directly engaging 
the negatively charged phospholipids of the bacterial cell membrane. 
Consequently, dissipation of the electrochemical gradient across cell membranes 
affects many vital processes, such as ATP synthesis, motility, and transport of 
nutrients. This kind of dysfunction leads to the loss of bacterial viability. 
Our firm conviction is that the presented study will be a helpful resource in 
searching for novel antimicrobial peptides that could have the potential to 
replace conventional antibiotics.

Proteomics has greatly advanced the understanding of the cellular biochemistry 
of microorganisms. The thermoalkaliphile Caldalkalibacillus thermarum TA2.A1 is 
an organism of interest for studies into how alkaliphiles adapt to their extreme 
lifestyles, as it can grow from pH 7.5 to pH 11. Within most classes of 
microbes, the membrane-bound electron transport chain (ETC) enables a great 
degree of adaptability and is a key part of metabolic adaptation. Knowing what 
membrane proteins are generally expressed is crucial as a benchmark for further 
studies. Unfortunately, membrane proteins are the category of proteins hardest 
to detect using conventional cellular proteomics protocols. In part, this is due 
to the hydrophobicity of membrane proteins as well as their general lower 
absolute abundance, which hinders detection. Here, we performed a combination of 
whole cell lysate proteomics and proteomics of membrane extracts solubilised 
with either SDS or FOS-choline-12 at various temperatures. The combined methods 
led to the detection of 158 membrane proteins containing at least a single 
transmembrane helix (TMH). Within this data set we revealed a full oxidative 
phosphorylation pathway as well as an alternative NADH dehydrogenase type II 
(Ndh-2) and a microaerophilic cytochrome oxidase ba3. We also observed C. 
thermarum TA2.A1 expressing transporters for ectoine and glycine betaine, 
compounds that are known osmolytes that may assist in maintaining a near neutral 
internal pH when the external pH is highly alkaline.

This study focused on the isolation and identification of a novel alkaline 
protease-producing strain from Lake Van, the largest soda lake on Earth. The 
objective was to purify, characterize, and investigate the potential application 
of protease in the detergent industry. Through a combination of classical and 
molecular methods, the most potent protease producer was identified as 
Exiguobacterium alkaliphilum VLP1. The purification process, involving ammonium 
sulfate precipitation, ultrafiltration, and anion exchange chromatography, 
resulted in a 45-fold purification with a yield of 6.4% and specific activity of 
1169 U mg-1 protein. The enzyme exhibited a molecular weight of 69 kDa, a Km 
value of 0.4 mm, and a maximal velocity (Vmax ) value of 2000 U mg-1 . The 
optimum activity was observed at 40°C and potential of hydrogen (pH) 9, while 
the enzyme also exhibited remarkable stability in the ranges of 30-60°C and pH 
9-12. Notably, this study represents the first report of an alkaline protease 
isolated and characterized from E. alkaliphilum. This study also highlighted the 
potential of the enzyme as a detergent additive, as it showed compatibility with 
commercial detergents and effectively removed blood and chocolate stains from 
fabrics.

Extremophiles have much to reveal about the biology of resilience, yet their 
study is limited by sampling and culturing difficulties [1-3]. The broad success 
and small size of nematodes make them advantageous for tackling these problems 
[4-6]. We investigated the arsenic-rich, alkaline, and hypersaline Mono Lake 
(CA, US) [7-9] for extremophile nematodes. Though Mono Lake has previously been 
described to contain only two animal species (brine shrimp and alkali flies) in 
its water and sediments [10], we report the discovery of eight nematode species 
from the lake, including microbe grazers, parasites, and predators. Thus, 
nematodes are the dominant animals of Mono Lake in species richness. 
Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the nematodes originated from multiple 
colonization events, which is striking, given the young history of extreme 
conditions at Mono Lake [7, 11]. One species, Auanema sp., is new, culturable, 
and survives 500 times the human lethal dose of arsenic. Comparisons to two 
non-extremophile sister species [12] reveal that arsenic resistance is a common 
feature of the genus and a preadaptive trait that likely allowed Auanema to 
inhabit Mono Lake. This preadaptation may be partly explained by a variant in 
the gene dbt-1 shared with some Caenorhabditis elegans natural populations and 
known to confer arsenic resistance [13]. Our findings expand Mono Lake's 
ecosystem from two known animal species to ten, and they provide a new system 
for studying arsenic resistance. The dominance of nematodes in Mono Lake and 
other extreme environments and our findings of preadaptation to arsenic raise 
the intriguing possibility that nematodes are widely pre-adapted to be 
extremophiles.

The ability of an ice-binding protein (IBP) from Marinomonas primoryensis 
(MpIBP) to influence ice crystal growth and structure in nonphysiological pH 
environments was investigated in this work. The ability for MpIBP to retain ice 
interactivity under stressed environmental conditions was determined via (1) a 
modified splat assay to determine ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) of 
polycrystalline ice and (2) nanoliter osmometry to evaluate the ability of MpIBP 
to dynamically shape the morphology of a single ice crystal. Circular dichroism 
(CD) was used to relate the IRI and DIS activity of MpIBP to secondary 
structure. The results illustrate that MpIBP secondary structure was stable 
between pH 6 and pH 10. It was found that MpIBP did not interact with ice at 
pH ≤ 4 or pH ≥ 13. At 6 ≤ pH ≥ 12 MpIBP exhibited a reduction in grain size of 
ice crystals as compared to control solutions and demonstrated dynamic ice 
shaping at 6 ≤ pH ≥ 10. The results substantiate that MpIBP retains some 
secondary structure and function in non-neutral pH environments; thereby, 
enabling its potential utility in nonphysiological materials science and 
engineering applications.

BACKGROUND: Canavalia rosea (Sw.) DC. (bay bean) is an extremophile halophyte 
that is widely distributed in coastal areas of the tropics and subtropics. 
Seawater and drought tolerance in this species may be facilitated by aquaporins 
(AQPs), channel proteins that transport water and small molecules across cell 
membranes and thereby maintain cellular water homeostasis in the face of abiotic 
stress. In C. rosea, AQP diversity, protein features, and their biological 
functions are still largely unknown.
RESULTS: We describe the action of AQPs in C. rosea using evolutionary analyses 
coupled with promoter and expression analyses. A total of 37 AQPs were 
identified in the C. rosea genome and classified into five subgroups: 11 plasma 
membrane intrinsic proteins, 10 tonoplast intrinsic proteins, 11 Nod26-like 
intrinsic proteins, 4 small and basic intrinsic proteins, and 1 X-intrinsic 
protein. Analysis of RNA-Seq data and targeted qPCR revealed organ-specific 
expression of aquaporin genes and the involvement of some AQP members in 
adaptation of C. rosea to extreme coral reef environments. We also analyzed C. 
rosea sequences for phylogeny reconstruction, protein modeling, cellular 
localizations, and promoter analysis. Furthermore, one of PIP1 gene, CrPIP1;5, 
was identified as functional using a yeast expression system and transgenic 
overexpression in Arabidopsis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that AQPs play an important role in C. rosea 
responses to saline-alkaline soils and drought stress. These findings not only 
increase our understanding of the role AQPs play in mediating C. rosea 
adaptation to extreme environments, but also improve our knowledge of plant 
aquaporin evolution more generally.

Bidirectional extracellular electron transfer (EET) is crucial to upholding 
microbial metabolism with insoluble electron acceptors or donors in anoxic 
environments. Investigating bidirectional EET-capable microorganisms is desired 
to understand the cell-cell and microbe-mineral interactions and their role in 
mineral cycling besides leveraging their energy generation and conversion, 
biosensing, and bio-battery applications. Here, we report on iron cycling by 
haloalkaliphilic Geoalkalibacter halelectricus via bidirectional EET under 
haloalkaline conditions. It efficiently reduces Fe3+ oxide (Fe2O3) to Fe0 at a 
0.75 ± 0.08 mM/mgprotein/d rate linked to acetate oxidation via outward EET and 
oxidizes Fe0 to Fe3+ at a 0.24 ± 0.03 mM/mgprotein/d rate via inward EET to 
reduce fumarate. Bioelectrochemical cultivation confirmed its outward and inward 
EET capabilities. It produced 895 ± 23 µA/cm2 current by linking acetate 
oxidation to anode reduction via outward EET and reduced fumarate by drawing 
electrons from the cathode (‒2.5 ± 0.3 µA/cm2) via inward EET. The cyclic 
voltammograms of G. halelectricus biofilms revealed redox moieties with 
different formal potentials, suggesting the involvement of different membrane 
components in bidirectional EET. The cyclic voltammetry and GC-MS analysis of 
the cell-free spent medium revealed the lack of soluble redox mediators, 
suggesting direct electron transfer by G. halelecctricus in achieving 
bidirectional EET. By reporting on the first haloalkaliphilic bacterium capable 
of oxidizing and reducing insoluble Fe0 and Fe3+ oxide, respectively, this study 
advances the limited understanding of the metabolic capabilities of 
extremophiles to respire on insoluble electron acceptors or donors via 
bidirectional EET and invokes the possible role of G. halelectricus in iron 
cycling in barely studied haloalkaline environments. IMPORTANCE Bidirectional 
extracellular electron transfer (EET) appears to be a key microbial metabolic 
process in anoxic environments that are depleted in soluble electron donor and 
acceptor molecules. Though it is an ecologically important and applied microbial 
phenomenon, it has been reported with a few microorganisms, mostly from 
nonextreme environments. Moreover, direct electron transfer-based bidirectional 
EET is studied for very few microorganisms with electrodes in engineered systems 
and barely with the natural insoluble electron acceptor and donor molecules in 
anoxic conditions. This study advances the understanding of extremophilic 
microbial taxa capable of bidirectional EET and its role in barely investigated 
Fe cycling in highly saline-alkaline environments. It also offers research 
opportunities for understanding the membrane components involved in the 
bidirectional EET of G. halelectricus. The high rate of Fe3+ oxide reduction 
activity by G. halelectricus suggests its possible use as a biocatalyst in the 
anaerobic iron bioleaching process under neutral-alkaline pH conditions.

Hydrostatic pressure is a distinctive feature of deep-sea environments, and this 
thermodynamic parameter has potentially inhibitory effects on organisms adapted 
to living at atmospheric pressure. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 
hydrostatic pressure causes a delay in or cessation of growth. The vacuole is a 
large acidic organelle involved in degradation of cellular proteins or storage 
of ions and various metabolites. Vacuolar pH, as determined using the 
pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 6-carboxyfluorescein, was analyzed in a hydrostatic 
chamber with transparent windows under elevated hydrostatic pressure conditions. 
A pressure of 40-60 MPa transiently reduced the vacuolar pH by approximately 
0.33. A vma3 mutant defective in vacuolar acidification showed no reduction of 
vacuolar pH after application of hydrostatic pressure, indicating that the 
transient acidification is mediated through the function of vacuolar 
H(+)-ATPase. The vacuolar acidification was observed only in the presence of 
fermentable sugars, and never observed in the presence of ethanol, glycerol, or 
3-o-methyl-glucose as the carbon source. Analysis of a glycolysis-defective 
mutant suggested that glycolysis or CO2 production is involved in the 
pressure-induced acidification. Hydration and ionization of CO2 is facilitated 
by elevated hydrostatic pressure because a negative volume change (delta V < 0) 
accompanies the chemical reaction. Moreover the glucose-induced cytoplasmic 
alkalization is inhibited by elevated hydrostatic pressure, probably because of 
inhibition of the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase. Therefore, the cytoplasm tends to 
become acidic under elevated hydrostatic pressure conditions, and this could be 
crucial for cell survival. To maintain a favorable cytoplasmic pH, the yeast 
vacuoles may serve as proton sequestrants under hydrostatic pressure. We are 
investigating the physiological effects of hydrostatic pressure in the course of 
research in a new experimental field, baro-(piezo-) physiology.

A gene construct encoding a xylanase, which is active in extreme conditions of 
temperature and alkaline pH (90 °C, pH 10.5), has been transitorily expressed 
with high efficiency in Nicotiana benthamiana using a viral vector. The enzyme, 
targeted to the apoplast, accumulates in large amounts in plant tissues in as 
little as 7 days after inoculation, without detrimental effects on plant growth. 
The properties of the protein produced by the plant, in terms of resistance to 
temperature, pH, and enzymatic activity, are equivalent to those observed when 
Escherichia coli is used as a host. Purification of the plant-produced 
recombinant xylanase is facilitated by exporting the protein to the apoplastic 
space. The production of this xylanase by N. benthamiana, which avoids the 
hindrances derived from the use of E. coli, namely, intracellular production 
requiring subsequent purification, represents an important step for potential 
applications in the food industry in which more sustainable and green products 
are continuously demanded. As an example, the use of the enzyme producing 
prebiotic xylooligosdaccharides from xylan is here reported.

Extremophilic actinomycetes strains can survive extreme saline and alkaline 
environments and produce antimicrobial agents. In this chapter, we discuss 
laboratory methods that can be used to isolate and characterize actinomycetes 
strains capable of potentially producing novel antimicrobial agent(s) when 
cultured in conditions that mimic the environments from which they were 
isolated. Methods used to screen for antibacterial and antiviral activities from 
these producer strains, and microbiological and molecular approaches used to 
identify these strains are described. Here we describe three methods. Method 1 
focuses on the strategy to select optimal conditions to synthesize and 
accumulate the antibiotics from the studied actinomycetes strains by preparing 
crude extracts. In Method 2, we describe the screening strategies used to test 
the actinomycetes strains against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, 
antifungal agents, multidrug-resistant pathogens (MDR), and viral pathogens. 
Thus, the specific techniques to test for MDR pathogens such as the disk 
diffusion assay and wells assay are outlined. We also describe the antiviral 
activity screening of the selected actinomycetes extracts in Method 2 of this 
chapter. Specifically, we concentrate on methods used to test for antiviral 
activities such as primary hemolytic, hemagglutination, neuraminidase, and 
specific virus-inhibitory activities. Finally, the Method 3 section reveals the 
microbiological techniques used to morphologically characterize the 
actinomycetes strains that depend on the culture medium utilized for growth. 
Additionally, the method used to perform a detailed characterization of the 
morphology that actinomycetes strains possess is specified by the protocol for 
sample preparation and visualization using the scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM). Finally, we summarize the molecular approaches used to characterize 
actinomycetes strains, focusing specifically on the PCR and sequencing 
techniques.

The central challenge for extremely alkaliphilic Bacillus species is the need to 
establish and sustain a cytoplasmic pH that is over two units lower than the 
highly alkaline medium. Its centrality is suggested by the strong correlation 
between the growth rate in the upper range of pH for growth, i.e., at values 
above pH 10.5, and the cytoplasmic pH. The diminishing growth rate at extremely 
high pH values correlates better with the rise in cytoplasmic pH than with other 
energetic parameters. There are also general adaptations of alkaliphiles that 
are crucial prerequisites for pH homeostasis as well as other cell functions, 
i.e., the reduced basic amino acid content of proteins or segments thereof that 
are exposed to the medium, and there are other challenges of alkaliphily that 
emerge from solution of the cytoplasmic pH problem, i.e., reduction of the 
chemiosmotic driving force. For cells growing on glucose, strong evidence exists 
for the importance of acidic cell wall components, teichuronic acid and 
teichuronopeptides, in alkaliphily. These wall macromolecules may provide a 
passive barrier to ion flux. For cells growing on fermentable carbon sources, 
this and other passive mechanisms may have a particularly substantial role, but 
for cells growing on both fermentable and nonfermentable substrates, an active 
Na+-dependent cycle is apparently required for alkaliphily and the alkaliphile's 
remarkable capacity for pH homeostasis. The active cycle involves primary 
establishment of an electrochemical gradient via proton extrusion, a secondary 
electrogenic Na+/H+ antiport to achieve net acidification of the cytoplasm 
relative to the outside pH, and mechanisms for Na+ re-entry. Recent work in 
several laboratories on the critical antiporters involved in this cycle has 
begun to clarify the number and characteristics of the porters that support 
active mechanisms of pH homeostasis.

Chromium is one of the most widely used metals in industry. Hexavalent form 
[Cr(VI)], which is found in industrial discharges, is very toxic and very 
soluble in water. From soil taken from an abandoned lead and iron mine, a 
bacterial strain capable of reducing Cr(VI) was isolated and identified as 
Brachybacterium paraconglomeratum ER41. Objective of this work was to evaluate 
the power of this bacterium to reduce Cr(VI). Results obtained showed that this 
bacterium is capable of eliminating 100 mg/L of Cr(VI) after 48 h (pH 8 and 
temperature 30 °C). For modeling biosorption kinetics, pseudo-first-order and 
intraparticle diffusion models gave a better fit. Furthermore, the adsorption 
mechanism conformed well to Langmuir's isothermal model indicating monolayer 
type sorption. Biomass analysis of this bacterium before and after contact with 
chromium by scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray and by Fourier 
transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the surface ligands of bacterial 
wall are probably responsible for biosorption and bioreduction process. These 
results suggest a potential application of B. paraconglomeratum ER41 in 
bioremediation of polluted discharges.

Cloning and expression of recombinant alkaline serine proteases from two salt 
tolerant alkaliphilic actinomycetes strains: OM-6 (EU710555.1) and OK-5 
(HM560975) were successfully obtained in mesophilic host, Escherichia coli. The 
positive clones harboring protease genes were selected on the basis of 
restriction analysis on agarose gel. The effect of temperature and IPTG 
concentrations on the expression of recombinant proteases and solubilization of 
the expressed enzymes was assessed. SDS-PAGE revealed protease bands 
corresponding to 25 kDa and 20 kDa molecular mass representing OM-6 and OK-5 
proteases, respectively. Cloning and expression of alkaline proteases from salt 
tolerant alkaliphilic actinomycetes would pave the way for further biochemical 
and molecular characterization to achieve unexplored features of the 
biocatalysts from extremophiles.

Primitive terrestrial life-defined as a chemical system able to transfer its 
molecular information via self-replication and to evolve-probably originated 
from the evolution of reduced organic molecules in liquid water. Several sources 
have been proposed for the prebiotic organic molecules: terrestrial primitive 
atmosphere (methane or carbon dioxide), deep-sea hydrothermal systems, and 
extraterrestrial meteoritic and cometary dust grains. The study of carbonaceous 
chondrites, which contain up to 5% by weight of organic matter, has allowed 
close examination of the delivery of extraterrestrial organic material. Eight 
proteinaceous amino acids have been identified in the Murchison meteorite among 
more than 70 amino acids. Engel reported that L-alanine was surprisingly more 
abundant than D-alanine in the Murchison meteorite. Cronin also found excesses 
of L-enantiomers for nonprotein amino acids. A large collection of 
micrometeorites has been recently extracted from Antarctic old blue ice. In the 
50- to 100-micron size range, carbonaceous micrometeorites represent 80% of the 
samples and contain 2% of carbon, on average. They might have brought more 
carbon than that involved in the present surficial biomass. The early histories 
of Mars and Earth clearly show similarities. Liquid water was once stable on the 
surface of Mars, attesting the presence of an atmosphere capable of 
deccelerating C-rich micrometeorites. Therefore, primitive life may have 
developed on Mars as well and fossilized microorganisms may still be present in 
the near subsurface. The Viking missions to Mars in 1976 did not find evidence 
of either contemporary or past life, but the mass spectrometer on the lander 
aeroshell determined the atmospheric composition, which has allowed a family of 
meteorites to be identified as Martian. Although these samples are essentially 
volcanic in origin, it has been recognized that some of them contain carbonate 
inclusions and even veins that have a carbon isotopic composition indicative of 
an origin from Martian atmospheric carbon dioxide. The oxygen isotopic 
composition of these carbonate deposits allows calculation of the temperature 
regime existing during formation from a fluid that dissolved the carbon dioxide. 
As the composition of the fluid is unknown, only a temperature range can be 
estimated, but this falls between 0 degree and 90 degrees C, which would seem 
entirely appropriate for life processes. It was such carbonate veins that were 
found to host putative microfossils. Irrespective of the existence of features 
that could be considered to be fossils, carbonate-rich portions of Martian 
meteorites tend to have material, at more than 1000 ppm, that combusts at a low 
temperature; i.e., it is an organic form of carbon. Unfortunately, this organic 
matter does not have a diagnostic isotopic signature so it cannot be 
unambiguously said to be indigenous to the samples. However, many circumstantial 
arguments can be made to the effect that it is cogenetic with the carbonate and 
hence Martian. If it could be proved that the organic matter was preterrestrial, 
then the isotopic fractionation between it and the carbon is in the right sense 
for a biological origin.

A gene (estA', 804 bp) from Streptomyces lividans TK24 was artificially 
synthesized and successfully overexpressed as a 6His-tagged fusion protein in 
Escherichia coli. It encoded a carboxylesterase (EstA) that composed of 267 
amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 28.56 kDa. Multiple sequence 
alignment indicated that EstA has typical characteristics of esterases, 
including a catalytic triad (Ser93-Asp194-His224) and a conserved pentapeptide 
motif (Gly91-Leu92-Ser93-Met94-Gly95). Simultaneously, phylogenetic analysis 
indicated that EstA belongs to family VI. Biochemical characterization displayed 
its optimum enzyme activity was at 55 ℃ and pH 8.5. Additionally, EstA exhibited 
higher activity towards short carbon substrates and showed the outstanding 
catalytic efficiency for pNPA2 with kcat/Km of 2296.14 ± 10.35 s-1 mM-1. 
Notably, EstA has hyper-thermostability and good alkali stability. The activity 
of EstA did not change obviously when incubated at 50 and 100 ℃ for 337 and 1 h, 
independently. Besides, by incubating at 100 ℃ for 6 h, EstA remained about half 
of its initial activity. Moreover, EstA showed stability at pH ranging from 8.0 
to 11.0, and about 90% residual enzyme activity was reserved by being treated at 
pH 8.0 or 9.0 for 80 h, especially. Such multiple features prepare EstA for a 
potential candidate in the field of biological catalysis of some industrial 
applications under harsh conditions.

Bacillus species and other microbes with pH optima for growth higher than pH 9 
are defined as alkaliphiles. A large number of alkaliphilic Bacillus strains 
producing useful enzymes, have been isolated from various environments. Some of 
these enzymes, such as proteases and cellulases from alkaliphilic Bacillus 
strains, have been commercialized and have brought great advantages to industry 
and domestic life. To support further development of the enzyme industry, we 
initiated analysis of the genome of Bacillus halodurans C-125, which is 4.25Mb 
in size, and constructed a physical and genetic map for comparison with the 
Bacillus subtilis chromosome. Systematic sequencing of the whole genome of 
Bacillus halodurans C-125 has been automated since the beginning of May 1998, 
and sequencing of 98% of the whole genome has been done so far. Through genome 
analysis, it became apparent that the genome organization of alkaliphilic 
Bacillus halodurans C-125 is totally different from that of B. subtilis 
orthologues.

Concrete is one of the most commonly used building materials ever used. Despite 
it is a very important and common construction material, concrete is very 
sensitive to crack formation and requires repair. A variety of chemical-based 
techniques and materials have been developed to repair concrete cracks. Although 
the use of these chemical-based repair systems are the best commercially 
available choices, there have also been concerns related to their use. These 
repair agents suffer from inefficiency and unsustainability. Most of the 
products are expensive and susceptible to degradation, exhibit poor bonding to 
the cracked concrete surfaces, and are characterized by different physical 
properties such as thermal expansion coefficients which are different to that of 
concrete. Moreover, many of these repair agents contain chemicals that pose 
environmental and health hazards. Thus, there has been interest in developing 
concrete crack repair agents that are efficient, long lasting, safe, and benign 
to the environment and exhibit physical properties which resemble that of the 
concrete. The search initiated by these desires brought the use of 
biomineralization processes as tools in mending concrete cracks. Among 
biomineralization processes, microbially initiated calcite precipitation has 
emerged as an interesting alternative to the existing chemical-based concrete 
crack repairing system. Indeed, results of several studies on the use of 
microbial-based concrete repair agents revealed the remarkable potential of this 
approach in the fight against concrete deterioration. In addition to repairing 
existing concrete cracks, microorganisms have also been considered to make 
protective surface coating (biodeposition) on concrete structures and in making 
self-healing concrete.Even though a wide variety of microorganisms can 
precipitate calcite, the nature of concrete determines their applicability. One 
of the important factors that determine the applicability of microbes in 
concrete is pH. Concrete is highly alkaline in nature, and hence the microbes 
envisioned for this application are alkaliphilic or alkali-tolerant. This work 
reviews the available information on applications of microbes in concrete: 
repairing existing cracks, biodeposition, and self-healing. Moreover, an effort 
is made to discuss biomineralization processes that are relevant to extend the 
durability of concrete structures. Graphical Abstract.

Halorhodospira (Hlr.) species are the most halophilic and alkaliphilic of all 
purple bacteria. Hlr. halochloris exhibits the lowest LH1 Qy transition energy 
among phototrophic organisms and is the only known triply extremophilic 
anoxygenic phototroph, displaying a thermophilic, halophilic, and alkaliphilic 
phenotype. Recently, we reported that electrostatic charges are responsible for 
the unusual spectroscopic properties of the Hlr. halochloris LH1 complex. In the 
present work, we examined the effects of salt and pH on the spectroscopic 
properties and thermal stability of LH1-RCs from Hlr. halochloris compared with 
its mesophilic counterpart, Hlr. abdelmalekii. Experiments in which the 
photocomplexes were subjected to different levels of salt or variable pH 
revealed that the thermal stability of LH1-RCs from both species was largely 
retained in the presence of high salt concentrations and/or at alkaline pH but 
was markedly reduced by lowering the salt concentration and/or pH. Based on the 
amino acid sequences of LH1 polypeptides and their composition of acidic/basic 
residues and the Hofmeister series for cation/anion species, we discuss the 
importance of electrostatic charge in stabilizing the Hlr. halochloris LH1-RC 
complex to allow it to perform photosynthesis in its warm, hypersaline, and 
alkaline habitat.

Most fish excrete their nitrogenous waste across the gills as ammonia through 
the activity of the Rhesus glycoprotein ammonium transporters. In contrast, fish 
of the subgenus Alcolapia (Oreochromis) are the only vertebrates that survive 
the extreme conditions of the soda lakes of Natron and Magadi in East Africa and 
have evolved adaptations to the highly alkaline waters including the ability to 
excrete their nitrogenous waste as urea. Nevertheless, Alcolapia retain the 
Rhesus glycoprotein genes in their genomes and using two heterologous expression 
systems, we demonstrate that Alcolapia Rhbg is capable of moving ammonia. 
Comparing ammonia and urea excretion from two closely related Alcolapia species 
from the same aquarium, we found that while Alcolapia grahami remains fully 
ureotelic after many generations in lab conditions, Alcolapia alcalica excretes 
some of its nitrogenous waste as ammonia. Using in situ hybridisation, we 
demonstrate robust, localised gene expression of Rhbg, rhcg1 and rhcg2 in the 
gill tissue in both A. alcalica embryos and adults, similar to that in other 
ammoniotelic fish. In contrast, the expression of these genes in A. grahami 
gills is much lower than in A. alcalica, suggesting the rapid evolution of a 
molecular mechanism underlying the complete ureotelism of A. grahami.

A high-alkaline, salt-activated alginate lyase is produced by Agarivorans sp. 
JAM-A1m from a deep-sea sediment off Cape Nomamisaki on Kyushu Island, Japan. 
Purified to homogeneity, as judged by SDS-PAGE, the enzyme (A1m) had a molecular 
mass of approximately 31 kDa. The optimal pH was around 10 in glycine-NaOH 
buffer, and the activity was increased to 1.8 times by adding 0.2 M NaCl. 
However, when the optimal pH in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl was shifted to pH 
9.0, the activity was more than 10 times compared with that at pH 9 in the 
absence of NaCl. A1m showed the optimal temperature at around 30 degrees C and 
was stable to incubation between pH 6 and 9. The enzyme degraded favorably 
mannuronate-guluronate and guluronate-rich fragments in alginate. Shotgun 
cloning and sequencing of the gene for A1m revealed a 930-bp open reading frame, 
which encoded a mature enzyme of 289 amino acids (32,295 Da) belonging to 
polysaccharide lyase family 7. The deduced amino acid sequence showed the 
highest similarity to that of a Klebsiella enzyme, with only 54% identity.

Tardigrades, also known as water bears, are small aquatic animals that inhabit 
marine, fresh water or limno-terrestrial environments. While all tardigrades 
require surrounding water to grow and reproduce, species living in 
limno-terrestrial environments (e.g. Ramazzottius varieornatus) are able to 
undergo almost complete dehydration by entering an arrested state known as 
anhydrobiosis, which allows them to tolerate ionic radiation, extreme 
temperatures and intense pressure. Previous studies based on comparison of the 
genomes of R. varieornatus and Hypsibius dujardini - a less tolerant tardigrade 
- have pointed to potential mechanisms that may partially contribute to their 
remarkable ability to resist extreme physical conditions. In this work, we have 
further annotated the genomes of both tardigrades using a guided approach in 
search for novel mechanisms underlying the extremotolerance of R. varieornatus. 
We have found specific amplifications of several genes, including MRE11 and XPC, 
and numerous missense variants exclusive of R. varieornatus in CHEK1, POLK, UNG 
and TERT, all of them involved in important pathways for DNA repair and telomere 
maintenance. Taken collectively, these results point to genomic features that 
may contribute to the enhanced ability to resist extreme environmental 
conditions shown by R. varieornatus.

Substantial advancements have been made in our comprehension of vegetative 
desiccation tolerance in resurrection plants, and further research is still 
warranted to elucidate the mechanisms governing distinct cellular adaptations. 
Resurrection plants are commonly referred to as a small group of extremophile 
vascular plants that exhibit vegetative desiccation tolerance (VDT), meaning 
that their vegetative tissues can survive extreme drought stress (> 90% water 
loss) and subsequently recover rapidly upon rehydration. In contrast to most 
vascular plants, which typically employ water-saving strategies to resist 
partial water loss and optimize water absorption and utilization to a limited 
extent under moderate drought stress, ultimately succumbing to cell death when 
confronted with severe and extreme drought conditions, resurrection plants have 
evolved unique mechanisms of VDT, enabling them to maintain viability even in 
the absence of water for extended periods, permitting them to rejuvenate without 
harm upon water contact. Understanding the mechanisms associated with VDT in 
resurrection plants holds the promise of expanding our understanding of how 
plants adapt to exceedingly arid environments, a phenomenon increasingly 
prevalent due to global warming. This review offers an updated and comprehensive 
overview of recent advances in VDT within resurrection plants, with particular 
emphasis on elucidating the metabolic and cellular adaptations during 
desiccation, including the intricate processes of cell wall folding and the 
prevention of cell death. Furthermore, this review highlights existing 
unanswered questions in the field, suggests potential avenues for further 
research to gain deeper insights into the remarkable VDT adaptations observed in 
resurrection plants, and highlights the potential application of VDT-derived 
techniques in crop breeding to enhance tolerance to extreme drought stress.

Antifreeze proteins are produced by extremophile species to control ice 
formation and growth, and they have potential applications in many fields. There 
are few examples of synthetic materials which can reproduce their potent ice 
recrystallization inhibition property. We report that self-assembled 
enantiomerically pure, amphipathic metallohelicies inhibited ice growth at just 
20 μM. Structure-property relationships and calculations support the hypothesis 
that amphipathicity is the key motif for activity. This opens up a new field of 
metallo-organic antifreeze protein mimetics and provides insight into the 
origins of ice-growth inhibition.

Ice Recrystallization Inhibiting Polymers Enable Glycerol-Free Cryopreservation 
of Microorganisms.

Hasan M, Fayter AER, Gibson MI.

All modern molecular biology and microbiology is underpinned by not only the 
tools to handle and manipulate microorganisms but also those to store, bank, and 
transport them. Glycerol is the current gold-standard cryoprotectant, but it is 
intrinsically toxic to most microorganisms: only a fraction of cells survive 
freezing and the presence of glycerol can impact downstream applications and 
assays. Extremophile organisms survive repeated freeze/thaw cycles by producing 
antifreeze proteins which are potent ice recrystallization inhibitors. Here we 
introduce a new concept for the storage/transport of microorganisms by using ice 
recrystallization inhibiting poly(vinyl alcohol) in tandem with poly(ethylene 
glycol). This cryopreserving formulation is shown to result in a 4-fold increase 
in E. coli yield post-thaw, compared to glycerol, utilizing lower 
concentrations, and successful cryopreservation shown as low as 1.1 wt % of 
additive. The mechanism of protection is demonstrated to be linked not only to 
inhibiting ice recrystallization (by comparison to a recombinant antifreeze 
protein) but also to the significantly lower toxicity of the polymers compared 
to glycerol. Optimized formulations are presented and shown to be broadly 
applicable to the cryopreservation of a panel of Gram-negative, Gram-positive, 
and mycobacteria strains. This represents a step-change in how microorganisms 
will be stored by the design of new macromolecular ice growth inhibitors; it 
should enable a transition from traditional solvent-based to macromolecular 
microbiology storage methods.

The search for life elsewhere in the Universe goes together with the search for 
liquid water. Life as we know it requires water; however, it is possible for 
microbial life to exist under hyperarid conditions with a minimal amount of 
water. We report on the ability of two typical terrestrial bacteria (Escherichia 
coli B and Eucapsis sp) and two extremophiles (Gloeocapsa-20201027-1 sp and 
Planococcus halocryophilus) to grow and survive in three martian soil (regolith) 
simulants (Mohave Mars Simulant-1 [MMS-1] F, Mars Global Simulant-1 [MGS-1], and 
JSC Mars-1A [JSC]). Survival and growth were assessed over a 21-day period under 
terrestrial conditions and with water:soil (vol:wt) ratios that varied from 
0.25:1 to 5:1. We found that Eucapsis and Gloeocapsa sp grew best in the 
simulants MMS and JSC, respectively, while P. halocryophilus growth rates were 
better in the JSC simulant. As expected, E. coli did not show significant 
growth. Our results indicate that these martian simulants and thus martian 
regolith, with minimal or no added nutrients or water, can support the growth of 
extremophiles such as P. halocryphilus and Gloeocapsa. Similar extremophiles on 
early Mars may have survived to the present in near-surface ecological niches 
analogous to those where these organisms exist on Earth.

The availability of microbiological and geochemical data from island-based and 
high-arsenic hydrothermal systems is limited. Here, the microbial diversity in 
island-based hot springs on Ambitle Island (Papua New Guinea) was investigated 
using culture-dependent and -independent methods. Waramung and Kapkai are 
alkaline springs high in sulfide and arsenic, related hydrologically to 
previously described hydrothermal vents in nearby Tutum Bay. Enrichments were 
carried out at 24 conditions with varying temperature (45, 80 °C), pH (6.5, 
8.5), terminal electron acceptors (O2, SO4 (2-), S(0), NO3 (-)), and electron 
donors (organic carbon, H2, As(III)). Growth was observed in 20 of 72 tubes, 
with media targeting heterotrophic metabolisms the most successful. 16S 
ribosomal RNA gene surveys of environmental samples revealed representatives in 
15 bacterial phyla and 8 archaeal orders. While the Kapkai 4 bacterial clone 
library is primarily made up of Thermodesulfobacteria (74%), no bacterial taxon 
represents a majority in the Kapkai 3 and Waramung samples (40% Proteobacteria 
and 39% Aquificae, respectively). Deinococcus/Thermus and Thermotogae are 
observed in all samples. The Thermococcales dominate the archaeal clone 
libraries (65-85%). Thermoproteales, Desulfurococcales, and uncultured Eury- and 
Crenarchaeota make up the remaining archaeal taxonomic diversity. The culturing 
and phylogenetic results are consistent with the geochemistry of the alkaline, 
saline, and sulfide-rich fluids. When compared to other alkaline, island-based, 
high-arsenic, or shallow-sea hydrothermal communities, the Ambitle Island 
archaeal communities are unique in geochemical conditions, and in taxonomic 
diversity, richness, and evenness.

Ice wedges differ from other types of surface and underground glacial bodies and 
are widely spread in perennially frozen sub-Arctic regions, but the bacterial 
and archaeal diversity in these permafrost features remains poorly studied. 
Here, we compared the prokaryotic community composition in the active layer and 
ancient, 13-19 kyr BP and ~ 40 kyr BP, ice wedge horizons from the same exposure 
profile of the Mammoth Mountain, using pyrosequencing 16S rRNA gene. The most 
abundant OTUs in the active layer were affiliated with Acidobacteria (31.81%) 
followed by Actinobacteria (18.29%), Proteobacteria (18.14%), Gemmatimonadetes 
(7.3%), Parcubacteria (7.13%) and Bacteroidetes (6.49%). The prokaryotic 
community in 13-19 kyr BP ice wedge differed at the phylum level by the 
predominance of Actinobacteria (29.15%) over Acidobacteria (19.52%), 
Proteobacteria (18.45%), Verrumicrobia (5.88%), Firmicutes (2.98%) and 
Gemmatimonadetes (2.87%). In contrast, the oldest (~ 40 kyr BP) ice wedge 
prokaryotic community was rather poor, and only three phyla Firmicutes (54.48%), 
Proteobacteria (31.42%) and Bacteroidetes (7.92%) constituted the major fraction 
of reads. Archaeal sequences contributed with no more than 0.6% to total reads 
in all studied samples. Apparently, the Mammoth Mountain exposure profile 
harbors insular microbial communities with specific structure that reflects the 
stratigraphy, properties and age.

To ascertain the saying ""Everything is everywhere, but the environment selects"", 
it was imperative to find out the main factor influencing bacterioplankton 
composition at genus level of Kongsfjorden where was influenced both by glacier 
melting water and Atlantic water. Thus, bacterioplankton diversity was 
investigated using pyrosequencing. In addition, nutrients, chlorophyll a, in 
situ temperature and salinity were measured. There were seventeen of 33 
identified genera with relative abundance > 0.1%. Redundancy analysis showed 
that 73.02% of bacterioplankton community variance could be explained by 
environmental parameters. Furthermore, most of the abundant genera demonstrated 
significant correlation with environment parameters revealed by correlation 
analysis. Moreover, phosphate, nitrate and Chl a concentration, and the 
abundance of top nine identified genera varied with water mass significantly as 
shown by analysis of variance. Our results supported the notion that 
environmental factors, especially water mass had significant effect on 
bacterioplankton distribution at genus level. Considering the high sensitivity 
to environmental change and low error rate in identification, bacterioplankton 
at genus level could be potential bio-markers for monitoring environmental 
changes.

Xylanases can boost pulp bleachability in Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) 
processes, but their industrial implementation for producing bleached kraft 
pulps is not straightforward. It requires enzymes to be active and stable at the 
extreme conditions of alkalinity and high temperature typical of this industrial 
process; most commercial enzymes are unable to withstand these conditions. In 
this work, a novel highly thermo and alkaline-tolerant xylanase from 
Pseudothermotoga thermarum was overproduced in E. coli and tested as a bleaching 
booster of hardwood kraft pulps to save chlorine dioxide (ClO2) during ECF 
bleaching. The extremozyme-stage (EXZ) was carried out at 90 °C and pH 10.5 and 
optimised at lab scale on an industrial oxygen-delignified eucalyptus pulp, 
enabling us to save 15% ClO2 to reach the mill brightness, and with no 
detrimental effect on paper properties. Then, the EXZ-assisted bleaching 
sequence was validated at pilot scale under industrial conditions, achieving 25% 
ClO2 savings and reducing the generation of organochlorinated compounds (AOX) by 
18%, while maintaining pulp quality and papermaking properties. Technology 
reproducibility was confirmed with another industrial kraft pulp from a mix of 
hardwoods. The new enzymatic technology constitutes a realistic step towards 
environmentally friendly production of kraft pulps through industrial 
integration of biotechnology.

Bauxite residue (red mud), generated during the extraction of alumina from 
bauxite ore is characterized by high pH, high concentrations of soluble ions 
with low or virtually no organic matter. These extreme conditions along with 
numerous nutrient deficiencies, limit the microbial growth and vegetation 
establishment. In the present study, diversity of both cultivable and 
non-cultivable bacteria present in the red mud was investigated by 16S rDNA 
sequence analyses. The cultivable bacteria were identified as Agromyces indicus, 
Bacillus litoralis, B. anthracis, Chungangia koreensis, Kokuria flava, K. 
polaris, Microbacterium hominis, Planococcus plakortidis, Pseudomonas 
alcaliphila and Salinococcus roseus based on their 16S rDNA sequence analysis. 
These isolates were alkali tolerant, positive for one or more of the enzyme 
activities tested, able to produce organic acids and oxidize wide range of 
carbon substrates. For non-cultivable diversity of bacteria, DNA was extracted 
from the bauxite residue samples and 16S rDNA clone library was constructed. The 
16S rDNA clones of this study showed affiliation to three major phyla 
predominant being betaproteobacteria (41.1%) followed by gammaproteobacteria 
(37.5%) and bacteroidetes (21.4%). We are reporting for the first time about the 
bacterial diversity of this unique and extreme environment.

""High-altitude Andean Lakes"" (HAAL) are pristine environments harboring 
poly-extremophilic microbes that show combined adaptations to physical and 
chemical stress such as large daily ambient thermal amplitude, extreme solar 
radiation levels, intense dryness, alkalinity, high concentrations of arsenic 
(up to 200 ppm) and dissolved salts. In this work, we compared the UV resistance 
profiles, pigment content and photoreactivation abilities of three UV-resistant 
bacteria isolated from distinct niches from HAALs, that is Acinetobacter sp. 
Ver3 (water, Lake Verde; 4400 m), Exiguobacterium sp. S17 (stromatolite, Lake 
Socompa, 3570 m) and Nesterenkonia sp. Act20 (soil, Lake Socompa, 3570 m). UV 
resistance ability of HAAL's strains indicate a clear adaptation to high 
radiation exposure encountered in their original habitat, which can be explained 
by genetic and physiological mechanisms named as the UV-resistome. Thus, the 
UV-resistome depends on the expression of a diverse set of genes devoted to 
evading or repairing the damage it provoked direct or indirectly. As pigment 
extraction and photoreactive assays indicate the presence of photoactive 
molecules, we characterized more in detail proteins with homology to 
photolyases/cryptochromes members (CPF). Phylogenetic analyses, sequence 
comparison and 3D modeling with bona fide CPF members were used to prove the 
presence of functional domains and key residues in the novel proteins.

In this study we explored the cultivable fungal diversity in Lake Magadi and 
their secondary metabolite production. Isolation was done on alkaline media 
(Potato dextrose agar, Malt extract agar, Oatmeal agar and Sabouraud dextrose 
agar). A total of 52 unique isolates were recovered from the lake and were 
characterized using different techniques. Growth was observed at pH, temperature 
and salinity ranges of between 6 - 10, 25 °C - 40 °C and 0%-20% respectively. 
Phylogenetically, the isolates were affiliated to 18 different genera with 
Aspergillus, Penicillium, Cladosporium, Phoma and Acremonium being dominant. A 
screen for the ability to produce extracellular enzymes showed that different 
isolates could produce proteases, chitinases, cellulases, amylases, pectinases 
and lipases. Production of antimicrobial metabolites was noted for isolate 11M 
affiliated to Penicillium chrysogenum (99%). Cell free extracts and crude 
extracts from this isolate had inhibitory effects on Bacillus subtilis, 
Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., 
Candida albicans and fungal plant pathogens Schizophyllum commune, Epicoccum 
sorghinum strain JME-11, Aspergillus fumigatus strain EG11-4, Cladosporium 
halotolerans CBS 119416, Phoma destructive and Didymella glomerata). In this 
study we showed that different cultivation strategies can lead to recovery of 
more phylotypes from the extreme environments. Growth under different 
physiological characteristics typical of the soda lake environment (elevated 
temperature, pH and salts) confirmed the haloalkaliphilic nature of the fungal 
isolates. The use of suitable antimicrobial production media can also lead to 
discovery of more phylotypes producing diverse biocatalysts and bioactive 
metabolites.

Thermostable alkaline cellulase (endo-1,4-beta-glucanase, EC 3.2.1.4) activity 
was detected in the culture medium of a strictly alkaliphilic strain of 
Bacillus, designated KSM-S237. This novel enzyme was purified to homogeneity by 
a two-step column-chromatographic procedure with high yield. The N-terminal 
amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme was 
Glu-Gly-Asn-Thr-Arg-Glu-Asp-Asn-Phe-Lys-His-Leu-Leu-Gly-Asn-Asp-Asn-Val- 
Lys-Arg. The enzyme had a molecular mass of approximately 86 kDa and an 
isoelectric point of pH 3.8. The enzyme had a pH optimum of 8.6-9.0 and 
displayed maximum activity at 45 degrees C. The alkaline enzyme was stable up to 
50 degrees C and more than 30% of the original activity was detectable after 
heating at 100 degrees C and at pH 9.0 for 10 min. The enzyme hydrolyzed 
carboxymethylcellulose, lichenan (beta-1,3;1,4-linkage), and p-nitrophenyl 
derivatives of cellotriose and cellotetraose. Crystalline forms of cellulose 
(Avicel and filter paper), H3PO4-swollen cellulose, NaOH-swollen cellulose, 
curdlan (beta-1,3-linkage), laminarin (beta-1,3;1,6-linkage), and xylan were 
barely hydrolyzed at all.

Bacterial diversity in alkaline (pH 10.4) and permanently cold (4 degrees C) 
ikaite tufa columns from the Ikka Fjord, SW Greenland, was investigated using 
growth characterization of cultured bacterial isolates with Terminal-restriction 
fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and sequence analysis of bacterial 16S 
rRNA gene fragments. More than 200 bacterial isolates were characterized with 
respect to pH and temperature tolerance, and it was shown that the majority were 
cold-active alkaliphiles. T-RFLP analysis revealed distinct bacterial 
communities in different fractions of three ikaite columns, and, along with 
sequence analysis, it showed the presence of rich and diverse bacterial 
communities. Rarefaction analysis showed that the 109 sequenced clones in the 
16S rRNA gene library represented between 25 and 65% of the predicted species 
richness in the three ikaite columns investigated. Phylogenetic analysis of the 
16S rRNA gene sequences revealed many sequences with similarity to alkaliphilic 
or psychrophilic bacteria, and showed that 33% of the cloned sequences and 33% 
of the cultured bacteria showed less than 97% sequence identity to known 
sequences in databases, and may therefore represent yet unknown species.

Hypersaline ecosystems host a particular microbiota, which can be specifically 
recruited by halophytes. In order to broaden our knowledge of hypersaline 
ecosystems, an in natura study was conducted on the microbiota associated with 
the halophyte Halocnemum strobilaceum from alkaline-saline arid soil in Algeria. 
We collected and identified a total of 414 strains isolated from root tissues 
(RT), root-adhering soil (RAS), non-adhering rhizospheric soil (NARS) and bulk 
soil (BS) using different NaCl concentrations. Our data showed that halophilic 
and halotolerant bacterial isolates in BS and the rhizosphere belonged to 32 
genera distributed in Proteobacteria (49%), Firmicutes (36%), Actinobacteria 
(14%) and Bacteroidetes (1%). Bacterial population size and species diversity 
were greatly increased in the rhizosphere (factor 100). The reservoir of 
diversity in BS was dominated by the genera Bacillus and Halomonas. 
Bacillus/Halomonas ratio decreased with the proximity to the roots from 2.2 in 
BS to 0.3 at the root surface. Salt screening of the strains showed that species 
belonging to nine genera were able to grow up to 5.1 M NaCl. Thus, we found that 
H. strobilaceum exerted a strong effect on the diversity of the recruited 
microbiota with an affinity strongly attributed to the genus Halomonas.

The search for extrasolar planets has already detected rocky planets and several 
planetary candidates with minimum masses that are consistent with rocky planets 
in the habitable zone of their host stars. A low-resolution spectrum in the form 
of a color-color diagram of an exoplanet is likely to be one of the first 
post-detection quantities to be measured for the case of direct detection. In 
this paper, we explore potentially detectable surface features on rocky 
exoplanets and their connection to, and importance as, a habitat for 
extremophiles, as known on Earth. Extremophiles provide us with the minimum 
known envelope of environmental limits for life on our planet. The color of a 
planet reveals information on its properties, especially for surface features of 
rocky planets with clear atmospheres. We use filter photometry in the visible as 
a first step in the characterization of rocky exoplanets to prioritize targets 
for follow-up spectroscopy. Many surface environments on Earth have 
characteristic albedos and occupy a different color space in the visible 
waveband (0.4-0.9 μm) that can be distinguished remotely. These detectable 
surface features can be linked to the extreme niches that support extremophiles 
on Earth and provide a link between geomicrobiology and observational astronomy. 
This paper explores how filter photometry can serve as a first step in 
characterizing Earth-like exoplanets for an aerobic as well as an anaerobic 
atmosphere, thereby prioritizing targets to search for atmospheric 
biosignatures.

Lignin degradation represents a significant challenge in biological 
valorization, but it is suffering from insufficiency, putting barriers to 
efficient lignin conversion. Herein, the study first develops a highly efficient 
laccase secretion apparatus, enabling high enzyme activity of 184 U/mL, 
complementing the biochemical limits on lignin depolymerization well in 
Halomonas sp. Y3. Further engineering of PHA biosynthesis produces a 
significantly high PHA titer of 286, 742, and 868 mg/L from alkaline lignin, 
catechol, and protocatechuate, respectively. The integration of 
laccase-secretion and PHA production modules enables a record titer of 693 and 
1209 mg/L in converting lignin and lignin-containing stream to PHA, 
respectively. The titer is improved furtherly to 740 and 1314 mg/L by developing 
a non-sterilized fermentation. This study advances a cheaper and greener 
production of valuable chemicals from lignin by constructing a biosynthetic 
platform for PHA production and provides novel insight into the lignin 
conversion by extremophilic microbes.

The hyper-alkaline, high-Ca(2+) springs of Maqarin, Jordan, were investigated as 
an analogue for various microbial processes at the extremely high pH generated 
by cement and concrete in some underground radioactive waste repositories. 
Leaching of metamorphic, cementitious phases in Maqarin has produced current, 
hyper-alkaline groundwater with a maximum pH of 12.9. Six consecutive 
expeditions were undertaken to the area during 1994-2000. The total number of 
microorganisms in the alkaline waters was 10(3)-10(5) cells/ml. Analysis of the 
16S-ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) diversity revealed microorganisms mainly 
belonging to the Proteobacteria. Obvious similarities between the obtained 
sequences and sequences from other alkaline sites could not be found. Numerous 
combinations of culture media compositions were inoculated with spring, seepage 
and groundwaters and incubated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions with 
various carbon sources. Assimilation studies were performed using identical 
radio-labeled carbon sources. Glucose seemed to be the preferred carbon source 
for assimilation, followed by acetate, lactate, and leucine. The results 
demonstrate that microorganisms from the hyper-alkaline springs of Maqarin could 
grow and be metabolically active under aerobic and anaerobic hyper-alkaline 
conditions. However, the growth and activity found were not vigorous; instead, 
slow growth, low numbers, and a generally low metabolic activity were found. 
This suggests that microbial activity will be low during the hyper-alkaline 
phase of cementitious repositories.

Bauxite residue (red mud) is considered an extremely alkaline and salty 
environment for the biota. We present the first attempt to isolate, identify and 
characterise microbes from Hungarian bauxite residues. Four identified bacterial 
strains belonged to the Bacilli class, one each to the Actinomycetia, 
Gammaproteobacteria, and Betaproteobacteria classes, and two to the 
Alphaproteobacteria class. All three identified fungi strains belonged to the 
Ascomycota division. Most strains tolerated pH 8-10 and salt content at 5-7% 
NaCl concentration. Alkalihalobacillus pseudofirmus BRHUB7 and Robertmurraya 
beringensis BRHUB9 can be considered halophilic and alkalitolerant. Priestia 
aryabhattai BRHUB2, Penicillium chrysogenum BRHUF1 and Aspergillus sp. BRHUF2 
are halo- and alkalitolerant strains. Most strains produced siderophores and 
extracellular polymeric substances, could mobilise phosphorous, and were 
cellulose degraders. These strains and their enzymes are possible candidates for 
biotechnological applications in processes requiring extreme conditions, e.g. 
bioleaching of critical raw materials and rehabilitation of alkaline waste 
deposits.

Cyanobacteria are a group of oxygenic phototrophs existing for at least 3.5 Ga. 
Photosynthetic CO2 assimilation by cyanobacteria occurs via the Calvin cycle, 
with RuBisCO, its key enzyme, having very low affinity to CO2. This is due to 
the fact that atmospheric CO2 concentration in Archaean, when the photosynthetic 
apparatus evolved, was several orders higher than now. Later, in the epoch of 
Precambrian microbial communities, CO2 content in the atmosphere decreased 
drastically. Thus, present-day phototrophs, including cyanobacteria, require 
adaptive mechanisms for efficient photosynthesis. In cyanobacterial cells, this 
function is performed by the CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM), which creates 
elevated CO2 concentrations in the vicinity of RuBisCO active centers, thus 
significantly increasing the rate of CO2 fixation in the Calvin cycle. CCM has 
been previously studied only for freshwater and marine cyanobacteria. We were 
the first to investigate CCM in haloalkaliphilic cyanobacteria from soda lakes. 
Extremophilic haloalkaliphilic cyanobacteria were shown to possess a 
well-developed CCM with the structure and functional principles similar to those 
of freshwater and marine strains. Analysis of available data suggests that 
regulation of the amount of inorganic carbon transported into the cell is 
probably the general CCM function under these conditions.

The accumulation of petroleum-based plastic waste has become a major issue for 
the environment. A sustainable and biodegradable solution can be found in 
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), a microbially produced biopolymer. An analysis of 
the global phylogenetic and ecological distribution of potential PHA producing 
bacteria and archaea was carried out by mining a global genome repository for 
PHA synthase (PhaC), a key enzyme involved in PHA biosynthesis. Bacteria from 
the phylum Actinobacteria were found to contain the PhaC Class II genotype which 
produces medium-chain length PHAs, a physiology until now only found within a 
few Pseudomonas species. Further, several PhaC genotypes were discovered within 
Thaumarchaeota, an archaeal phylum with poly-extremophiles and the ability to 
efficiently use CO2 as a carbon source, a significant ecological group which 
have thus far been little studied for PHA production. Bacterial and archaeal 
PhaC genotypes were also observed in high salinity and alkalinity conditions, as 
well as high-temperature geothermal ecosystems. These genome mining efforts 
uncovered previously unknown candidate taxa for biopolymer production, as well 
as microbes from environmental niches with properties that could potentially 
improve PHA production. This in silico study provides valuable insights into 
unique PHA producing candidates, supporting future bioprospecting efforts toward 
better targeted and relevant taxa to further enhance the diversity of 
exploitable PHA production systems.

Effluents from textile industries are highly colored due to vast use of various 
azo dyes and color is the first visual indicator of pollution. Biological 
treatment of textile effluent is often hampered due to the alkaline pH and high 
salinity; a common characteristic of many textile industrial wastewaters. 
Considering this, the present study explores the potential of a newly isolated 
halotolerant and alkaliphilic bacterium Nesterenkonia lacusekhoensis EMLA3 for 
degradation of methyl red (MR) dye under alkaline condition. Strain EMLA3 showed 
97% degradation of 50 mg L-1 MR after 16 h at initial pH of 11.5 in nutrient 
medium. Dye degradation by the isolate is supported by the formation of 
low-molecular weight metabolites as divulge through GC-MS & FTIR studies Optimum 
dye degradation was observed in the pH range of 8.0-11.5 and temperature range 
of 30-35 °C. Significant MR degrading activity of the strain could be achieved 
in the presence of very high salt level (100-120 g L-1 NaCl) and in co-presence 
of different heavy metals. Application of strain to alkaline pH, salt, and heavy 
metals laden-textile effluent resulted in overall 83% dye removal from the 
effluent after 120 h of treatment under static condition. Furthermore, the 
property of microbe to drop-down the pH of wastewater from 11.5 to 8.60 after 
treatment also lowers the need of additional neutralization treatment. The 
entire study thus comes out with novel application of N. lacusekhoensis-a less 
explored extremophilic bacterium-for treatment of alkaline and salt-rich azo 
dye-containing wastewaters.

Indigo is an insoluble blue dye historically used for dyeing textiles. A 
traditional approach for indigo dyeing involves microbial reduction of polygonum 
indigo to solubilize it under alkaline conditions; however, the mechanism by 
which microorganisms reduce indigo remains poorly understood. Here, we aimed to 
identify an enzyme that catalyzes indigo reduction; for this purpose, from 
alkaline liquor that performed microbial reduction of polygonum indigo, we 
isolated indigo carmine-reducing microorganisms. All isolates were facultative 
anaerobic and alkali-tolerant Bacillus spp. An isolate termed AO1 was found to 
be an alkaliphile that preferentially grows at pH 9.0-11.0 and at 30-35 °C. We 
focused on flavin-dependent azoreductase as a possible enzyme for indigo carmine 
reduction and identified its gene (azoA) in Bacillus sp. AO1 using 
homology-based strategies. azoA was monocistronic but clustered with ABC 
transporter genes. Primary sequence identities were < 50% between the azoA 
product (AzoA) and previously characterized flavin-dependent azoreductases. AzoA 
was heterologously produced as a flavoprotein tolerant to alkaline and organic 
solvents. The enzyme efficiently reduced indigo carmine in an NADH-dependent 
manner and showed strict specificity for electron acceptors. Notably, AzoA 
oxidized NADH in the presence, but not the absence, of indigo. The reaction rate 
was enhanced by adding organic solvents to solubilize indigo. Absorption 
spectrum analysis showed that indigo absorption decreased during the reaction. 
These observations suggest that AzoA can reduce indigo in vitro and potentially 
in Bacillus sp. AO1. This is the first study that identified an indigo 
reductase, providing a new insight into a traditional approach for indigo 
dyeing.

The first proctodeal (P1) segment in the hindgut of certain higher termites 
shows high alkalinity. We examined the bacterial diversity of the alkaline P1 
gut segments of four species of higher termites by T-RFLP and phylogenetic 
analyses based on PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes. The bacterial community of the 
P1 segment was apparently different from that of the whole gut in each termite. 
Sequence analysis revealed that Firmicutes (Clostridia and Bacilli) were 
dominant in the P1 segments of all four termites; however, the phylogenetic 
compositions varied among the termites. Although some of the P1 segment-derived 
sequences were related to the sequences previously reported from the alkaline 
digestive tracts of other insects, most of them formed phylogenetic clusters 
unique to termites. Such ""termite P1 clusters"" were distantly related to known 
bacterial species as well as to sequences reported from alkaline environments in 
nature. We successfully obtained enrichment cultures of Clostridia- and 
Bacilli-related bacteria, including putative novel species under anaerobic 
alkaline conditions from the termite guts. Our results suggest that the alkaline 
gut region of termites harbors unique bacterial lineages and are expected to be 
a rich reservoir of novel alkaliphiles yet to be cultivated.

Archaea, the most extremophilic domain of life, contain ether and branched 
lipids which provide extraordinary bilayer properties. We determined the 
structural characteristics of diether archaeal-like phospholipids as functions 
of hydration and temperature by neutron diffraction. Hydration and temperature 
are both crucial parameters for the self-assembly and physicochemical properties 
of lipid bilayers. In this study, we detected non-lamellar phases of 
archaeal-like lipids at low hydration levels, and lamellar phases at levels of 
90% relative humidity or more exclusively. Moreover, at 90% relative humidity, a 
phase transition between two lamellar phases was discernible. At full hydration, 
lamellar phases were present up to 70ᵒC and no phase transition was observed 
within the temperature range studied (from 25 °C to 70 °C). In addition, we 
determined the neutron scattering length density and the bilayer's structural 
parameters from different hydration and temperature conditions. At the highest 
levels of hydration, the system exhibited rearrangements on its corresponding 
hydrophobic region. Furthermore, the water uptake of the lipids examined was 
remarkably high. We discuss the effect of ether linkages and branched lipids on 
the exceptional characteristics of archaeal phospholipids.

Understanding the past habitable environments of Mars increases the requirement 
to recognize and examine modern analogs and to evaluate the mechanisms that may 
preserve biosignatures in them. The phenomenon that originates and preserves 
possible microbial biosignatures in mineral phases is of particular interest in 
astrobiology. On Earth, the precipitation of carbonate matrices can be mediated 
by bacteria. Besides microbialites and other sedimentary structures, carbonate 
formations can be observed in certain karstic caves. The present work is focused 
on the remote laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) characterization of 
cyanobacteria, exploring the possibilities for identification and discrimination 
on carbonate substrates. For this purpose, the extremophile cyanobacterium 
Chroococcidiopsis sp. (collected from the Nerja Cave, Malaga, Spain) was 
analyzed under laboratory-simulated martian conditions in terms of chemical 
composition and gas pressure. LIBS results related to acquired molecular 
emission features allowed bacterial differentiation from the colonized mineral 
substrate. In addition, the limits of detection were estimated with a 
laboratory-grown culture of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aureginosa. Our 
results reveal LIBS's capability to detect biological traces under simulated 
martian conditions. Additionally, the time-resolved analysis of the biological 
samples demonstrates the selection of optimal temporal conditions as a critical 
parameter for the preferential acquisition of molecular species in organic 
material.

Oxic methane production (OMP) has been reported to significantly contribute to 
methane emissions from oxic surface waters. Demethylation of organic compounds, 
photosynthesis-associated methane production, and (bacterio)chlorophyll 
reduction activity are some of the investigated mechanisms as potential OMP 
sources related to photosynthetic organisms. Recently, cyanobacteria have often 
been correlated with methane accumulation and emission in freshwater, marine, 
and saline systems. The Brazilian Pantanal is the world's largest wetland 
system, with approximately 10,000 shallow lakes, most of which are highly 
alkaline and saline extreme environments. We initiated this study with an 
overall investigation using genetic markers, from which we explored metagenomic 
and limnological data from the Pantanal soda for five potential OMP pathways. 
Our results showed a strong positive correlation between dissolved methane 
concentrations and bloom events. Metagenomic data and nutrients, mainly 
orthophosphate, nitrogen, iron, and methane concentrations, suggest that the 
organic phosphorous demethylation pathway has the most potential to drive OMP in 
lakes with blooms. A specialized bacterial community was identified, including 
the Cyanobacteria Raphidiopsis, although the bloom does not contain the genes to 
carry out this process. These data showed enough evidence to infer the 
occurrence of an OMP pathway at Pantanal soda lakes, including the microbial 
sources and their relation to the cyanobacterial blooms.

A great challenge in wastewater bioremediation is the sustained activity of 
viable microorganisms, which can contribute to the breakdown of waste 
contaminants, especially in alkaline pH conditions. Identification of 
extremophiles with bioremediation capability can improve the efficiency of 
wastewater treatment. Here, we report the discovery of an electrochemically 
active alkaliphilic halotolerant bacterium, Anditalea andensis ANESC-ST 
(=CICC10485T=NCCB 100412T), which is capable of generating bioelectricity in 
alkaline-saline conditions. A. andensis ANESC-ST was shown to grow in alkaline 
conditions between pH 7.0-11.0 and also under high salt condition (up to 4 wt% 
NaCl). Electrical output was further demonstrated in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) 
with an average current density of ~0.5 µA/cm2, even under the harsh condition 
of 4 wt% NaCl and pH 9.0. Subsequent introduction of secreted extracellular 
metabolites into MFCs inoculated with Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
yielded enhanced electrical output. The ability of A. andensis ANESC-ST to 
generate energy under alkaline-saline conditions points towards a solution for 
bioelectricity recovery from alkaline-saline wastewater. This is the first 
report of A.andensis ANESC-ST producing bioelectricity at high salt 
concentration and pH.

This study investigated the impact of seasonal variation and operating 
conditions on recovery of potable quality water from municipal wastewater 
effluent using an integrated algal treatment process with a dual forward osmosis 
(FO)-reverse osmosis (RO) membrane system. Pilot study of the algal process 
treating primary effluent validated the technical viability and seasonal 
performance during warm weather (May to October, 25-55 °C) using an 
extremophilic algal strain Galdieria sulphuraria, and during cold weather 
(November to April, 4-17 °C) using polyculture strains of algae and bacteria. 
Algal effluents from both seasons were used as the feed solution for the 
laboratory FO-RO study. In addition, pilot-scale FO-RO experiments were 
conducted to compare the system performance during treatment of algal effluent 
and secondary effluent from the conventional treatment facility. At 90% water 
recovery, the FO-RO achieved over 90% overall rejection of major ions and 
organic matter using the bench-scale system and over 99% rejection of all 
contaminants in pilot-scale studies. Detailed water quality analysis indicated 
that the product water from the integrated system met both the primary and 
secondary drinking water standards. This study demonstrated that the FO-RO 
system can be engineered as a viable alternative to treat algal effluent and 
secondary effluent for potable water reuse independent of seasonal variations 
and operating conditions.

The hypersaline Dead Sea and its sediments are natural laboratories for studying 
extremophile microorganism habitat response to environmental change. In modern 
times, increased freshwater runoff to the lake surface waters resulted in 
stratification and dilution of the upper water column followed by microbial 
blooms. However, whether these events facilitated a microbial response in the 
deep lake and sediments is obscure. Here we investigate archived evidence of 
microbial processes and changing regional hydroclimate conditions by 
reconstructing deep Dead Sea chemical compositions from pore fluid major ion 
concentration and stable S, O, and C isotopes, together with lipid biomarkers 
preserved in the hypersaline deep Dead Sea ICDP-drilled core sediments dating to 
the early Holocene (ca. 10,000 years BP). Following a significant negative lake 
water balance resulting in salt layer deposits at the start of the Holocene, 
there was a general period of positive net water balance at 9500-8300 years BP. 
The pore fluid isotopic composition of sulfate exhibit evidence of intensified 
microbial sulfate reduction, where both δ34S and δ18O of sulfate show a sharp 
increase from estimated base values of 15.0‰ and 13.9‰ to 40.2‰ and 20.4‰, 
respectively, and a δ34S vs. δ18O slope of 0.26. The presence of the n-C17 
alkane biomarker in the sediments suggests an increase of cyanobacteria or 
phytoplankton contribution to the bulk organic matter that reached the deepest 
parts of the Dead Sea. Although hydrologically disconnected, both the 
Mediterranean Sea and the Dead Sea microbial ecosystems responded to increased 
freshwater runoff during the early Holocene, with the former depositing the 
organic-rich sapropel 1 layer due to anoxic water column conditions. In the Dead 
Sea prolonged positive net water balance facilitated primary production and 
algal blooms in the upper waters and intensified microbial sulfate reduction in 
the hypolimnion and/or at the sediment-brine interface.

Microbial selenite reduction has increasingly attracted attention from the 
scientific community because it allows the separation of toxic Se from waste 
sources with the concurrent recovery of Se nanoparticles, a multifunctional 
material in nanotechnology industries. In this study, four selenite-reducing 
bacteria, isolated from a river water sample, were found to reduce selenite by > 
85% within 3 d of incubation, at ambient temperature. Among them, strain NDSe-7, 
belonging to genus Lysinibacillus, can reduce selenite and produce Se 
nanospheres in alkaline conditions, up to pH 10.0, and in salinity of up to 
7.0%. This strain can reduce 80 mg/L of selenite to elemental Se within 24 h at 
pH 6.0-8.0, at a temperature of 30-40 °C, and salinity of 0.1-3.5%. Strain 
NDSe-7 exhibited potential for use in Se removal and recovery from industrial 
saline wastewater with high alkalinity. This study indicates that extremophilic 
microorganisms for environmental remediation can be found in a conventional 
environment.

Solidified media that employ a porous matrix of nanofibrous cellulose are 
described. The physicochemical stability of the porous structure allows the 
development of solidified media that can support the growth of extremophiles, 
such as acidophilic Acidiphilium, alkaliphilic Bacillus, thermophilic 
Geobacillus and Thermus, alkalithermophilic Bacillus, and acidothermophilic 
Sulfolobus microbes. The cellulose-supported media have several advantages over 
agar- and gellan gum-derived media, including versatility and stability.

We assessed fungal diversity present in glacial from the Antarctic Peninsula 
using DNA metabarcoding through high-throughput sequencing (HTS). We detected a 
total of 353,879 fungal DNA reads, representing 94 genera and 184 taxa, in 
glacial ice fragments obtained from seven sites in the north-west Antarctic 
Peninsula and South Shetland Islands. The phylum Ascomycota dominated the 
sequence diversity, followed by Basidiomycota and Mortierellomycota. Penicillium 
sp., Cladosporium sp., Penicillium atrovenetum, Epicoccum nigrum, 
Pseudogymnoascus sp. 1, Pseudogymnoascus sp. 2, Phaeosphaeriaceae sp. and 
Xylaria grammica were the most dominant taxa, respectively. However, the 
majority of the fungal diversity comprised taxa of rare and intermediate 
relative abundance, predominately known mesophilic fungi. High indices of 
diversity and richness were calculated, along with moderate index of dominance, 
which varied among the different sampling sites. Only 26 (14%) of the total 
fungal taxa detected were present at all sampling sites. The identified 
diversity was dominated by saprophytic taxa, followed by known plant and animal 
pathogens and a low number of symbiotic fungi. Our data suggest that Antarctic 
glacial ice may represent a hotspot of previously unreported fungal diversity; 
however, further studies are required to integrate HTS and culture approaches to 
confirm viability of the taxa detected.

The high-altitude atmosphere is a harsh environment with extremely low 
temperatures, low pressure, and high UV irradiation. For this reason, it has 
been proposed as an analogue for Mars, presenting deleterious factors similar to 
those on the surface of that planet. We evaluated the survival of extremophilic 
UV-resistant yeasts isolated from a high-elevation area in the Atacama Desert 
under stratospheric conditions. As biological controls, intrinsically resistant 
Bacillus subtilis spores were used. Experiments were performed in two 
independent stratospheric balloon flights and with an environmental simulation 
chamber. The three following different conditions were evaluated: (i) 
desiccation, (ii) desiccation plus exposure to stratospheric low pressure and 
temperature, and (3) desiccation plus exposure to the full stratospheric 
environment (UV, low pressure, and temperature). Two strains, Naganishia 
(Cryptococcus) friedmannii 16LV2 and Exophiala sp. strain 15LV1, survived full 
exposures to the stratosphere in larger numbers than did B. subtilis spores. 
Holtermanniella watticus (also known as Holtermanniella wattica) 16LV1, however, 
suffered a substantial loss in viability upon desiccation and did not survive 
the stratospheric UV exposure. The remarkable resilience of N. friedmannii and 
Exophiala sp. 15LV1 under the extreme Mars-like conditions of the stratosphere 
confirms its potential as a eukaryotic model for astrobiology. Additionally, our 
results with N. friedmannii strengthen the recent hypothesis that yeasts 
belonging to the Naganishia genus are fit for aerial dispersion, which might 
account for the observed abundance of this species in high-elevation 
soils.IMPORTANCE Studies of eukaryotic microorganisms under conditions of 
astrobiological relevance, as well as the aerial dispersion potential of 
extremophilic yeasts, are still lacking in the literature compared to works with 
bacteria. Using stratospheric balloon flights and a simulation chamber, we 
demonstrate that yeasts isolated from an extreme environment are capable of 
surviving all stressors found in the stratosphere, including intense UV 
irradiation, scoring an even higher survival than B. subtilis spores. Notably, 
the yeast N. friedmannii, which displayed one of the highest tolerances to the 
stratospheric environment in the experiments, was recently proposed to be 
adapted to airborne transportation, although such a hypothesis had not yet been 
tested. Our results strengthen such an assumption and can help explain the 
observed distribution and ecology of this particular yeast species.

The bacterial strain designated I1-1(T) was isolated from a hot spring located 
in the Pingtung area, southern Taiwan. Cells of this organism were Gram reaction 
negative rods, motile by a single polar flagellum. Optimum conditions for growth 
were 55 degrees C and pH 7. Strain I1-1(T) grew well in lower nutrient media 
such as 5-10% Luria-Bertani broth, and its extracellular products expressed 
alkaline protease activity. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicates that 
strain I1-1(T) is a member of beta-Proteobacteria. On the basis of a 
phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA sequences, DNA-DNA similarity data, whole-cell 
protein analysis, physiological and biochemical characteristics, as well as 
fatty acid compositions, the organism belonged to the genus Tepidimonas and 
represented a novel species within this genus. The predominant cellular fatty 
acids of strain I1-1(T) were 16:0 (about 41%), 18:1 omega7c (about 13%), and 
summed feature 3 [16:1 omega7c or 15:0 iso 2OH or both (about 26%)]. Its DNA 
base ratio was 68.1 mol%. We propose to classify strain I1-1(T) (=BCRC 
17406(T)=LMG 22826(T)) as Tepidimonas taiwanensis sp. nov.

Soda lakes are unique poly-extreme environments with high alkalinity and 
salinity that support diverse microbial communities despite their extreme 
nature. In this study, prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial diversity in samples 
of the three soda lakes, Lake Abijata, Lake Chitu and Lake Shala in the East 
African Rift Valley, were determined using amplicon sequencing. 
Culture-independent analysis showed higher diversity of prokaryotic and 
eukaryotic microbial communities in all three soda lakes than previously 
reported. A total of 3,603 prokaryotic and 898 eukaryotic operational taxonomic 
units (OTUs) were found through culture-independent amplicon sequencing, whereas 
only 134 bacterial OTUs, which correspond to 3%, were obtained by enrichment 
cultures. This shows that only a fraction of the microorganisms from these 
habitats can be cultured under laboratory conditions. Of the three soda lakes, 
samples from Lake Chitu showed the highest prokaryotic diversity, while samples 
from Lake Shala showed the lowest diversity. Pseudomonadota (Halomonas), 
Bacillota (Bacillus, Clostridia), Bacteroidota (Bacteroides), Euryarchaeota 
(Thermoplasmata, Thermococci, Methanomicrobia, Halobacter), and Nanoarchaeota 
(Woesearchaeia) were the most common prokaryotic microbes in the three soda 
lakes. A high diversity of eukaryotic organisms were identified, primarily 
represented by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Compared to the other two lakes, a 
higher number of eukaryotic OTUs were found in Lake Abijata. The present study 
showed that these unique habitats harbour diverse microbial genetic resources 
with possible use in biotechnological applications, which should be further 
investigated by functional metagenomics.

Gram-negative Antarctic bacteria adopt survival strategies to live and 
proliferate in an extremely cold environment. Unusual chemical modifications of 
the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the main component of their outer membrane are 
among the tricks adopted to allow the maintenance of an optimum membrane 
fluidity even at particularly low temperatures. In particular, the LPS' 
glycolipid moiety, the lipid A, typically undergoes several structural 
modifications comprising desaturation of the acyl chains, reduction in their 
length and increase in their branching. The investigation of the structure of 
the lipid A from cold-adapted bacteria is, therefore, crucial to understand the 
mechanisms underlying the cold adaptation phenomenon. Here we describe the 
structural elucidation of the highly heterogenous lipid A from three 
psychrophiles isolated from Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica. All the lipid A 
structures have been determined by merging data that was attained from the 
compositional analysis with information from a matrix-assisted laser desorption 
ionization (MALDI) time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and MS2 
investigation. As lipid A is also involved in a structure-dependent elicitation 
of innate immune response in mammals, the structural characterization of lipid A 
from such extremophile bacteria is also of great interest from the perspective 
of drug synthesis and development inspired by natural sources.

In this study, alkaliphilic family G/11 xylanase from alkali-tolerant 
filamentous fungi Penicillium citrinum MTCC 6489 was used as a model system to 
gain insight into the molecular aspects of unfolding/refolding of alkaliphilic 
glycosyl hydrolase protein family. The intrinsic protein fluorescence suggested 
a putative intermediate state of protein in presence of 2 M guanidium 
hydrochloride (GdmCl) with an emission maximum of 353 nm. Here we studied the 
refolding of GdmCl-denatured alkaline xylanase in the presence and the absence 
of a multimeric chaperone protein alpha-crystallin to elucidate the molecular 
mechanism of intramolecular interactions of the alkaliphilic xylanase protein 
that dictates its extremophilic character. Our results, based on intrinsic 
tryptophan fluorescence and hydrophobic fluorophore 8-anilino-1- naphthalene 
sulfonate-binding studies, suggest that alpha-crystallin formed a complex with a 
putative molten globule-like intermediate in the refolding pathway of xylanase 
in an ATP-independent manner. A 2 M GdmCl is sufficient to denature alkaline 
xylanase completely. The hydrodynamic radius (R(H)) of a native alkaline 
xylanase is 4.0, which becomes 5.0 in the presence of 2 M GdmCl whereas in 
presence of the higher concentration of GdmCl R(H) value was shifted to 100, 
indicating the aggregation of denatured xylanase. The alpha-crystallin.xylanase 
complex exhibited the recovery of functional activity with the extent of 
approximately 43%. Addition of ATP to the complex did not show any significant 
effect on activity recovery of the denatured protein.

Anthropogenic extreme environments are among the most interesting sites for the 
bioprospection of extremophiles since the selection pressures may favor the 
presence of microorganisms of great interest for taxonomical and astrobiological 
research as well as for bioremediation technologies and industrial applications. 
In this work, T-RFLP and 16S rRNA gene library analyses were carried out to 
describe the autochthonous bacterial populations from an industrial waste 
characterized as hyper-alkaline (pH between 9 and 14), hyper-saline (around 100 
PSU) and highly contaminated with metals, mainly chromium (from 5 to 
18 g kg(-1)) and iron (from 2 to 108 g kg(-1)). Due to matrix interference with 
DNA extraction, a protocol optimization step was required in order to carry out 
molecular analyses. The most abundant populations, as evaluated by both T-RFLP 
and 16S rRNA gene library analyses, were affiliated to Bacillus and Lysobacter 
genera. Lysobacter related sequences were present in the three samples: solid 
residue and lixiviate sediments from both dry and wet seasons. Sequences related 
to Thiobacillus were also found; although strains affiliated to this genus are 
known to have tolerance to metals, they have not previously been detected in 
alkaline environments. Together with Bacillus (already described as a metal 
reducer), such organisms could be of use in bioremediation technologies for 
reducing chromium, as well as for the prospection of enzymes of biotechnological 
interest.

Knowledge of our Planet's biosphere has increased tremendously during the last 
10 to 20 years. In the field of Microbiology in particular, scientists have 
discovered novel ""extremophiles"", microorganisms capable of living in extreme 
environments such as highly acidic or alkaline conditions, at high salt 
concentration, with no oxygen, extreme temperatures (as low as -20 degrees C and 
as high as 300 degrees C), at high concentrations of heavy metals and in high 
pressure environments such as the deep-sea. It is apparent that microorganisms 
can exist in any extreme environment of the Earth, yet already scientists have 
started to look for life on other planets; the so-called ""Exobiology"" project. 
But as yet we have little knowledge of the deep-sea and subsurface biosphere of 
our own planet. We believe that we should elucidate the Biodiversity of Earth 
more thoroughly before exploring life on other planets, and these attempts would 
provide deeper insight into clarifying the existence of extraterrestrial life. 
We focused on two deep-sea extremophiles in this article; one is ""Piezophiles"", 
and another is ""Hyperthermophiles"". Piezophiles are typical microorganisms 
adapted to high-pressure and cold temperature environments, and located in 
deep-sea bottom. Otherwise, hyperthermophiles are living in high temperature 
environment, and located at around the hydrothermal vent systems in deep-sea. 
They are not typical deep-sea microorganisms, but they can grow well at 
high-pressure condition, just like piezophiles. Deming and Baross mentioned that 
most of the hyperthermophilic archaea isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vents 
are able to grow under conditions of high temperature and pressure, and in most 
cases their optimal pressure for growth was greater than the environmental 
pressure they were isolated from. It is possible that originally their native 
environment may have been deeper than the sea floor and that there had to be a 
deeper biosphere. This implication suggests that the deep-sea hydrothermal vents 
are the windows to a deep subsurface biosphere. A vast array of chemoautotrophic 
deep-sea animal communities have been found to exist in cold seep environments, 
and most of these animals are common with those found in hydrothermal vent 
environments. Thus, it is possible to consider that the cold seeps are also one 
of slit windows to a deep subsurface biosphere. We conclude that the deep-sea 
extremophiles are very closely related into the unseen majority in subsurface 
biosphere, and the subsurface biosphere probably concerns to consider the 
""exobiology"".

Sambhar Salt Lake, situated in the state of Rajasthan, India is a unique 
temperate hypersaline ecosystem. Exploration of the salt lake microbiome will 
enable us to understand microbiome functioning in nutrient-deprived extreme 
conditions, as well as enrich our understanding of the environment-specific 
microbiome evolution. The current study has been designed to explore the Sambhar 
Salt Lake microbiome with a culture-independent multi-omics approach to define 
its metagenomic features and prevalent metabolic functionaries. The rRNA feature 
and protein feature-based phylogenetic reconstruction synchronously (R = 0.908) 
indicated the dominance of the archaea (Euryarchaeota) and bacteria (Firmicutes, 
Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria). Metabolic reconstruction 
identified selective enrichment of the protein features associated with energy 
harvesting and stress tolerance (osmotic, oxidative, metal/metalloid, heat/cold, 
antibiotic, and desiccation). Metabolites identified with metabolome analysis 
confirmed physiological adaptation of the lake microbiome within a hypersaline 
and nutrient-deprived environment. Comparative metagenomics of the 212 
metagenomes representing freshwater, alkaline, and saline ecosystem microbiome 
indicated the selective enrichment of the microbial groups and genetic features. 
The current study elucidates microbiome functioning within the nutrient-deprived 
harsh ecosystems. In summary, the current study harnessing the strength of 
multi-omics and comparative metagenomics indicates the environment-specific 
microbiome evolution.

Alkaline protease produced by the halotolerant alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain 
NPST-AK15 was purified to homogeneity by the combination of ammonium sulfate 
precipitation, anion-exchange and gel permeation chromatography. The purified 
enzyme was a monomeric protein with an estimated molecular weight of 32 kDa. 
NPST-AK15 protease was highly active and stable over a wide pH range, with a 
maximal activity at pH 10.5. The enzyme showed optimum activity at 60 °C and was 
stable at 30-50 °C for at least 1 h. Thermal stability of the purified protease 
was substantially improved by CaCl2 (1.1- to 6.6-fold). The K m, V max and k cat 
values for the enzyme were 2.5 mg ml(-1), 42.5 µM min(-1) mg(-1), and 392.46 × 
10(3) min(-1), respectively. NPST-AK15 protease activity was strongly inhibited 
by PMSF, suggesting that the enzyme is a serine protease. The enzyme was highly 
stable in NaCl up to 20 % (w/v). Moreover, the purified enzyme was stable in 
several organic solvents such as diethyl ether, benzene, toluene, and 
chloroform. In addition, it showed high stability and compatibility with a wide 
range of surfactants and commercial detergents and was slightly activated by 
hydrogen peroxide. These features of NPST-AK15 protease make this enzyme a 
promising candidate for application in the laundry and pharmaceutical 
industries.

BACKGROUND: Hypersaline soda lakes are characterized by extreme high soluble 
carbonate alkalinity. Despite the high pH and salt content, highly diverse 
microbial communities are known to be present in soda lake brines but the 
microbiome of soda lake sediments received much less attention of 
microbiologists. Here, we performed metagenomic sequencing on soda lake 
sediments to give the first extensive overview of the taxonomic diversity found 
in these complex, extreme environments and to gain novel physiological insights 
into the most abundant, uncultured prokaryote lineages.
RESULTS: We sequenced five metagenomes obtained from four surface sediments of 
Siberian soda lakes with a pH 10 and a salt content between 70 and 400 g L-1. 
The recovered 16S rRNA gene sequences were mostly from Bacteria, even in the 
salt-saturated lakes. Most OTUs were assigned to uncultured families. We 
reconstructed 871 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) spanning more than 45 
phyla and discovered the first extremophilic members of the Candidate Phyla 
Radiation (CPR). Five new species of CPR were among the most dominant community 
members. Novel dominant lineages were found within previously well-characterized 
functional groups involved in carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen cycling. Moreover, 
key enzymes of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway were encoded within at least four 
bacterial phyla never previously associated with this ancient anaerobic pathway 
for carbon fixation and dissimilation, including the Actinobacteria.
CONCLUSIONS: Our first sequencing effort of hypersaline soda lake sediment 
metagenomes led to two important advances. First, we showed the existence and 
obtained the first genomes of haloalkaliphilic members of the CPR and several 
hundred other novel prokaryote lineages. The soda lake CPR is a functionally 
diverse group, but the most abundant organisms in this study are likely 
fermenters with a possible role in primary carbon degradation. Second, we found 
evidence for the presence of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway in many more taxonomic 
groups than those encompassing known homo-acetogens, sulfate-reducers, and 
methanogens. Since only few environmental metagenomics studies have targeted 
sediment microbial communities and never to this extent, we expect that our 
findings are relevant not only for the understanding of haloalkaline 
environments but can also be used to set targets for future studies on marine 
and freshwater sediments.

Winter phytoplankton communities in the shallow alkaline pans of Hungary are 
frequently dominated by picoeukaryotes, sometimes in particularly high 
abundance. In winter 2012, the ice-covered alkaline Zab-szék pan was found to be 
extraordinarily rich in picoeukaryotic green algae (42-82 × 10(6) cells ml(-1)) 
despite the simultaneous presence of multiple stressors (low temperature and 
light intensity with high pH and salinity). The maximum photosynthetic rate of 
the picoeukaryote community was 1.4 μg C μg chlorophyll a (-1) h(-1) at 125 μmol 
m(-2) s(-1). The assimilation rates compared with the available light intensity 
measured on the field show that the community was considerably light-limited. 
Estimated areal primary production was 180 mg C m(-2) d(-1). On the basis of the 
18S rRNA gene analysis (cloning and DGGE), the community was phylogenetically 
heterogeneous with several previously undescribed chlorophyte lineages, which 
indicates the ability of picoeukaryotic communities to maintain high genetic 
diversity under extreme conditions.

Mining activities generate large quantities of wastes that significantly alter 
the biogeochemistry and ecological structure of entire river basins. Microbial 
communities that develop in these areas present a variety of survival and 
adaptation mechanisms. Knowing this diversity at the molecular level is 
strategic both for understanding adaptive processes and for identifying genomes 
with potential use in bioremediation and bioprospecting. In this work, 
prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities were evaluated by meta-taxonomics (16S 
and 18S amplicons) in sediments and water bodies impacted by acid mine drainage 
in an important coal mining area in southern Brazil. Five sampling stations were 
defined on a gradient of impacts (pH 2.7-4.25). Taxon diversity was directly 
proportional to pH, being greater in sediments than in water. The dominant 
prokaryotic phyla in the samples were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, 
Acidobacteria, OD1, Nitrospirae, and Euryarchaeota, and among the eukaryotes, 
algae (Ochrophyta, Chlorophyta, Cryptophyceae), fungi (Basidiomycota, 
Ascomycota, and Cryptomycota), and protists (Ciliophora, Heterolobosea, 
Cercozoa). The prokaryotic genera Leptospirillum, Acidithiobacillus, 
Acidiphilium, Thiomonas, Thermogymnomonas, and Acidobacterium, and the 
eukaryotic genera Pterocystis and Poteriospumella were associated with more 
acidic conditions and higher metal concentrations, while the prokaryotic genera 
Sediminibacterium, Gallionella Geothrix, and Geobacter were more abundant in 
transitional environments.

Viscum schimperi is an evergreen hemiparasitic plant that can grow on stems and 
branches of several tree species. It penetrates the host tissues and forms a 
vascular bridge (haustorium) to withdraw the nutritive resources. Its 
relationships with hosts remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the 
physiological and biochemical attributes of the host-hemiparasite association 
Acacia gerrardii -Viscum schimperi . The hemiparasite exhibited 2.4- and 
3.0-fold lower photosynthetic activity and water use efficiency, and 1.2- and 
4.1-fold higher transpiration rate and stomatal conductance. Equally, it 
displayed 4.9- and 2.6-fold greater water potential and osmotic potential, and 
in least 3.0times more accumulated 39 K, 85 Rb and 51 V, compared to the host. 
Nevertheless, it had no detrimental effect on photosynthetic activity, water 
status and multi-element accumulations in the host. Based on metabolome 
profiling, V. schimperi could use xanthurenic acid and propylparaben to acquire 
potassium from the host, and N -1-naphthylacetamide and N -Boc-hydroxylamine to 
weaken or kill the distal part of the infected branch and to receive the total 
xylem contents. In contrast, A. gerrardii could used N -acetylserotonin, 
arecoline, acetophenone and 6-methoxymellein to defend against V. schimperi 
infection.

Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) has long been known to support anaerobic respiration in 
a few species of basically aerobic extremely halophilic euryarchaea living in 
hypersaline lakes. Recently, it has also been shown to be utilized as an 
additional electron acceptor in basically anaerobic sulfur-reducing haloarchaea. 
Here we investigated whether haloarchaea would be capable of anaerobic 
respiration with other two sulfoxides, methionine sulfoxide (MSO) and 
tetramethylene sulfoxide (TMSO). For this, anaerobic enrichment cultures were 
inoculated with sediments from hypersaline salt and soda lakes in southwestern 
Siberia and southern Russia. Positive enrichments were obtained for both MSO and 
TMSO with yeast extract but not with formate or acetate as the electron donor. 
Two pure cultures obtained from salt lakes, either with MSO or TMSO, were 
obligate anaerobes closely related to sulfur-reducing Halanaeroarchaeum 
sulfurireducens, although the type strain of this genus was unable to utilize 
any sulfoxides. Two pure cultures isolated from soda lakes were facultatively 
anaerobic alkaliphilic haloarchaea using O2, sulfur and sulfoxides as the 
electron acceptors. One isolate was identical to the previously described 
sulfur-reducing Natrarchaeobaculum sulfurireducens, while another one, enriched 
at lower alkalinity, is forming a new species in the genus Halobiforma. Since 
all isolates enriched with either MSO or TMSO were able to respire all three 
sulfoxides including DMSO and the corresponding activities were cross-induced, 
it suggest that a single enzyme of the DMSO-reductase family with a broad 
substrate specificity is responsible for various sulfoxide-dependent respiration 
in haloarchaea.

Three novel Gram-positive, endospore-forming bacteria were isolated from a cold 
and alkaline environment. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the strains were 
almost identical, and that they were related to Natronobacillus azotifigens 
24KS-1(T) (95.8% identity), Paraliobacillus quinghaiensis YIM-C158(T) (95.1%), 
Paraliobacillus ryukyuensis O15-7(T) (94.5%), and Halolactibacillus miurensis 
M23-1(T) (93.9%). The isolates produced amylase, α-galactosidase, 
β-galactosidase, and β-glucuronidase, and showed optimal growth at pH 10, at 
20°C, and at 2-8% (w/v) NaCl. Major fatty acids were C(14:0) (10.6-11.6%), 
anteiso-C(15:0) (25.7-32.7%), C(16:1) ω11c (12.2-16.0%), and C(16:0) 
(14.0-20.4%). The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol and 
phosphatidylglycerol, and meso-diaminopimelic acid was found in the cell-wall 
peptidoglycan. The G+C content was 38.4%. DNA-DNA hybridization between strain 
GCM68(T) and H. miurensis M23-1(T) was 32.4%, while hybridization to N. 
azotifigens 24KS-1(T), Amphibacillus tropicus Z-7792(T), and Paraliobacillus 
ryukyuensis O15-7(T) was below 30%. The phylogenetic analysis and G+C content 
place strain GCM68(T) in relation to species belonging to Bacillus rRNA group 1, 
but phylogenetic and physiologic data combined with chemotaxonomic analyses 
support our proposal for a new genus, Alkalilactibacillus, gen. nov., with the 
novel species Alkalilactibacillus ikkensis, sp. nov. (type strain is 
GCM68(T) = DSM 19937 = LMG 24405).

Amylases and proteases are among the industrially most important enzymes for 
food processing, animal feed, brewing, starch processing, detergents, 
healthcare, leather processing, and biofuel production. In this study, we 
investigated the growth kinetics and statistically optimized the co-production 
of amylase and protease in a phylogenetically novel haloalkaliphilic 
actinomycete, Streptomyces lopnurensis KaM5 of seawater. The Plackett-Berman 
design using Minitab 14.0 software was employed to assess the impact of the 
nutritional factors, temperature, pH, and incubation time. Further, starch, 
yeast extract, NaCl concentrations, and incubation time were optimized by 
Box-Behnken design at their three levels. The Pareto charts, contour, surface 
plots, and individual factorial analysis expressed the variability and levels 
for the optimal enzyme production. ANOVA analysis admitted the statistical 
fitness and significance level among the variables. A two-fold increase in 
enzyme production was achieved by cost-effective co-production media. The study 
was further extended to growth kinetics associated with enzyme production. 
Specific growth rate (μ), maximal cell mass (Xmax), volumetric product formation 
(Pmax), rate of product formation (Qp), and generation time (g) were computed 
and analyzed. These parameters significantly improved when compared with the 
pre-optimized conditions, and the production economics of the enzyme was 
industrially viable. The initial studies on the characteristics of the enzymes 
suggested its ability to function under the combination of alkaline pH and high 
salt concentrations. The co-production of enzymes from extremophiles can be a 
potentially viable option for large-scale production and applications.

Alkaline sulfur hot springs notable for their specialized and complex ecosystem 
powered by geothermal energy are abundantly rich in different chemotrophic and 
phototrophic thermophilic microorganisms. Survival and adaptation of these 
organisms in the extreme environment is specifically related to energy 
metabolism. To gain a better understanding of survival mechanism of the 
organisms in these ecosystems, we determined the different gene encoding enzymes 
associated with anaerobic pathways of energy metabolism by applying the 
metatranscriptomics approach. The analysis of the microbial population of hot 
sulfur spring revealed the presence of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms 
indicating dual mode of lifestyle of the community members. Proteobacteria 
(28.1 %) was the most dominant community. A total of 988 reads were associated 
with energy metabolism, out of which 33.7 % of the reads were assigned to 
nitrogen, sulfur, and methane metabolism based on KEGG classification. The major 
lineages of hot spring communities were linked with the anaerobic pathways. 
Different gene encoding enzymes (hao, nir, nar, cysH, cysI, acs) showed the 
involvement of microbial members in nitrification, denitrification, 
dissimilatory sulfate reduction, and methane generation. This study enhances our 
understanding of important gene encoding enzymes involved in energy metabolism, 
required for the survival and adaptation of microbial communities in the hot 
spring.

Alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain KSM-K16, which produces high-alkaline 
M-protease, was characterized phenotypically, biochemically and genetically. 
This strain was identified as Bacillus clausii based on the results of taxonomic 
studies, including sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and DNA-DNA hybridization. 
Seven rRNA operons in the genome were identified by pulsed-field gel 
electrophoresis. Sequencing of cloned 16S rRNA genes revealed two distinct types 
of variable region V1. Moreover, some cloned 16S rRNA genes in some of the 
reference strains of B. clausii had a V1 region of yet another type. The B. 
clausii strains could clearly be divided into at least two subgroups based on 
the frequencies of the types of cloned V1 sequence. Bacillus sp. strain KSM-K16 
was found to be in a different phylogenetic position from other high-alkaline 
protease-producing strains of B. clausii.

New strains of sulfate-reducing bacteria were isolated from two alkaline 
brackish lakes located in the Siberian region of Russia, namely in the Southern 
Transbaikalia, Buriatia. The article presents data describing morphology, 
physiology, and biochemical characteristics of the isolated strains. These 
strains Ki4, Ki5, and Su2 were mesophilic and alkaliphilic with optimal growth 
at pH 8.9, 9.4, and 10.0, respectively. All isolated strains utilized lactate, 
formate, and ethanol in the presence of sulfate for growth and sulfidogenesis 
accompanied with formation of acetate and CO2. Strains Ki5 and Su2 were able to 
reduce Fe(III). The DNA G + C content in strains Ki4, Ki5 and Su2 was 56.3, 48.8 
and 59.6 mol%, respectively. According to phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA 
sequences, the new strains were clustered within the genus Desulfonatronum, and 
the closest relative D. lacustre Z-7951(T) (=DSM 10312(T)) showed 99.3-99.6 % 
similarity. DNA-DNA relatedness values of the strains Ki4, Ki5, and Su2 with D. 
lacustre Z-7951(T) were 89, 53, and 79 %, respectively. Polyphasic taxonomy data 
suggest that strain Ki5(T) is representative of the proposed novel species 
Desulfonatronum buryatense sp. nov.

The soil of the former Lake Texcoco is a saline alkaline environment where 
anthropogenic drainage in some areas has reduced salt content and pH. Potential 
methane (CH4) consumption rates were measured in three soils of the former Lake 
Texcoco with different electrolytic conductivity (EC) and pH, i.e. Tex-S1 a >18 
years drained soil (EC 0.7 dS m(-1), pH 8.5), Tex-S2 drained for ~10 years (EC 
9.0 dS m(-1), pH 10.3) and the undrained Tex-S3 (EC 84.8 dS m(-1), pH 10.3). An 
arable soil from Alcholoya (EC 0.7 dS m(-1), pH 6.7), located nearby Lake 
Texcoco was used as control. Methane oxidation in the soil Tex-S1 (lowest EC and 
pH) was similar to that in the arable soil from Alcholoya (32.5 and 34.7 mg CH4 
kg(-1) dry soil day(-1), respectively). Meanwhile, in soils Tex-S2 and Tex-S3, 
the potential CH4 oxidation rates were only 15.0 and 12.8 mg CH4 kg(-1) dry soil 
day(-1), respectively. Differences in CH4 oxidation were also related to changes 
in the methane-oxidizing communities in these soils. Sequence analysis of pmoA 
gene showed that soils differed in the identity and number of methanotrophic 
phylotypes. The Alcholoya soil and Tex-S1 contained phylotypes grouped within 
the upland soil cluster gamma and the Jasper Ridge, California JR-2 clade. In 
soil Tex-S3, a phylotype related to Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum was detected.

Endoxylanases active under extreme conditions of temperature and alkalinity can 
replace the use of highly pollutant chemicals in the pulp and paper industry. 
Searching for enzymes with these properties, we carried out a comprehensive 
bioinformatics study of the GH10 family. The phylogenetic analysis allowed the 
construction of a radial cladogram in which protein sequences putatively 
ascribed as thermophilic and alkaliphilic appeared grouped in a well-defined 
region of the cladogram, designated TAK Cluster. One among five TAK sequences 
selected for experimental analysis (Xyn11) showed extraordinary xylanolytic 
activity under simultaneous conditions of high temperature (90 °C) and 
alkalinity (pH 10.5). Addition of a carbohydrate binding domain (CBM2) at the 
C-terminus of the protein sequence further improved the activity of the enzyme 
at high pH. Xyn11 structure, which has been solved at 1.8 Å resolution by X-ray 
crystallography, reveals an unusually high number of hydrophobic, ionic and 
hydrogen bond atomic interactions that could account for the enzyme's 
extremophilic nature.

Bacterial microorganisms that grow optimally at Na+ concentrations of 1.7 M, or 
the equivalent of 10% (w/v) NaCl, and greater are considered to be extreme 
halophiles. This review focuses on the correlation between the extent of 
alkaline pH and elevated temperature optima and the extent of salt tolerance of 
extremely halophilic eubacteria; the focus is on those with alkaline pH optima, 
above 8.5, and elevated temperature optima, above 50 degrees C. If all three 
conditions are required for optimal growth, these microorganisms are termed 
""poly-extremophiles"". However, only a very few extreme halophiles able to grow 
optimally under alkaline conditions as well as at elevated temperatures have 
been isolated so far. Therefore the question is: do the combined extreme growth 
conditions of the recently isolated poly-extremophiles, i.e., anaerobic 
halophilic alkalithermophiles, approach a physico-chemical boundary for life? 
These poly-extremophiles are of interest, as their adaptive mechanisms give 
insight into organisms' abilities to survive in environments which were 
previously considered prohibitive to life, as well as to possible properties of 
early evolutionary and extraterrestrial life forms.

Laguna Verde's dome-shaped structures are distinctive formations within the 
Central Andes, displaying unique geomicrobiological features. This study 
represents a pioneering investigation into these structures, assessing their 
formation, associated taxa, and ecological significance. Through a multifaceted 
approach that includes chemical analysis of the water body, multiscale 
characterization of the domes, and analysis of the associated microorganisms, we 
reveal the complex interplay between geology and biology in this extreme 
environment. The lake's alkaline waters that are rich in dissolved cations and 
anions such as chloride, sodium sulfate, and potassium, coupled with its 
location at the margin of the Antofalla salt flat, fed by alluvial fans and 
hydrothermal input, provide favorable conditions for mineral precipitation and 
support for the microorganism's activity. Laguna Verde's dome-shaped structures 
are mainly composed of gypsum and halite, displaying an internal heterogeneous 
mesostructure consisting of three zones: microcrystalline, organic (orange and 
green layers), and crystalline. The green layer of the organic zone is 
predominantly composed of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria, 
while the orange layer is mostly inhabited by Cyanobacteria. The results of the 
study suggest that oxygenic photosynthesis performed by Cyanobacteria is the 
main carbon fixation pathway in the microbial community, supported by carbon 
isotopic ratios of specific biomarkers. This finding highlights the important 
role played by Cyanobacteria in this ecosystem.

The presence of a periplasmic space within the cell envelope of Thermus 
thermophilus was analyzed in a mutant (HB8(Delta)UTR1) defective in the 
regulation of its S-layer (surface crystalline layer). This mutant forms round 
multicellular bodies (MBs) surrounded by a common envelope as the culture 
approaches the stationary phase. Confocal microscopy revealed that the origin of 
the MBs is the progressive detachment of the external layers coupled with the 
accumulation of NH(2)-containing material between the external envelopes and the 
peptidoglycan. A specific pattern of proteins was found as soluble components of 
the intercellular space of the MBs by a single fractionation procedure, 
suggesting that they are periplasmic-like components. To demonstrate this, we 
cloned a gene ( phoA) from T. thermophilus HB8 encoding a signal peptide-wearing 
alkaline phosphatase (AP), and engineered it to be overexpressed in the mutant 
from a shuttle vector. Most of the AP activity (>80%) was found as a soluble 
component of the MBs' intercellular fraction. All these data indicate that 
Thermus thermophilus actually has a periplasmic space which is functionally 
similar to that of Proteobacteria. The potential application of the 
HB8(Delta)UTR1 mutant for the overexpression of periplasmic thermophilic 
proteins is discussed.

Extracellular lipase was isolated and purified from the culture broth of 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an extremophile which naturally grows in water-soluble 
mineral cutting oil (pH 10) used as metalworking fluid (MWF) for cooling and 
lubrication in industrial metalworking processes. The molecular mass of the 
purified lipase was estimated by SDS-PAGE to be 54 kDa. The optimum pH and 
temperature were 11 and 70 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme is stabile over a 
broad pH range (pH 4-11.5). The lipase preferably acted on triacylglycerols with 
medium-chain fatty acids. The lipase was inhibited strongly by Zn(2+), Hg(2+), 
Cu(2+) and slightly by Ca(2+) and Mg(2+). Non-ionic detergents and 
sodiumdeoxycholate enhanced lipase activity. Alkaline lipase from P. aeruginosa, 
capable of growing in a water-restricted medium has excellent properties and 
good potential for biotechnological applications in the metal industry. Its 
marked stability and activity in organic solvents suggest that this lipase is 
highly suitable as a biotechnological tool in a water-restricted medium with a 
variety of applications including organosynthetic reactions and the control and 
prevention of MWF putrification in the metal industry.

INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens pose serious challenges to 
healthcare institutions and health of the public. Thus, there is an urgent need 
for the discovery of new and effective antimicrobial agents. Microorganisms that 
exist in extreme environments such as those with high salinity or alkalinity, 
are known as extremophiles, and include various species of actinomycetes. The 
goal of this study is to discover novel antibiotics from extremophiles found in 
Kazakhstan that are effective against drug resistant pathogens.
METHODS: Soil from extreme environments of Kazakhstan was collected, and pure 
cultures of actinomycetes were isolated and cultured in modified Bennett's broth 
with either high concentrations of salt or high pH to mimic extreme 
environments. Extracts obtained from selected actinomycetes strains were used to 
test for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli 
and Aspergillus niger.
RESULTS: A total of 5936 strains of extremophile actinomycetes were isolated; 
from these, 2019 strains were further isolated into pure cultures. Of these, 415 
actinomycetes strains that demonstrated antagonistic antibacterial activities 
were selected. These actinomycetes were further classified into groups and 
subgroups based on their responses to different culture conditions. 
Antimicrobial antagonism activity for some of the actinomycetes strains was 
dependent on culture conditions and development of aerial mycelia under extreme 
conditions.
CONCLUSION: We identified several interesting candidate extracts with putative 
antimicrobial activities against several strains of drug resistant pathogens. 
Our research of the actinomycetes' ability to produce antibiotics in the 
near-natural conditions provides a great opportunity to assess their 
biodiversity and distribution in the Central Asian region and to develop new 
methodological approaches to the screening of new antimicrobial agents.

We investigated population structure and arsenic bioaccumulation and 
distribution in zooplankton inhabiting highly contaminated freshwater with 
arsenic. We collected water and zooplankton samples over a 4 year period, 
determined environmental temperature as well as water temperature, pH, 
electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), oxidation-reduction 
potential (ORP), dissolved oxygen (DO), major cations and anions and total 
arsenic concentration. We identified zooplankton species and determined their 
abundance, length, sex ratios, and arsenic bioaccumulation and distribution in 
exposed organisms. At the study site, an extremophile, Paracyclops chiltoni, was 
found to survive in an environment with high concentration of arsenic, sulfate 
and fluoride in freshwater as a well-adapted organism. Results showed that the 
average arsenic concentration in freshwater was 53.64 ± 10.58 mg/L. Exposed 
organisms of Paracyclops chiltoni showed arsenic accumulation (up to 9.6 ± 5.4 
mgAs/kg) in its body, likely in the digestive tract as well as typical abundance 
and length, which showed a relationship to environmental temperature and oxic 
conditions in freshwater. Metallotolerant copepods might help to better 
understand if arsenic methylation processes occur in freshwater aquatic 
organisms.

Halorhodospira (Hlr.) halochloris is a unique phototrophic purple bacterium 
because it is a triple extremophile-the organism is thermophilic, alkalophilic, 
and halophilic. The most striking photosynthetic feature of Hlr. halochloris is 
that the bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) b-containing core light-harvesting (LH1) 
complex surrounding its reaction center (RC) exhibits its LH1 Qy absorption 
maximum at 1016 nm, which is the lowest transition energy among phototrophic 
organisms. Here we report that this extraordinarily red-shifted LH1 Qy band of 
Hlr. halochloris exhibits interconvertible spectral shifts depending on the 
electrostatic charge distribution around the BChl b molecules. The 1016 nm band 
of the Hlr. halochloris LH1-RC complex was blue-shifted to 958 nm upon desalting 
or pH decrease but returned to its original position when supplemented with 
salts or pH increase. Resonance Raman analysis demonstrated that these 
interconvertible spectral shifts are not associated with the strength of 
hydrogen-bonding interactions between BChl b and LH1 polypeptides. Furthermore, 
circular dichroism signals for the LH1 Qy transition of Hlr. halochloris 
appeared with a positive sign (as in BChl b-containing Blastochloris species) 
and opposite those of BChl a-containing purple bacteria, possibly due to a 
combined effect of slight differences in the transition dipole moments between 
BChl a and BChl b and in the interactions between adjacent BChls in their 
assembled state. Based on these findings and LH1 amino acid sequences, it is 
proposed that Hlr. halochloris evolved its unique and tunable light-harvesting 
system with electrostatic charges in order to carry out photosynthesis and 
thrive in its punishing hypersaline and alkaline habitat.

Viviparity, a reproductive form that supplies nutrients to the embryo during 
gestation, has repeatedly and independently occurred in multiple lineages of 
animals. During the convergent evolution of viviparity, various modifications of 
development, structure, and physiology emerged. A new species of nematode, 
Tokorhabditis tufae, was discovered in the alkaline, hypersaline, and 
arsenic-rich environment of Mono lake. Its reproductive form is viviparity 
because it is obligately live-bearing and the embryo increases in size during 
development. However, the magnitude of the increase in size and nutrient 
provisioning are unclear. We measured egg and embryo sizes at three 
developmental stages in T. tufae. Eggs and embryos of T. tufae at the threefold 
stage were respectively 2.6- and 3.6-fold larger than at the single-cell stage. 
We then obtained T. tufae embryos at the single-cell, lima bean, and threefold 
developmental stages and investigated the egg hatching frequency at three 
different concentrations of egg salt buffer. Removal of embryos from the uterus 
halted embryonic development at the single-cell and lima bean stages in T. tufae 
irrespective of the solution used for incubation, indicating the provision of 
nutrients within the uterus. Ultrastructural and permeability evaluation showed 
that the permeability barrier did not form during embryonic development, 
resulting in increased molecular permeability. This high permeability caused by 
the absence of the permeability barrier likely enables supply of nutrients from 
the mother. The structural and physiological modifications in T. tufae are like 
those in other viviparous animals. We conclude that T. tufae is a viviparous 
rather than an ovoviviparous nematode. T. tufae will facilitate investigation of 
the evolution of viviparity in animals.

Populus euphratica Oliv. has a high tolerance for drought, salinity, and 
alkalinity. The main purpose of this study is to explore the effects of 
environments of different salinity intensities on endophytic community structure 
and the possible roles of endophytes in the tolerance of host plants. The 
characterization of endogenous bacteria in diversity has been investigated by 
using the Illumina high-throughput sequencing technique. The research showed 
that endophytic bacteria of P. euphratica in an extremely saline environment had 
low species diversity, especially in sap tissue. The dominant phyla in all 
groups were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Notably, 
Firmicutes (relative abundance >5%) was a different dominant phylum in the 
samples from the high-saline environment compared with the relatively 
low-saline-environment group. The linear discriminant analysis effect size 
(LEfSe) analysis found that there were significant differences in different 
saline environments of Cytophagaceae (family), Rhodobacteraceae (family), and 
Rhodobacterales (order). These results indicated that the composition of the 
endogenous bacterial community was related to the growth environment of host 
plants. The predictive analysis of KEGG pathways and enzymes showed that the 
abundance of some enzymes and metabolic pathways of endophytes of P. euphratica 
increased with the increase of soil salinity, and most of the enzymes were 
related to energy metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism. These findings 
suggested that the endogenous bacteria of the host plant had different 
expression mechanisms under different degrees of stress, and this mechanism was 
very obvious in the distribution of endophytes, while the function of the 
endogenous bacteria needs to be further explored. IMPORTANCE Euphrates poplar 
(Populus euphratica Oliv.), as the only tree species that grows in the desert, 
has tenacious vitality with the characteristics of cold tolerance, drought 
tolerance, salt-alkali tolerance, and wind-sand resistance. P. euphratica has a 
long growth cycle and a high growth rate, which can break wind, fix sand, green 
the environment, and protect farmland, making it an important afforestation tree 
species in arid and semiarid areas. The area of P. euphratica in Xinjiang 
accounts for 91.1% of its area in China. Studying the endophytic bacteria of P. 
euphratica can give people a systematic understanding of it and the adaptability 
of the endogenous flora to the host and special environments. In this study, by 
analyzing the endophytic bacteria of P. euphratica in different saline-alkali 
regions of Xinjiang, it was found that the bacteria in different tissues of P. 
euphratica changed with the change of soil salinity. Especially in the sap 
tissue of P. euphratica under extremely high salinity, the diversity of 
endogenous bacteria was significantly lower than that in other tissues. These 
differential bacteria under different salinities were mostly related to the 
stress resistance of themselves and the host. Not only that, we also selected a 
strain of Bacillus with high stress resistance from the tissues of P. 
euphratica, which can survive under the extreme conditions of 10% NaCl and pH 
11. We obtained a genome completion map of this strain, named it Bacillus 
haynesii P19 (GenBank accession no. PRJNA648288), and tried to use it for 
fermentation but in a different work, so as to develop it into a promising 
industrial fermentation chassis bacterium. Therefore, this study was of great 
significance for the understanding of endophytic bacteria in P. euphratica and 
the acquisition of extremophilic microbial resources.

Water availability acts as the most stringent constraint for life on Earth. 
Thus, understanding the water relations of microbial extremophiles is imperative 
to our ability to increase agricultural productivity (e.g., by enhancing the 
processing and turnover of dead organic matter in soils of arid regions), reduce 
human exposure to mycotoxins in buildings and our food-supply chain, prevent the 
spoilage of foods/animal feeds, books, museum specimens and artworks and better 
control microbiology of industrial fermentations. Only a small number of 
microbial systems can retain activity at <0.710 water activity (ISME J 2015 9: 
1333-1351). It has long-been considered that the most resilient of these is 
Xeromyces bisporus, which inhabits sugar-rich substrates (Appl Environ Microbiol 
1968 16: 1853-1858). The current study focused on germination of Aspergillus 
penicillioides, a xerophile which is also able to grow under low humidity and 
saline conditions. Investigations of germination differed from those reported 
earlier: firstly, aerially borne conidia were harvested, and then used for 
inoculations, in their dry condition; secondly, cultures were incubated at 24°C, 
i.e. below optimum germination temperature, to minimize the possibility of water 
loss from the substrate; thirdly, cultures remained sealed throughout the 73-day 
study period (microscopic examination was carried out directly 48 through the 
Petri plate lid); fourthly, the germination parameters determined were: rates 
and extent of conidial swelling, production of differentiated 
germination-structures and septate germlings, and subsequent development of 
mycelium and/or sporulation; fifthly, assessments were carried out over a range 
of water-activity values and time points to obtain a complete profile of the 
germination process. Conidia swelled, formed differentiated 
germination-structures and then produced septate germlings at a water-activity 
of just 0.585 (≡58.5% relative humidity), outside the currently understood 
thermodynamic window for life. Furthermore, analyses of these data suggest a 
theoretical water-activity minimum of 0.565 for germination of A. penicilliodes. 
In relation to astrobiology, these findings have an application in understanding 
the limits to life in extraterrestrial environments. In light of current plans 
for exploration missions to Mars and other places, and the need to safeguard 
martian scientific sites and potential resources (including water) for future 
human habitation, a knowledge-based and effective policy for planetary 
protection is essential. As it is, Mars-bound spacecraft may frequently be 
contaminated with aspergilli (including A. penicillioides) and other organisms 
which, when transported to other planetary bodies, pose a contamination risk. In 
crafting countermeasures to offset this, it is important to know as precisely as 
possible the capabilities of these potential interplanetary visitors.

Canavalia rosea, distributed in the coastal areas of tropical and subtropical 
regions, is an extremophile halophyte with good adaptability to high 
salinity/alkaline and drought tolerance. Plant sodium/hydrogen (Na+/H+) 
exchanger (NHX) genes encode membrane transporters involved in sodium ion (Na+), 
potassium ion (K+), and lithium ion (Li+) transport and pH homeostasis, thereby 
playing key roles in salinity tolerance. However, the NHX family has not been 
reported in this leguminous halophyte. In the present study, a genome-wide 
comprehensive analysis was conducted and finally eight CrNHXs were identified in 
C. rosea genome. Based on the bioinformatics analysis about the chromosomal 
location, protein domain, motif organization, and phylogenetic relationships of 
CrNHXs and their coding proteins, as well as the comparison with plant NHXs from 
other species, the CrNHXs were grouped into three major subfamilies (Vac-, 
Endo-, and PM-NHX). Promoter analyses of cis-regulatory elements indicated that 
the expression of different CrNHXs was affected by a series of stress 
challenges. Six CrNHXs showed high expression levels in five tested tissues of 
C. rosea in different levels, while CrNHX1 and CrNHX3 were expressed at 
extremely low levels, indicating that CrNHXs might be involved in regulating the 
development of C. rosea plant. The expression analysis based on RNA-seq showed 
that the transcripts of most CrNHXs were obviously decreased in mature leaves of 
C. rosea plant growing on tropical coral reefs, which suggested their 
involvement in this species' adaptation to reefs and specialized islands 
habitats. Furthermore, in the single-factor stress treatments mimicking the 
extreme environments of tropical coral reefs, the RNA-seq data also implied 
CrNHXs holding possible gene-specific regulatory roles in the environmental 
adaptation. The qRT-PCR based expression profiling exhibited that CrNHXs 
responded to different stresses to varying degrees, which further confirmed the 
specificity of CrNHXs' in responding to abiotic stresses. Moreover, the yeast 
functional complementation test proved that some CrNHXs could partially restore 
the salt tolerance of the salt-sensitive yeast mutant AXT3. This study provides 
comprehensive bio-information and primary functional identification of NHXs in 
C. rosea, which could help improve the salt/alkaline tolerance of genetically 
modified plants for further studies. This research also contributes to our 
understanding of the possible molecular mechanism whereby NHXs maintain the ion 
balance in the natural ecological adaptability of C. rosea to tropical coral 
islands and reefs.

Ionic liquids have been successfully proposed to modify membrane permeability in 
cultures of a model extremophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB27, which 
makes up the first time that aqueous solutions of these molten salts are applied 
in downstream stages of this kind of microorganisms. The presence of 1g/L of 
C10MIMCl entails a great solubilisation of cell biomass, thus allowing the 
release of intracellular and membrane-bound enzyme. The influence on the enzyme 
activity of two inorganic salts such as Na2CO3 and (NH4)2SO4, selected on the 
basis of their high salting out potential and biocompatibility with enzymes, 
respectively, was investigated. In parallel, their ability to trigger phase 
segregation was confirmed in the presence of the enzyme crude, leading to very 
high levels of enzyme extraction (96%). The validity of the strategy was 
confirmed by operating at bioreactor scale, and the main bioprocess parameters 
were obtained by modelling the experimental data.

Fungal communities represent an indispensable part of the geothermal spring 
ecosystem; however, studies on fungal community within hot springs are still 
scant. Here, we used Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing to detect fungal community 
diversity in extremely acidic hot springs (pH < 4) and neutral and alkaline 
springs (pH > 6) of Tengchong-indicated by the presence of over 0.75 million 
valid reads. These sequences were phylogenetically assigned to 5 fungal phyla, 
67 order, and 375 genera, indicating unexpected fungal diversity in the hot 
springs. The genera such as Penicillium, Entyloma, and Cladosporium dominated 
the fungal community in the acidic geothermal springs, while the groups such as 
Penicillium, Engyodontium, and Schizophyllum controlled the fungal assemblages 
in the alkaline hot springs. The alpha-diversity indices and the abundant fungal 
taxa were significantly correlated with physicochemical factors of the hot 
springs particularly pH, temperature, and concentrations of Fe2+, NH4+, NO 2-, 
and S2-, suggesting that the diversity and distribution of fungal assemblages 
can be influenced by the complex environmental factors of hot springs.

Due to its topographical position and climatic conditions, the Qinghai-Tibet 
Plateau possesses abundant microorganism resources. The extremophilic strain 
KKD1 isolated from Hoh Xil possesses strong stress tolerance, enabling it to 
propagate under high salinity (13%) and alkalinity (pH 10.0) conditions. In 
addition, KKD1 exhibits promising biocontrol activity against plant pathogens. 
To further explore these traits at the genomic level, we performed whole-genome 
sequencing and analysis. The taxonomic identification according to the average 
nucleotide identity based on BLAST revealed that KKD1 belongs to Bacillus 
halotolerans. Genetic screening of KKD1 revealed that its stress resistance 
mechanism depends on osmotic equilibrium, membrane transportation, and the 
regulation of ion balance under salt and alkaline stress. The expression of 
genes involved in these pathways was analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR. 
The presence of different gene clusters encoding antimicrobial secondary 
metabolites indicated the various pathways by which KKD1 suppresses 
phytopathogenic growth. Moreover, the lipopeptides surfactin and fengycin were 
identified as being significant antifungal components of KKD1. Through 
comparative genomics analysis, we noticed that KKD1 harbored specific genes 
involved in stress resistance and biocontrol, thus providing a new perspective 
on the genomic features of the extremophilic Bacillus species.

Although several species of purple sulfur bacteria inhabit soda lakes, Rhodobaca 
bogoriensis is the first purple nonsulfur bacterium cultured from such highly 
alkaline environments. Rhodobaca bogoriensis strain LBB1T was isolated from Lake 
Bogoria, a soda lake in the African Rift Valley. The phenotype of Rhodobaca 
bogoriensis is unique among purple bacteria; the organism is alkaliphilic but 
not halophilic, produces carotenoids absent from other purple nonsulfur 
bacteria, and is unable to grow autotrophically or fix molecular nitrogen. Here 
we analyze the draft genome sequence of Rhodobaca bogoriensis to gain further 
insight into the biology of this extremophilic purple bacterium. The strain 
LBB1T genome consists of 3.91 Mbp with no plasmids. The genome sequence supports 
the defining characteristics of strain LBB1T, including its (1) production of a 
light-harvesting 1-reaction center (LH1-RC) complex but lack of a peripheral 
(LH2) complex, (2) ability to synthesize unusual carotenoids, (3) capacity for 
both phototrophic (anoxic/light) and chemotrophic (oxic/dark) energy 
metabolisms, (4) utilization of a wide variety of organic compounds (including 
acetate in the absence of a glyoxylate cycle), (5) ability to oxidize both 
sulfide and thiosulfate despite lacking the capacity for autotrophic growth, and 
(6) absence of a functional nitrogen-fixation system for diazotrophic growth. 
The assortment of properties in Rhodobaca bogoriensis has no precedent among 
phototrophic purple bacteria, and the results are discussed in relation to the 
organism's soda lake habitat and evolutionary history.

Decompressional boiling of ascending hydrothermal waters and separation into a 
vapor (gas) and a liquid phase drive extensive variation in the geochemical 
composition of hot spring waters. Yet little is known of how the process of 
phase separation influences the distribution of microbial metabolisms in 
springs. Here, we determined the variation in protein coding genes in 51 
metagenomes from chemosynthetic hot spring communities that span geochemical 
gradients in Yellowstone National Park. The 51 metagenomes could be divided into 
5 distinct groups that correspond to low and high temperatures and acidic and 
circumneutral/alkaline springs. A fifth group primarily comprised metagenomes 
from springs with moderate acidity and that are influenced by elevated volcanic 
gas input. Protein homologs putatively involved in the oxidation of sulfur 
compounds, a process that leads to acidification of spring waters, in addition 
to those involved in the reduction of sulfur compounds were enriched in 
metagenomes from acidic springs sourced by vapor phase gases. Metagenomes from 
springs with evidence for elevated volcanic gas input were enriched in protein 
homologs putatively involved in oxidation of those gases, including hydrogen and 
methane. Finally, metagenomes from circumneutral/alkaline springs sourced by 
liquid phase waters were enriched in protein homologs putatively involved in 
heterotrophy and respiration of oxidized nitrogen compounds and oxygen. These 
results indicate that the geological process of phase separation shapes the 
ecology of thermophilic communities through its influence on the availability of 
nutrients in the form of gases, solutes, and minerals. Microbial acidification 
of hot spring waters further influences the kinetic and thermodynamic 
stabilities of nutrients and their bioavailability. These data therefore provide 
an important framework to understand how geological processes have shaped the 
evolutionary history of chemosynthetic thermophiles and how these organisms, in 
turn, have shaped their geochemical environments.

Cyanidiophytina are a group of polyextremophilic red algae with a worldwide, but 
discontinuous colonization. They are restricted to widely dispersed hot springs, 
geothermal habitats, and also some human-altered environments. Cyanidiophytina 
are predominant where pH is prohibitive for the majority of eukaryotes (pH 
0.5-3). Turkey is characterized by areas rich in volcanic activity separated by 
non-volcanic areas. Here we show that Cyanidiophycean populations are present in 
thermal baths located around Turkey on neutral/alkaline soils. All known genera 
and species within Cyanidiophytina were detected in Turkey, including Galdieria 
phlegrea, recorded up to now only in Italian Phlegrean Fields. By phylogenetic 
analyses, Turkish G. sulphuraria strains are monophyletic with Italian and 
Icelandic strains, and with Russian G. daedala strains. G. maxima from Turkey 
clustered with Icelandic, Kamchatka, and Japanese populations. The discovery of 
Cyanidiophytina in non-acidic Turkish soils raises new questions about the 
ecological boundaries of these extremophilic algae. This aids in the 
understanding of the dispersal abilities and distribution patterns of this 
ecologically and evolutionarily interesting group of algae.

The survival of microorganisms within a cementitious geological disposal 
facility for radioactive wastes heavily depends on their ability to survive the 
calcium-dominated, hyperalkaline conditions resulting from the dissolution of 
the cementitious materials. The results from this study show that the formation 
of flocs, composed of a complex mixture of extracellular polymeric substances 
(EPS), provides protection against alkaline pH values up to 13.0. The flocs were 
dominated by Alishewanella and Dietzia spp., producing a mannose-rich 
carbohydrate fraction incorporating extracellular DNA, resulting in Ca2+ 
sequestration. EPS provided a ∼10-μm thick layer around the cells within the 
center of the flocs, which were capable of growth at pH values of 11.0 and 11.5, 
maintaining internal pH values of 10.4 and 10.7, respectively. Microorganisms 
survived at a pH of 12.0, where an internal floc pH of 11.6 was observed, as was 
a reduced associated biomass. We observed limited floc survival (<2 weeks) at a 
pH of 13.0. This study demonstrates that flocs maintain lower internal pHs in 
response to the hyperalkaline conditions expected to occur within a cementitious 
geological disposal facility for radioactive wastes and indicates that floc 
communities within such a facility can survive at pHs up to 12.0.IMPORTANCE The 
role of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the survival of 
microorganisms in hyperalkaline conditions is poorly understood. Here, we 
present the taxonomy, morphology, and chemical characteristics of an EPS-based 
microbial floc, formed by a consortium isolated from an anthropogenic 
hyperalkaline site. Short-term (<2 weeks) survival of the flocs at a pH of 13 
was observed, with indefinite survival observed at a pH of 12.0. Measurements 
from micro-pH electrodes (10-μm-diameter tip) demonstrated that flocs maintain 
lower internal pHs in response to hyperalkaline conditions (pH 11.0, 11.5, and 
12.0), demonstrating that floc formation and EPS production are survival 
strategies under hyperalkaline conditions. The results indicate how microbial 
communities may survive and propagate within the hyperalkaline environment that 
is expected to prevail in a cementitious geological disposal facility for 
radioactive wastes; the results are also relevant to the wider extremophile 
community.

Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are tubular carbon structures that are 
able to enter cells through holes in the plasma membrane and produce changes in 
gene expression. In this work, we compared the functionality of carbon nanotubes 
with the electroporation that perforates membranes, in Brassica oleracea var. 
Italica (broccoli) root protoplasts. For this, we combined those treatments with 
control conditions and abiotic stress (salinity) in order to elucidate if the 
response is related to conditions optimal for the plant. The measurement of the 
osmotic water permeability (Pf), mineral concentrations and expression levels of 
aquaporins (PIP1s and PIP2s) revealed that the physiological action of the 
nanotubes was similar to that achieved with electroporation for both Pf and the 
concentrations of nutrients in the protoplasts. On the other hand, PIP1s and 
PIP2s expression was increased in the protoplasts receiving the control plus 
MWCNTs treatment but not in those treated with electroporation. This opens new 
and interesting lines, as it shows that nanotubes are able to modulate the 
expression of aquaporins.

5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) overexpression, attempting 
to provide excess EPSPS to combine with glyphosate, is one way to improve 
glyphosate resistance of plants. The EPSPS in extremophiles which is selected by 
nature to withstand the evolutionary pressure may possess some 
potential-specific biological functions. In this study, we reported the cloning, 
expression and enzymatic characterization of a novel Class II EPSPS AroAT. 
maritima from Thermotoga maritima MSB8. The enzyme showed low sequence 
identities with other EPSPSs, and was one of the most thermostable EPSPSs so 
far, which showed the optimum enzyme activity at 80 °C. The enzyme maintains the 
activity below 50 °C and in a wide range of pH 4.0-10, which indicated its 
stability under rough environment, especially in tropical regions and alkaline 
soil. Excellent Ki/Km value of AroAT. maritima suggested that the enzyme showed 
powerful competitive binding capacity of PEP over glyphosate and high glyphosate 
tolerance. Furthermore, aroAT. maritima gene was transformed into Arabidopsis 
thaliana. The transgenic lines were resistant to 15 mM glyphosate, which proved 
the application value in the cultivation of glyphosate-tolerant plants.

Heme catalases remove hydrogen peroxide by catalyzing its dismutation into water 
and molecular oxygen, thereby protecting the cell from oxidative damage. The 
Atacama plateau in northern Argentina, located 4000 m above sea level, is a 
desert area characterized by extreme UV radiation, high salinity and a large 
temperature variation between day and night. Here, the heme catalase KatE1 from 
an Atacama Acinetobacter sp. isolate was cloned, expressed and purified, with 
the aim of investigating its extremophilic properties. Kinetic and stability 
assays indicate that KatE1 is maximally active at 50°C in alkaline media, with a 
nearly unchanged specific activity between 0°C and 40°C in the pH range 
5.5-11.0. In addition, its three-dimensional crystallographic structure was 
solved, revealing minimal structural differences compared with its mesophilic 
and thermophilic analogues, except for a conserved methionine residue on the 
distal heme side, which is proposed to comprise a molecular adaptation to 
oxidative damage.

We present the hypothesis that microorganisms can change the freezing/melting 
curve of cold salty solutions by protein expression, as it is known that 
proteins can affect the liquid-to-ice transition, an ability that could be of 
ecological advantage for organisms on Earth and on Mars. We tested our 
hypothesis by identifying a suitable candidate, the well-known psycrophile and 
halotolerant bacteria Rhodococcus sp. JG3, and analyzing its response in culture 
conditions that included specific hygroscopic salts relevant to Mars-that is, 
highly concentrated magnesium perchlorate solutions of 20 wt % and 50 wt % 
Mg(ClO4)2 at both end members of the eutectic concentration (44 wt %)-and 
subfreezing temperatures (263 K and 253 K). Using a combination of techniques of 
molecular microbiology and aqueous geochemistry, we evaluated the potential 
roles of proteins over- or underexpressed as important players in different 
mechanisms for the adaptability of life to cold environments. We recorded the 
changes observed by micro-differential scanning calorimetry. Unfortunately, 
Rhodococcus sp. JG3 did not show our hypothesized effect on the melting 
characteristics of cold Mg-perchlorate solutions. However, the question remains 
as to whether our novel hypothesis that halophilic/psychrophilic bacteria or 
archaea can alter the freezing/melting curve of salt solutions could be 
validated. The null result obtained after analyzing just one case lays the 
foundation to continue the search for proteins produced by microorganisms that 
thrive in very cold, high-saline solutions, which would involve testing 
different microorganisms with different salt components. The immediate 
implications for the habitability of Mars are discussed.

Inland athalassohaline solar salterns provide unique opportunity to study 
microbial successions along salinity gradients that resemble transition in 
natural hypersaline lakes. We analyzed for the first time 16S rRNA gene amplicon 
sequences of bacteria (V1-V2) and archaea (V4-V5) in saltern brines of India's 
largest inland hypersaline Sambhar Lake. Brines of the salterns (S1-S4) are 
alkaline (pH 9.5-10.5) with salinities of 130, 170, 280 and 350 gL-1 
respectively. 16S rRNA gene copy-number of archaea outnumbered that of bacteria 
in all salterns. Their diversity also increased along S1 through S4, while that 
of bacteria decreased. Brines of S3 and S4 were dominated by specialized extreme 
halophilic bacterial (Halanaerobiales, Rhodothermaceae) and archaeal 
(Halobacteriales, Haloferacales) members with recognized salt-in strategy for 
osmoadaptation. Microbial assemblages positively correlated to saltern pH, total 
salinity, and ionic composition. Archaea in S1 and S2 were unprecedentedly 
represented by poorly known as-yet uncultivated groups, Woesearchaeota 
(90.35-93.51%) and Nanohaloarchaeota that belong to the newly proposed 
nano-sized superphylum DPANN. In fact, these taxa were identified in archaeal 
datasets of other athalassohaline salterns after re-analysis using latest RDP 
database. Thus, microbial compositions in hypersaline lakes are complex and need 
revisit particularly for their archaeal diversity to understand their hitherto 
unknown ecological function in extreme environments.

This work investigates the effects of partial replacement of vitamin C (Vit C) 
with a purified exopolysaccharide (EPS-Ca6) produced by Lactobacillus sp. Ca6, 
on the antioxidant activities of cooked beef sausages during refrigerated 
storage. The physicochemical, techno-functional and viscosity properties of 
EPS-Ca6 were also studied. Functional properties of EPS-Ca6 were determined 
based on Water Holding Capacity (WHC), Oil Holding Capacity (OHC), 
emulsification activity, and foaming ability. EPS-Ca6 demonstrated excellent 
emulsifying and emulsion stabilizing properties. It was able to emulsify several 
food-grade oils and hydrophobic compounds, particularly corn oil and diesel with 
emulsification indexes of 90 and 100%, respectively at a concentration of 0.5%. 
The effect of EPS-Ca6 on oxidative processes in cooked beef sausages during 
storage up to 12days at 4°C was evaluated. The obtained results showed a high 
rate (p<0.05) of oxymyoglobin (OxyMb) and low lipid oxidation. Overall, our 
findings provided evidence that EPS-Ca6 could be used as a natural additive for 
maintaining storage stability of cooked beef sausages, and could replace 
synthetic polymer in several industrial applications.

Bacteriophages encode a wide variety of cell wall disrupting enzymes that aid 
the viral escape in the final stages of infection. These lytic enzymes have 
accumulated notable interest due to their potential as novel antibacterials for 
infection treatment caused by multiple-drug resistant bacteria. Here, the 
detailed functional and structural characterization of Thermus parvatiensis 
prophage peptidoglycan lytic amidase AmiP, a globular Amidase_3 type lytic 
enzyme adapted to high temperatures is presented. The sequence and structure 
comparison with homologous lytic amidases reveals the key adaptation traits that 
ensure the activity and stability of AmiP at high temperatures. The crystal 
structure determined at a resolution of 1.8 Å displays a compact α/β-fold with 
multiple secondary structure elements omitted or shortened compared with protein 
structures of similar proteins. The functional characterization of AmiP 
demonstrates high efficiency of catalytic activity and broad substrate 
specificity toward thermophilic and mesophilic bacteria strains containing 
Orn-type or DAP-type peptidoglycan. The here presented AmiP constitutes the most 
thermoactive and ultrathermostable Amidase_3 type lytic enzyme biochemically 
characterized with a temperature optimum at 85°C. The extraordinary high melting 
temperature Tm 102.6°C confirms fold stability up to approximately 100°C. 
Furthermore, AmiP is shown to be more active over the alkaline pH range with pH 
optimum at pH 8.5 and tolerates NaCl up to 300 mM with the activity optimum at 
25 mM NaCl. This set of beneficial characteristics suggests that AmiP can be 
further exploited in biotechnology.

Anthropogenic activities have been increasing Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons 
(PAHs) release, promoting an urgent need for decontamination methods. Therefore, 
anthracene biodegradation by endophytic, extremophilic, and entomophilic fungi 
was studied. Moreover, a salting-out extraction methodology with the renewable 
solvent ethanol and the innocuous salt K2HPO4 was employed. Nine of the ten 
employed strains biodegraded anthracene in liquid medium (19-56% biodegradation) 
after 14 days at 30 °C, 130 rpm, and 100 mg L-1. The most efficient strain 
Didymellaceae sp. LaBioMMi 155, an entomophilic strain, was employed for 
optimized biodegradation, aiming at a better understanding of how factors like 
pollutant initial concentration, pH, and temperature affected this process. 
Biodegradation reached 90 ± 11% at 22 °C, pH 9.0, and 50 mg L-1. Futhermore, 8 
different PAHs were biodegraded and metabolites were identified. Then, 
experiments with anthracene in soil ex situ were performed and bioaugmentation 
with Didymellaceae sp. LaBioMMi 155 presented better results than natural 
attenuation by the native microbiome and biostimulation by the addition of 
liquid nutrient medium into soil. Therefore, an expanded knowledge about PAHs 
biodegradation processes was achieved with emphasis to the action of 
Didymellaceae sp. LaBioMMi 155, which can be further employed for in situ 
biodegradation (after strain security test), or for enzyme identification and 
isolation aiming at oxygenases with optimal activity under alkaline conditions.

Stromatolites are organo-sedimentary structures found principally in seas and 
saline lakes that contain sheets of sediments and minerals formed by layers of 
microbial communities, which trap sediments and induce the precipitation of 
minerals.A living stromatolite from the alkaline Laguna Interna in the Salar de 
Atacama was collected and one of the fragments was deposited in an experimental 
aquarium for 18 months. We used Illumina sequencing of PCR-amplified V4 regions 
of 16S rRNA genes from total extracted DNA to identify the microbial 
populations. The chemical structure was studied using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) 
and bench chemical methods. We found that members belonging to the 
Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi and Bacteroidetes phyla dominated 
the bacterial communities of the living and aquarium cultured samples. The 
potential metabolic functionality of the prokaryotic community reveals that 
sulfur, nitrogen, methane and carbon fixation metabolism functions are present 
in the samples. This study is the first to provide new insights into the 
prokaryotic community composition from this unusual aquatic desert site. Further 
studies will be helpful to obtain a better understanding of the biotic and 
abiotic mechanisms residing in stromatolites from Laguna Interna, as well as to 
have better knowledge about the formation of these biosignatures.

A psychrophilic extracellular protease was isolated from the marine bacterium 
Planococcus sp. M7 found in the deep-sea mud of the Southern Indian Ocean. The 
mature protease is about 43 kDa and contains 389 amino acids. Sequence alignment 
revealed that the protease whose catalytic triad was comprised of Ser224, 
Lys249, and Gln253 contains a catalytic module belonging to the serralysin-type 
protease family 41, and displays 46.55% identity with the experimentally 
verified serine protease from Bacillus subtilis str. 168. The enzyme displayed 
an alkaline mesophilic preference with an optimum pH of 10.0 and an optimum 
temperature of 35 °C. The enzyme retained its activity from 5 to 35 °C and was 
resistant to repeated freezing and thawing, but was completely inactivated at 
55 °C. Calcium ions had a protective effect against thermal denaturation. More 
than 60% of the maximum activity was retained at pH values in the range of 
5.0-11.0. Almost no activity loss was detected after 1 h of incubation at pH 
8.0-10.0 and 20 °C, or with 1.0% SDS. Most important, this protease also showed 
good stability and compatibility with the standard enzyme-free detergent, which 
indicates its special interest for applications in detergent industry.

(7R,8S)-diaminopelargonic acid transaminase from the cold-adapted Gram-negative 
bacterium Psychrobacter cryohalolentis (Pcryo361) is able to react with 
unnatural substrates including (S)-( +)-1-phenylethylamine, aldehydes and 
α-diketones. Additionally, Pcryo361 is active at 0-50 °C and retains up to 10% 
of the maximum activity at 0 °C. Here, we report a detailed study on the 
stability and low temperature activity of Pcryo361. At the optimal pH for 
(S)-amine activity (pH 10.0), the enzyme was stable at 0-10 °C and no decrease 
in the enzyme activity was observed within 24 h in a slightly alkaline medium, 
pH 8.0, at 35 °C. Pcryo361 was solvent stable and was activated in 10% DMSO and 
DMFA at 35 °C. An analysis of the efficiency of catalysis of Pcryo361 at 35 °C 
and 10 °C showed that the specificity towards (S)-( +)-1-phenylethylamine 
dropped at 10 °C; however, the specificity towards 2,3-butanedione remained 
unchanged. Inhibition analysis showed that Pcryo361 activity was not inhibited 
by acetophenone but inhibited by amines (products of aldehyde amination). The 
observed pH stability and low temperature activity of Pcryo361 with activated 
keto substrates are attractive features in the field of development of 
stereoselective amination at low temperatures.

The snow-covered surfaces of Antarctica comprise an extreme environment that 
favors the development of life forms with adaptations to adverse low-temperature 
habitats. The ability to survive and such temperatures might involve the 
production of antifreeze proteins and ice-binding proteins that attenuate the 
effects of intense cold temperatures. He, we sequenced and reconstructed the 
nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of the endemic Antarctic fungus Antarctomyces 
pellizariae UFMGCB 12416. We then have identified a putative ice-binding 
protein-coding gene, mapped the presence of secondary metabolite gene clusters, 
and reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of a A. pellizariae with others 
Leotiomycetes from the alignment of hundreds of orthologous single-copy 
proteins. Our results will deepen the understanding of microbial ice-binding 
proteins and the genomic aspects of psychrophilic fungi. DATASET: The 
GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number for the gene sequence of ice-binding protein 
from A. pellizariae determined in this study is MN867686. The Whole Genome 
Shotgun project of strain A. pellizariae UFMGCB 12416 has been deposited at

Eutrema salsugineum is considered as extremophile model species. To gain 
insights into the root hydraulic conductivity and the role played by aquaporins 
in E. salsugineum, we investigated the aquaporin family profiles, plant water 
status and root hydraulic conductivity under standard (salt-free) and salt 
stress conditions. We found that there was no variation in the relative electric 
conductivity of the leaves when the salt concentration was less than 200 mM 
NaCl, and the transpiration rate dropped to 60.6% at 100 mM NaCl for 14 days 
compared to that at standard conditions. The pressure chamber techniques 
indicated that the root hydraulic conductivity of E. salsugineum was repressed 
by salt stress. However, propionic acid, usually used as an aquaporin inhibitor, 
unexpectedly enhanced the root hydraulic conductivity of E. salsugineum. The 
aquaporin family in E. salsugineum was profiled and the PIP aquaporin expression 
was investigated at the transcriptional and translational levels. Finally, two 
EsPIPs were identified to play a role in salt stress. The overall study provides 
evidence on how halophytes maintain their water status and aquaporin regulation 
pattern under salt stress conditions.

A novel alkaline mannanase Man26A has been found in the culture of an 
alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain JAMB-750 and the optimal pH for the mannanase 
activity of the enzyme was around pH 10 (J Biol Macromol 4: 67-74, 2004). This 
optimal pH is the highest among those of the mannanases reported to date. The 
gene man26A coding the enzyme was cloned from the genomic DNA of strain JAMB-750 
and sequenced. It encodes a protein of 997 amino acids including a signal 
peptide. The N-terminal half (Glu27-Val486) of the enzyme exhibited moderate 
similarities to other mannanases belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 26, 
such as the enzymes from Cellvibrio japonicus (37% identity), Cellulomonas fimi 
(33% identity), and Bacillus sp. strain AM-001 (28% identity). The C-terminal 
half was found to contain four domains. The first, second, third, and fourth 
domains exhibited similarities to the carbohydrate-binding module, the 
mannan-binding module, the Homo sapiens collagen type IX alpha I chain, and the 
membrane anchor region of Gram-positive surface proteins, respectively. Its 
recombinant mannanase was produced extracellularly using Bacillus subtilis as 
the host. The optimal pH for the mannanase activity of the recombinant enzyme 
was around pH 10. The enzyme was very resistant to surfactants, for example, SDS 
up to 2.0% (w/v).

BACKGROUND: Wadi El Natrun microorganisms have been considered as a new resource 
for natural products due to its extreme condition of salinity and alkalinity. 
Therefore, this study was devoted to generate metagemic library from soils 
collected from such an extreme environment in order to clone a novel cellulase 
for physique industrial applications.
RESULTS: Total soil-DNA was successfully extracted, and then digested by 
different restriction enzymes. Purified fragments ranged ~ 200-6500 bp were 
ligated and were cloned into plasmid cloning vector (pUC19) by using Escherichia 
coli DH5α (E. coli) host cells. A constructed metagenomic library composed of 
270 clones was screened on carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) agar plate where the 
active clones had been characterized by the formation of the yellowish halo 
zone. Thereafter, clone 1 was selected as the most active as being based on 
cellulase activity quantification (19 μ/ml). Plasmid related to clone 1 encoded 
cellSNSY gene of approximately 1.5 kb was subjected to molecular 
characterization; the obtained partial sequence of 861 bps encoded 287 amino 
acids showing 76% similarity to the endoglucanase gene of Bacillus 
amyloliquefaciens. The recombinant cellSNSY was expressed under lacz promoter at 
1 mM of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), giving 21 μ/ml cellulase 
after ~ 27 h. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
(SDS-PAGE) and an activity staining of the recombinant cellSNSY which revealed 
an active band with a molecular mass ~ 59 kDa appeared in the induced sample. 
The maximum enzyme activity of crude cellSNSY was observed at 45 °C and for a pH 
of 8.5. Interestingly, the enzyme activity was slightly inhibited by 
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and methanol. It showed high resistance 
to the tested heavy metals and the surfactant which ordered Zn> (SDS,Fe)>Mn>Cu.
CONCLUSIONS: This study established an easy and a skillful way to clone/express 
a new found cellulase gene(s) under lacZ promoter. The isolated recombinant 
cellSNSY showed 76% similarity to endoglucanase gene, and the enzyme showed 
tolerance to the mostly tested agents including heavy metals, surfactant, 
solvents, and EDTA. Additionally, the studied recombinant showed a high 
stability up to 55 °C and for alkaline pH 8.5. These features make it an ample 
and viable for many applications.

Heat shock protein 20 (Hsp20) is a major family of heat shock proteins that 
mainly function as molecular chaperones and are markedly accumulated in cells 
when organisms are subjected to environmental stress, particularly heat. 
Canavalia rosea is an extremophile halophyte with good adaptability to 
environmental high temperature and is widely distributed in coastal areas or 
islands in tropical and subtropical regions. In this study, we identified a 
total of 41 CrHsp20 genes in the C. rosea genome. The gene structures, 
phylogenetic relationships, chromosome locations, and conserved motifs of each 
CrHsp20 or encoding protein were analyzed. The promoters of CrHsp20s contained a 
series of predicted cis-acting elements, which indicates that the expression of 
different CrHsp20 members is regulated precisely. The expression patterns of the 
CrHsp20 family were analyzed by RNA sequencing both at the tissue-specific level 
and under different abiotic stresses, and were further validated by quantitative 
reverse transcription PCR. The integrated expression profiles of the CrHsp20s 
indicated that most CrHsp20 genes were greatly upregulated (up to dozens to 
thousands of times) after 2 h of heat stress. However, some of the 
heat-upregulated CrHsp20 genes showed completely different expression patterns 
in response to salt, alkaline, or high osmotic stresses, which indicates their 
potential specific function in mediating the response of C. rosea to abiotic 
stresses. In addition, some of CrHsp20s were cloned and functionally 
characterized for their roles in abiotic stress tolerance in yeast. Taken 
together, these findings provide a foundation for functionally characterizing 
Hsp20s to unravel their possible roles in the adaptation of this species to 
tropical coral reefs. Our results also contribute to the understanding of the 
complexity of the response of CrHsp20 genes to other abiotic stresses and may 
help in future studies evaluating the functional characteristics of CrHsp20s for 
crop genetic improvement.

Hydrocarbonoclastic biofilms were established on sterile glass plates vertically 
submerged for 1 month in a hypersaline soil/water suspension containing 0.3% 
crude oil. The culture-dependent analysis of the microbial community in those 
biofilms revealed hydrocarbonoclastic species in the magnitude of 10(3) cells 
cm(-2). Those species belonged to the halophilic bacterial genera Marinobacter, 
Halomonas, Dietzia, Bacillus, Arhodomonas, Aeromonas and Kocuria as well as to 
the haloarchaeal genera Haloferax and Halobacterium. Those organisms were not 
evenly distributed over the biofilm surface area. The culture-independent 
analysis revealed a different community composition, which was based on four 
uncultured and four cultured taxa. Depending on the culture conditions and the 
sort of chemical amendments, the biofilms succeeded in removing in 2 weeks up to 
about 60-70% of crude oil, pure n-hexadecane and pure phenanthrene in 
hypersaline pond water samples. The amendment with KCl, MgSO4 and a vitamin 
mixture composed of thiamin, pyridoxine, vitamin B12, biotin, riboflavin and 
folic acid was most effective.

Haloalkaliphilic microorganisms are double extremophiles functioning optimally 
at high salinity and pH. Their typical habitats are soda lakes, geologically 
ancient yet widespread ecosystems supposed to harbor relict microbial 
communities. We compared metabolic features and their determinants in two 
strains of the natronophilic species Dethiobacter alkaliphilus, the only 
cultured representative of the class ""Dethiobacteria"" (Bacillota). The strains 
of D. alkaliphilus were previously isolated from geographically remote Mongolian 
and Kenyan soda lakes. The type strain AHT1T was described as a facultative 
chemolithoautotrophic sulfidogen reducing or disproportionating sulfur or 
thiosulfate, while strain Z-1002 was isolated as a chemolithoautotrophic iron 
reducer. Here, we uncovered the iron reducing ability of strain AHT1T and the 
ability of strain Z-1002 for thiosulfate reduction and anaerobic Fe(II) 
oxidation. Key catabolic processes sustaining the growth of both D. alkaliphilus 
strains appeared to fit the geochemical settings of two contrasting natural 
alkaline environments, sulfur-enriched soda lakes and iron-enriched 
serpentinites. This hypothesis was supported by a meta-analysis of 
Dethiobacterial genomes and by the enrichment of a novel phylotype from a 
subsurface alkaline aquifer under Fe(III)-reducing conditions. Genome analysis 
revealed multiheme c-type cytochromes to be the most probable determinants of 
iron and sulfur redox transformations in D. alkaliphilus. Phylogeny 
reconstruction showed that all the respiratory processes in this organism are 
likely provided by evolutionarily related early forms of unconventional octaheme 
tetrathionate and sulfite reductases and their structural analogs, OmhA/OcwA 
Fe(III)-reductases. Several phylogenetically related determinants of anaerobic 
Fe(II) oxidation were identified in the Z-1002 genome, and the oxidation process 
was experimentally demonstrated. Proteomic profiling revealed two distinct sets 
of multiheme cytochromes upregulated in iron(III)- or thiosulfate-respiring 
cells and the cytochromes peculiar for Fe(II) oxidizing cells. We suggest that 
maintaining high variation in multiheme cytochromes is an effective adaptive 
strategy to occupy geochemically contrasting alkaline environments. We propose 
that sulfur-enriched soda lakes could be secondary habitats for D. alkaliphilus 
compared to Fe-rich serpentinites, and that the ongoing evolution of 
Dethiobacterales could retrace the evolutionary path that may have occurred in 
prokaryotes at a turning point in the biosphere's history, when the 
intensification of the sulfur cycle outweighed the global significance of the 
iron cycle.

The soil of the former lake Texcoco is an extreme environment localized in the 
valley of Mexico City, Mexico. It is highly saline and alkaline, where Na+, 
Cl(-), HCO3(-) and CO3(2-) are the predominant ions, with a pH ranging from 9.8 
to 11.7 and electrolytic conductivities in saturation extracts from 22 to 150 dS 
m(-1). Metagenomic DNA from the archaeal community was extracted directly from 
soil and used as template to amplify 16S ribosomal gene by PCR. PCR products 
were used to construct gene libraries. The ribosomal library showed that the 
archaeal diversity included Natronococcus sp., Natronolimnobius sp., 
Natronobacterium sp., Natrinema sp., Natronomonas sp., Halovivax sp., 
""Halalkalicoccus jeotgali"" and novel clades within the family of 
Halobacteriaceae. Four clones could not be classified. It was found that the 
archaeal diversity in an alkaline-saline soil of the former lake Texcoco, 
Mexico, was low, but showed yet uncharacterized and unclassified species.

An extracellular protease was purified from a deep-sea psychrophilic bacterium 
strain DY-A which was identified as a Pseudomonas species. The optimal growth 
and protease-producing temperatures of the strain were all 10 degrees C, and the 
protease was secreted only at temperatures under 20 degrees C. The enzyme was 
most active at 40 degrees C and at pH 10.0. It was inhibited by phenylmethyl 
sulfonylfluoride and diisopropyl fluorophosphate, indicating that it is a serine 
protease. Chelators such as EDTA, EGTA, 1,10-phenanthroline and 2,2'-bipyridyl 
produced a decrease of activity. The enzyme was sensitive to denaturing agents 
such as SDS, urea, and guanidine HCl and resistant to thiol-containing reducing 
agents such as dithiotreitol. The enzyme was active towards 
N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe- p-nitroanilide and N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu- 
p-nitroanilide. The native molecular mass of the enzyme determined by native 
PAGE and SDS-PAGE was 25 kDa.

Ice-binding proteins (IBPs) from extremophile organisms can modulate ice 
formation and growth. There are many (bio)technological applications of IBPs, 
from cryopreservation to mitigating freeze-thaw damage in concrete to frozen 
food texture modifiers. Extraction or expression of IBPs can be challenging to 
scale up, and hence polymeric biomimetics have emerged. It is, however, 
desirable to use biosourced monomers and heteroatom-containing backbones in 
polymers for in vivo or environmental applications to allow degradation. Here we 
investigate high molecular weight polyproline as an ice recrystallization 
inhibitor (IRI). Low molecular weight polyproline is known to be a weak IRI. Its 
activity is hypothesized to be due to the unique PPI helix it adopts, but it has 
not been thoroughly investigated. Here an open-to-air aqueous N-carboxyanhydride 
polymerization is employed to obtain polyproline with molecular weights of up to 
50000 g mol-1. These polymers were found to have IRI activity down to 5 mg mL-1, 
unlike a control peptide of polysarcosine, which did not inhibit all ice growth 
at up to 40 mg mL-1. The polyprolines exhibited lower critical solution 
temperature behavior and assembly/aggregation observed at room temperature, 
which may contribute to its activity. Single ice crystal assays with polyproline 
led to faceting, consistent with specific ice-face binding. This work shows that 
non-vinyl-based polymers can be designed to inhibit ice recrystallization and 
may offer a more sustainable or environmentally acceptable, while synthetically 
scalable, route to large-scale applications.

The lacustrine systems of La Brava and La Punta, located in the Tilopozo sector 
in the extreme south of Salar de Atacama, are pristine high-altitude Andean 
lakes found along the central Andes of South America. This shallow ecosystem 
suffers from permanent evaporation, leading to falling water levels, causing it 
to recede or disappear during the dry season. This dynamic causes 
physicochemical changes in lakes, such as low nutrient availability, pH change, 
and dissolved metals, which can influence the composition of the microbial 
community. In this study, we used a metataxonomic approach (16S rRNA 
hypervariable regions V3 to V4) to characterize the sedimentary microbiota of 
these lakes. To understand how the water column affects and is structured in the 
microbiota of these lakes, we combined the analysis of the persistence of the 
water column through satellite images and physicochemical characterization. Our 
results show a significant difference in abiotic factors and microbiota 
composition between La Punta and La Brava lakes. In addition, microbiota 
analysis revealed compositional changes in the ecological disaggregation (main 
and isolated bodies) and antagonistic changes in the abundance of certain taxa 
between lakes. These findings are an invaluable resource for understanding the 
microbiological diversity of high Andean lakes using a multidisciplinary 
approach that evaluates the microbiota behavior in response to abiotic factors. 
IMPORTANCE In this study, we analyzed the persistence of the water column 
through satellite images and physicochemical characterization to investigate the 
composition and diversity in High Andean Lake Systems in a hyperarid 
environment. In addition to the persistence of the water column, this approach 
can be used to analyze changes in the morphology of saline accumulations and 
persistence of snow or ice; for example, for establishing variable plant cover 
over time and evaluating the microbiota associated with soils with seasonal 
changes in plants. This makes it an ideal approach to search for novel 
extremophilic microorganisms with unique properties. In our case, it was used to 
study microorganisms capable of resisting desiccation and water restriction for 
a considerable period and adapting to survive in ecological niches, such as 
those with high UV irradiation, extreme drought, and high salt concentration.

Ecological diversification through divergent selection is thought to be a major 
force during the process of adaptive radiations. However, the large sizes and 
complexity of most radiations such as those of the cichlids in the African Great 
Lakes make it impossible to infer the exact evolutionary history of any 
population divergence event. The genus Alcolapia, a small cichlid lineage 
endemic to Lakes Magadi and Natron in East Africa, exhibits phenotypes similar 
to some of those found in cichlids of the radiations of the African Great Lakes. 
The simplicity within Alcolapia makes it an excellent model system to 
investigate ecological diversification and speciation. We used an integrated 
approach including population genomics based on RAD-seq data, geometric 
morphometrics and stable isotope analyses to investigate the eco-morphological 
diversification of tilapia in Lake Magadi and its satellite lake Little Magadi. 
Additionally, we reconstructed the demographic history of the species using 
coalescent simulations based on the joint site frequency spectrum. The 
population in Little Magadi has a characteristically upturned mouth--possibly an 
adaptation to feeding on prey from the water surface. Eco-morphological 
differences between populations within Lake Magadi are more subtle, but are 
consistent with known ecological differences between its lagoons such as high 
concentrations of nitrogen attributable to extensive guano deposits in Rest of 
Magadi relative to Fish Springs Lagoon. All populations diverged simultaneously 
only about 1100 generations ago. Differences in levels of gene flow between 
populations and the effective population sizes have likely resulted in the 
inferred heterogeneous patterns of genome-wide differentiation.

Two alkaliphilic strains, designated FJAT-45086T and FJAT-45122T, were isolated 
from alkali soli in Nima County, Tibet, China. Both strains were Gram-positive, 
rod-shaped and shared low 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with the members of 
the genus Bacillus. They contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the cell-wall 
diamino acid and MK-7 as the menaquinone. The major fatty acids (>5%) of strain 
FJAT-45086T were anteiso-C15:0, C16:0, iso-C15:0, C16:1ω11c and anteiso-C17:0, 
whereas strain FJAT-45122T consisted of iso-C15:0, anteiso-C15:0, iso-C17:1ω10c, 
iso-C17:0, anteiso-C17:0, C16:0 and C16:1ω11c. The genome G + C content of 
strains FJAT-45086T and FJAT-45122T was 37.8 and 38.2 mol%, respectively. The 
polar lipids of strain FJAT-45086T were diphosphatidyl glycerol (DPG), 
phosphatidyl glycerol (PG), phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidyl 
choline (PC), whereas strain FJAT-45122T consisted of DPG, PG, phosphatidyl 
methyl ethanolamine (PME) and an unidentified aminophospholipids (UAPL). The 
average nucleotide identity values of strains FJAT-45086T and FJAT-45122T were 
below the cut-off level (95-96%) for species delineation. Based on the results, 
strains FJAT-45086T and FJAT-45122T represent two novel species of the genus 
Bacillus, for which the names Bacillus alkalisoli sp. nov., and Bacillus 
solitudinis sp. nov., are proposed. The type strain, FJAT-45122T (=DSM 
104631T = CCTCC AB 2016254T), FJAT-45086T (=DSM 104056T = CCTCC AB 2016232T).

DNA has been extracted on site from the brines of the final crystallizing pond 
of an alkaline saltern at Lake Magadi, Kenya. Amplification of 16S rRNA genes 
followed by cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis has revealed the 
presence of two distinct new archaeal lineages. The majority of cloned sequences 
showed greater than 95% identity to each other, but only 88%-90% similarity to 
any cultivated haloalkaliphilic Archaea, and form a distinct cluster within the 
known Haloarchaea. Two cloned genes showed close similarity to each other but 
only 76% similarity to any known archaeal sequence, and therefore represent a 
distinct phylotype only distantly related to the euryarchaeotal branch of the 
Archaea.

Flooding an extreme alkaline-saline soil decreased alkalinity and salinity, 
which will change the bacterial populations. Bacterial 16S rDNA libraries were 
generated of three soils with different electrolytic conductivity (EC), i.e. 
soil with EC 1.7 dS m(-1) and pH 7.80 (LOW soil), with EC 56 dS m(-1) and pH 
10.11 (MEDIUM soil) and with EC 159 dS m(-1) and pH 10.02 (HIGH soil), using 
universal bacterial oligonucleotide primers, and 463 clone 16S rDNA sequences 
were analyzed phylogenetically. Library proportions and clone identification of 
the phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Cyanobacteria, 
Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Cloroflexi showed that the bacterial communities 
were different. Species and genera of the Rhizobiales, Rhodobacterales and 
Xanthomonadales orders of the alpha- and gamma-subdivision of Proteobacteria 
were found at the three sites. Species and genera of the Rhodospirillales, 
Sphingobacteriales, Clostridiales, Oscillatoriales and Caldilineales were found 
only in the HIGH soil, Sphingomonadales, Burkholderiales and Pseudomonadales in 
the MEDIUM soil, Myxococcales in the LOW soil, and Actinomycetales in the MEDIUM 
and LOW soils. It was found that the largest diversity at the order and species 
level was found in the MEDIUM soil as bacteria of both the HIGH and LOW soils 
were found in it.

Mature landfill leachate is a heavily-polluted wastewater due to its 
recalcitrant nature of organic matter, and high ammonia and salt content. 
Despite the moderate saline and alkaline nature of this habitat, no attention 
has been paid to the isolation and functional role of extremophiles in such 
environment. In this work, a total of 73 and 29 bacterial strains were isolated 
by using alkaline and saline media, respectively, while bacteria from mature 
landfill leachate growing in these media were enumerated as 1.5 ± 0.1 (×108) and 
5.8 ± 0.9 (×108) cfu/L. Based on their pH and salt ranges and optima for growth, 
all bacterial isolates were halotolerant alkaliphiles (either facultative or 
obligate), with the majority of them being extremely halotolerant bacteria. 
These halotolerant alkaliphiles were classified into 14 operational taxonomic 
units (OTUs). Of these, 12 are placed within known halophilic and alkaliphilic 
species of the genera Dietzia, Glycocaulis, Halomonas, Marinobacter, 
Piscibacillus and Rhodobacter, while the remaining OTUs represented two novel 
phylogenetic linkages among the families Cyclobacteriaceae and Rhodobacteraceae. 
Examination of their hydrolytic ability through the performance of lipase, 
protease and β-glucosidase assays using landfill leachate as the growth 
substrate revealed that all halotolerant alkaliphiles isolated exhibited 
extremely high lipolytic activities (up to 78,800 U g-1 protein), indicating a 
key involvement of extremophilic microbiota at the late landfill maturation 
stage. The wide extremely lipolytic halotolerant alkaliphilic community 
identified also makes mature landfill leachate an ideal microbial pool for the 
isolation of novel extremophiles of biotechnological interest.

Extensive research has provided a wealth of data on prokaryotes in caves and 
their role in biogeochemical cycles. Ice caves in carbonate rocks, however, 
remain enigmatic environments with limited knowledge of their microbial 
taxonomic composition. In this study, bacterial and archaeal communities of the 
Obstans Ice Cave (Carnic Alps, Southern Austria) were analyzed by 
next-generation amplicon sequencing and by cultivation of bacterial strains at 
10 °C and studying their metabolism. The most abundant bacterial taxa were 
uncultured Burkholderiaceae and Brevundimonas spp. in the drip water, 
Flavobacterium, Alkanindiges and Polaromonas spp. in the ice, Pseudonocardia, 
Blastocatella spp., uncultured Pyrinomonadaceae and Sphingomonadaceae in 
carbonate precipitates, and uncultured Gemmatimonadaceae and Longimicrobiaceae 
in clastic cave sediments. These taxa are psychrotolerant/psychrophilic and 
chemoorganotrophic bacteria. On a medium with Mg2+/Ca2+ = 1 at 21 °C and 10 °C, 
65% and 35% of the cultivated strains precipitated carbonates, respectively. The 
first ~ 200 µm-size crystals appeared 2 and 6 weeks after the start of the 
cultivation experiments at 21 °C and 10 °C, respectively. The crystal structure 
of these microbially induced carbonate precipitates and their Mg-content are 
strongly influenced by the Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio of the culture medium. These results 
suggest that the high diversity of prokaryotic communities detected in cryogenic 
subsurface environments actively contributes to carbonate precipitation, despite 
living at the physical limit of the presence of liquid water.

Alkaline hydrotherms of the Baikal rift zone are unique systems to study the 
diversity of thermophilic bacteria. In this study, we present data on the 
phototrophic bacterial community of cyanobacterial mats from the alkaline Alla 
hot spring. Using a clonal analysis approach, this study evaluated the species 
diversity, the proportion of oxygenic and anoxygenic phototrophs and their 
distribution between various areas of the spring. Novel group-specific PCR 
primers were designed and applied to detect representatives of the Chloroflexus 
and Roseiflexus genera in mat samples. For the first time, the presence of 
Roseiflexus-like bacteria was detected in the Baikal rift zone.

A new chemolithoautotrophic, facultatively alkaliphilic, extremely 
salt-tolerant, sulfur-oxidizing bacterium was isolated from an alkaline 
hypersaline lake in the Altai Steppe (Siberia, Russia). According to 16S rDNA 
analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization, strain HL 17T was identified as a new 
species of the genus Thialkalivibrio belonging to the gamma subdivision of the 
Proteobacteria for which the name Thialkalivibrio halophilus is proposed. Strain 
HL 17T is an extremely salt-tolerant bacterium growing at sodium concentrations 
between 0.2 and 5 M, with an optimum of 2 M Na+. It grew at high concentrations 
of NaCl and of Na2CO3/NaHCO3 (soda). Strain HL 17T is a facultative alkaliphile 
growing at pH range 7.5-9.8, with a broad optimum between pH 8.0 and 9.0. It 
used reduced inorganic sulfur compounds (thiosulfate, sulfide, polysulfide, 
elemental sulfur, and tetrathionate) as energy sources and electron donors. In 
continuous culture under energy limitation, thiosulfate was stoichiometrically 
oxidized to sulfate. In sodium carbonate medium under alkaline conditions, the 
maximum growth rate was similar, while the biomass yield was lower as compared 
with the NaCl-grown culture. The maximum sulfur-oxidizing capacity measured in 
washed cells was higher in the soda buffer independent of the growth conditions. 
The compatible solute content of the biomass was higher in the sodium 
chloride-grown culture than in the sodium carbonate/bicarbonate-grown culture. 
The data suggest that the osmotic pressure differences between soda and NaCl 
solutions might be responsible for the difference observed in compatible solutes 
production. This may have important implications in overall energetic metabolism 
of high salt adaptation.

Proteases are the most important group of industrial enzymes and they can be 
used in several fields including biorefineries for the valorization of 
industrial byproducts. In this study, we purified and characterized novel 
extremophilic proteases produced by a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain isolated 
from Mauritia flexuosa palm swamps soil samples in Peruvian Amazon. In addition, 
we tested their ability to hydrolyze distillers dried grains with solubles 
(DDGS) protein. Three alkaline and thermophilic serine proteases named EI, EII, 
and EIII with molecular weight of 35, 40, and 55 kDa, respectively, were 
purified. EI and EIII were strongly inhibited by EDTA and Pefabloc being 
classified as serine-metalloproteases, while EII was completely inhibited only 
by Pefabloc being classified as a serine protease. In addition, EI and EII 
exhibited highest enzymatic activity at pH 8, while EIII at pH 11 maintaining 
almost 100% of it at pH 12. All the enzymes demonstrated optimum activity at 
60°C. Enzymatic activity of EI was strongly stimulated in presence of Mn2+ 
(6.9-fold), EII was stimulated by Mn2+ (3.7-fold), while EIII was slightly 
stimulated by Zn2+ , Ca2+ , and Mg2+ . DDGS protein hydrolysis using purified 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa M211 proteases demonstrated that, based on glycine 
released, EIII presented the highest proteolytic activity toward DDGS. This 
enzyme enabled the release 63% of the total glycine content in wheat DDGS 
protein, 2.2-fold higher that when using the commercial Pronase®. Overall, our 
results indicate that this novel extremopreoteases have a great potential to be 
applied in DDGS hydrolysis. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

Soda pans of the Pannonian steppe are unique environments regarding their 
physical and chemical characteristics: shallowness, high turbidity, intermittent 
character, alkaline pH, polyhumic organic carbon concentration, hypertrophic 
condition, moderately high salinity, sodium and carbonate ion dominance. The 
pans are highly productive environments with picophytoplankton predominance. 
Little is known about the planktonic bacterial communities inhabiting these 
aquatic habitats; therefore, amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics were 
applied to reveal their composition and functional properties. Results showed a 
taxonomically complex bacterial community which was distinct from other soda 
lakes regarding its composition, e.g. the dominance of class Alphaproteobacteria 
was observed within phylum Proteobacteria. The shotgun metagenomic analysis 
revealed several functional gene components related to the harsh and at the same 
time hypertrophic environmental conditions, e.g. proteins involved in stress 
response, transport and hydrolase systems targeting phytoplankton-derived 
organic matter. This is the first detailed report on the indigenous planktonic 
bacterial communities coping with the multiple extreme conditions present in the 
unique soda pans of the Pannonian steppe.

The gene for a highly alkaline pectate lyase, Pel-4A, from alkaliphilic Bacillus 
sp. strain P-4-N was cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed in Bacillus subtilis 
cells. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme (318 amino acids, 
34805 Da) showed moderate homology to those of known pectate lyases in the 
polysaccharide lyase family 1. The purified recombinant enzyme had an 
isoelectric point of pH 9.7 and a molecular mass of 34 kDa, and exhibited a very 
high specific activity compared with known pectate lyases reported so far. The 
enzyme activity was stimulated 1.6 fold by addition of NaCl at an optimum of 100 
mM. When Pel-4A was stored at 50 degrees C for 60 h, striking stabilization by 
100 mM NaCl was observed in a pH range from 5 to 11.5, whereas it was stable 
only around pH 11 in the absence of NaCl.

Novel alkaliphilic, mesophilic bacteria were isolated from subseafloor alkaline 
serpentine mud from the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Hole 1200D at a serpentine 
mud volcano, South Chamorro Seamount in the Mariana Forearc. The cells of type 
strain ODP1200D-1.5T were motile rods with a single polar flagellum. Growth was 
observed between 10 and 45-50 degrees C (optimum temperature: 30-35 degrees C, 
45-min doubling time), between pH 6.5 and 10.8-11.4 (optimum: pH 8.5-9.0), and 
between NaCl concentrations of 0 and 21% (w/v) (optimum NaCl concentration: 
2.5-3.5%). The isolate was a facultatively anaerobic heterotroph utilizing 
various complex substrates, hydrocarbons, carbohydrates, organic acids, and 
amino acids. Nitrate or fumarate could serve as an electron acceptor to support 
growth under anaerobic conditions. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 57.5 
mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the 
isolate belonged to the genus Marinobacter and was the most closely related to 
M. aquaeolei strain VT8T and M. hydrocarbonoclasticus strain SP.17T, while 
DNA-DNA hybridization demonstrated that the new isolate could be genetically 
differentiated from the previously described species of Marinobacter. Based on 
the physiological and molecular properties of the new isolate, we propose the 
name Marinobacter alkaliphilus sp. nov., type strain: ODP1200D-1.5T (JCM12291T 
and ATCC BAA-889T).

Heat-lability is a key roadblock that strangles the widespread applications of 
many biological products. In nature, archaeal and extremophilic organisms 
utilize amorphous silica as a protective biomineral and exhibit considerable 
thermal tolerance. Here we present a bioinspired approach to generate 
thermostable virus by introducing an artificial hydrated silica exterior on 
individual virion. Similar to thermophiles, silicified viruses can survive 
longer at high temperature than their wild-type relatives. Virus inactivation 
assays showed that silica hydration exterior of the modified virus effectively 
prolonged infectivity of viruses by ∼ 10-fold at room temperature, achieving a 
similar result as that obtained by storing native ones at 4 °C. Mechanistic 
studies indicate that amorphous silica nanoclusters stabilize the inner virion 
structure by forming a layer that restricts molecular mobility, acting as 
physiochemical nanoanchors. Notably, we further evaluate the potential 
application of this biomimetic strategy in stabilizing clinically approved 
vaccine, and the silicified polio vaccine that can retain 90% potency after the 
storage at room temperature for 35 days was generated by this biosilicification 
approach and validated with in vivo experiments. This approach not only 
biomimetically connects inorganic material and living virus but also provides an 
innovative resolution to improve the thermal stability of biological agents 
using nanomaterials.

Biodecolorization and biodegradation of azo dyes are a challenge due to their 
recalcitrance and the characteristics of textile effluents. This study presents 
the use of Halomonas sp. in the decolorization of azo dyes Reactive Black 5 
(RB5), Remazol Brilliant Violet 5R (RV5), and Reactive Orange 16 (RO16) under 
high alkalinity and salinity conditions. Firstly, the effect of air supply, pH, 
salinity and dye concentration was evaluated. Halomonas sp. was able to remove 
above 84% of all dyes in a wide range of pH (6-11) and salt concentrations 
(2-10%). The decolorization efficiency of RB5, RV5, and RO16 was found to 
be ≥ 90% after 24, 13 and 3 h, respectively, at 50 mg L-1 of dyes. The process 
was monitored by HPLC-DAD, finding a reduction of dyes along the time. Further, 
Halomonas sp. was immobilized in volcanic rocks and used in a packed bed reactor 
for 72 days, achieving a removal rate of 3.48, 5.73, and 8.52 mg L-1 h-1, for 
RB5, RV5 and RO16, respectively, at 11.8 h. The study has confirmed the 
potential of Halomonas sp. to decolorize azo dyes under high salinity and 
alkalinity conditions and opened a scope for future research in the treatment of 
textile effluents.

The diversity of the dissimilatory and respiratory nitrate-reducing communities 
was studied in two soils of the former lake Texcoco (Mexico). Genes encoding the 
membrane-bound nitrate reductase (narG) and the periplasmic nitrate reductase 
(napA) were used as functional markers. To investigate bacterial communities 
containing napA and narG in saline alkaline soils of the former lake Texcoco, 
libraries of the two sites were constructed (soil T3 with pH 11 and electrolytic 
conductivity in saturated extract (EC(SE)) 160 dS m(-1) and soil T1 with pH 8.5 
and EC(SE) 0.8 dS m(-1)). Phylogenetic analysis of napA sequences separated the 
clone families into two main groups: dependent or independent of NapB. Most of 
napA sequences from site T1 were grouped in the NapB-dependent clade, meanwhile 
most of the napA sequences from the extreme soil T3 were affiliated to the 
NapB-independent group. For both sites, partial narG sequences were associated 
with representatives of the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria phyla, 
but the proportions of the clones were different. Our results support the 
concept of a specific and complex nitrate-reducing community for each soil of 
the former lake Texcoco.

In this study, Streptococcus macedonicus (S. macedonicus) strains were 
identified from Algerian traditional fermented milks (Lben and Rayeb). Important 
prerequisites of probiotic interest such as acidity, bile salts tolerance, and 
adhesion ability to epithelial cells were investigated. A combination of 
phenotypic (ability to grow on Bile Esculin Azide medium, BEA; on high salt 
content medium NaCl 6.5%; on alkaline medium pH 9.6) and genotypic approaches 
(16S rRNA, ITS genes sequencing and MLST technique) allowed to identify four 
genetically distinct strains of S. macedonicus. These four strains and two 
references, Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG 
(LGG), were tested for their capacity to survive at low pH values, and at 
different concentrations of an equimolar bile salts mixture (BSM). Two different 
cell lines, Caco-2 TC7 and HT29-MTX, were used for the adhesion study. The 
results show that S. macedonicus strains selected constitute a distinct genetic 
entity from the Greek strain S. macedonicus ACA-DC-198. They were able to 
survive up to pH 3 and could tolerate high concentrations of bile salts (10 mM), 
unlike LMD-9 and LGG strains. Our strains also display in vitro adhesion similar 
to the LGG strain on Caco-2 TC7 and higher adhesion than the LMD-9 strain to 
Caco-2 TC7 and HT29-MTX cell models. This first characterization allows 
considering S. macedonicus as a potential candidate for possible probiotic 
effects that need to be investigated.

Urease-producing bacteria are abundant in soils, which can precipitate calcium 
carbonate nanocrystals by enzymatic hydrolysis of urea in the presence of 
calcium ions. This process is known as microbially induced calcium carbonate 
precipitation (MICP), and it has received much attention in recent years as an 
eco-friendly technology. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to 
isolate local extremophile bacterial strains capable of producing calcium 
carbonate. Among a total of 44 isolated urease-producing strains from sandy 
soils, one strain with a high level of urease activity (8.16 U/ml) and 
production of a large amount of calcium carbonate (410 mg/100 ml) was selected 
for further investigation. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that this strain had 
99.66% sequence identity to Bhargavaea cecembensis. The SEM-EDX and XRD analyses 
indicated that irregular vaterite and aggregated nanocalcite were the dominant 
polymorphs produced by this strain. The size of these nanocalcite crystals 
ranged between 25 and 42 nm. The selected strain showed high levels of tolerance 
to different conditions of temperature, pH, and salinity. This strain grows at 
high temperatures up to 50 °C, alkaline pH (9-11), and high concentrations of 
NaCl (20-25% w/v). Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated 96% cell viability of 
the isolated strain after desiccation stress. Bhargavaea was first reported in 
2009 as a new genus, and it belongs to the Firmicutes. So far, there has been no 
report on its MICP potential. The present study is the first one to report 
nanocrystal calcium carbonate precipitation in polyextremophile Bhargavaea 
cecembensis, which makes it a suitable candidate for bio-cementation under 
extreme circumstances.

To enhance crop productivity and minimize the harmful effects of various 
environmental stresses, such as salinity and drought, farmers often use mineral 
fertilizers. However, inadequate or excessive fertilization can reduce plant 
growth and nutritive quality and contribute to soil degradation and 
environmental pollution. This study investigated the effects of salinity (0, 100 
or 150 mM NaCl) and nitrogen form (sole NO3- or NH4+, or combined NO3-:NH4+ at 
25:75 or 50:50) on growth, photosynthesis, and water and ion status of a 
commercial variety of maize (Zea mays SY Sincero). In the absence of NaCl, the 
media containing ammonium only or both nitrogen forms had higher aboveground 
growth rates than that containing nitrate only. Indeed, the maize growth, 
expressed as leaf dry matter, seen on NH4+ in the absence of salinity, was 
nearly double the biomass compared to that with NO3-treatment. Irrespective of N 
form, the presence of NaCl severely reduced leaf and roots growth; the presence 
of ammonium in the nutrient solution diminished these negative effects. Compared 
to the NH4+ only and combined treatments, the leaves of plants in the NO3--only 
medium showed signs of nitrogen deficiency (general chlorosis), which was more 
pronounced in the lower than upper leaves, indicating that nitrate is partly 
replaced by chloride during root uptake. NH4+ favored maize growth more than 
NO3-, especially when exposed to saline conditions, and may improve the plant's 
capacity to osmotically adjust to salinity by accumulating inorganic solutes.

With the ongoing climate change, African rainforests are expected to experience 
severe drought events in the future. In Africa, the tropical genus Erythrophleum 
(Fabaceae) includes two forest sister timber tree species displaying contrasting 
geographical distributions. Erythrophleum ivorense is adapted to wet evergreen 
Guineo-Congolian forests, whereas E. suaveolens occurs in a wider range of 
climates, being found in moist dense forests but also in gallery forests under a 
relatively drier climate. This geographical distribution pattern suggests that 
the two species might cope differently to drought at the genomic level. Yet, the 
genetic basis of tolerance response to drought stress in both species is still 
uncharacterized. To bridge this gap, we performed an RNA-seq approach on 
seedlings from each species to monitor their transcriptional responses at 
different levels of drought stress (0, 2 and 6 weeks after stopping watering 
seedlings). Monitoring of wilting symptoms revealed that E. suaveolens displayed 
an earlier phenotypic response to drought stress than E. ivorense. At the 
transcriptomic level, results revealed 2020 (1204 down-regulated/816 
up-regulated) and 1495 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to 
drought stress from a total of 67,432 and 66,605 contigs assembled in E. 
ivorense and E. suaveolens, respectively. After identifying 30,374 orthologs 
between species, we found that only 7 of them were DEGs shared between species, 
while 587 and 458 were differentially expressed only in E. ivorense or E. 
suaveolens, respectively. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the two 
species differ in terms of significantly regulated pathways as well as the 
number and expression profile of DEGs (Up/Down) associated with each pathway in 
the two stress stages. Our results suggested that the two studied species react 
differently to drought. E. suaveolens seems displaying a prompt response to 
drought at its early stage strengthened by the down-regulation of many DEGs 
encoding for signaling and metabolism-related pathways. A considerable 
up-regulation of these pathways was also found in E. ivorense at the late stage 
of drought, suggesting this species may be a late responder. Overall, our data 
may serve as basis for further understanding the genetic control of drought 
tolerance in tropical trees and favor the selection of crucial genes for

Though intensive research has been channeled towards the biotechnological 
applications of halophiles and other extremophilic microbes, these studies have 
not been, by any means, exhaustive. Saline environments still offer a vast 
diversity of microbes with potential to produce an array of natural products 
which can only be unlocked by concerted research efforts. In this study, a 
combination of culture and molecular approaches were employed to characterize 
halophilic bacteria from saltpan water samples and profile their potential 
biotechnological applications. Physicochemical analysis of the water samples 
showed that pH was alkaline (pH 8.8), with a salinity of 12.8%. 16S rRNA gene 
targeted amplicon analysis produced 10 bacterial phyla constituting of 
Bacteroidetes (30.57%), Proteobacteria (15.27%), Actinobacteria (9.05%), 
Planctomycetes (5.52%) and Cyanobacteria (3.18%). Eighteen strains were 
identified using sequencing analysis of the culturable bacterial strains. From 
these, the strains SP7 and SP9 were positive for cellulase production while the 
strains SP4, SP8 and SP22 were positive for lipase production. Quantitative 
enzyme assays showed moderate extracellular cellulase activity (1.95 U/mL) and 
lipase activity (3.71 U/mL) by the isolate SP9 and SP4 respectively. Further, of 
the six isolates, the isolate SP9 exhibited exploitable potential in the 
bioremediation of hydrocarbon pollution as demonstrated by its fairly high 
activity against benzanthracene (70% DCPIP reduction). Elucidation of the 
isolates secondary metabolites showed the production of the molecules 
2,3-butanediol, hexahydro-3-(2-methylpropyl)pyrrole[1,2a]pyrazine-1,4-dione, 
aziridine, dimethylamine and ethyl acetate (GC-MS) and oxypurinol and 
5-hydroxydecanoic acid (LC-MS), particularly by the isolate Salinivibrio sp. 
SP9. Overall, the study showed that the isolated halophiles can produce 
secondary metabolites with potential industrial and pharmaceutical application.

Alkaliphilic organisms are among an industrially important class of extremophile 
microorganisms with the ability to thrive at pH 10-11.5. Microorganisms that 
exhibit alkaliphilic characteristics are sources of alkali-tolerant enzymes such 
as proteases, starch degrading enzymes, cellulases, and metabolites such as 
antibiotics, enzyme inhibitors, siderophores, organic acids, and cholic acid 
derivatives, which have found various applications in industry for human and 
environmental health. Yet, multi-omics mechanisms governing adaptation to high 
alkalinity have been poorly studied. We undertook the present work to 
understand, as a case study, the alkaliphilic adaptation strategy of the novel 
microorganism, Bacillus marmarensis DSM 21297, to alkaline conditions using a 
multi-omics approach that employed transcriptomics and proteomics. As alkalinity 
increased, bacteria remodeled the peptidoglycan layer by changing peptide 
moieties along with the peptidoglycan constituents and altered the cell membrane 
to reduce lipid motility and proton leakiness to adjust intracellular pH. 
Different transporters also contributed to the maintenance of this pH 
homeostasis. However, unlike in most well-known alkaliphiles, not only sodium 
ions but also potassium ions were involved in this process. Interestingly, 
increased pH has triggered the expression of neither general stress proteins nor 
gene encoding proteins associated with heat, salt, and nutrient stresses. Only 
an increase in the expression of oxidative stress related genes was evident. 
Endospore formation, also a phenomenon closely linked to stress, was unclear. 
This questioned if high pH was a real stress for B. marmarensis. These new 
findings, corroborated using the multi-omics approach of the present case study, 
broaden the knowledge on the mechanisms of alkaliphilic adaptation and might 
also potentially offer useful departure points for further industrial 
applications with other microorganisms.

Increase photorespiration and optimising intrinsic water use efficiency are 
unique challenges to photosynthetic carbon fixation at elevated temperatures. To 
determine how plants can adapt to facilitate high rates of photorespiration at 
elevated temperatures while also maintaining water-use efficiency, we performed 
in-depth gas exchange and biochemical assays of the C3 extremophile, Rhazya 
stricta. These results demonstrate that R. stricta supports higher rates of 
photorespiration under elevated temperatures and that these higher rates of 
photorespiration correlate with increased activity of key photorespiratory 
enzymes; phosphoglycolate phosphatase and catalase. The increased 
photorespiratory enzyme activities may increase the overall capacity of 
photorespiration by reducing enzymatic bottlenecks and allowing minimal 
inhibitor accumulation under high photorespiratory rates. Additionally, we found 
the CO2 transfer conductances (stomatal and mesophyll) are re-allocated to 
increase the water-use efficiency in R. stricta but not necessarily the 
photosynthetic response to temperature. These results suggest important adaptive 
strategies in R. stricta that maintain photosynthetic rates under elevated 
temperatures with optimal water loss. The strategies found in R. stricta may 
inform breeding and engineering efforts in other C3 species to improve 
photosynthetic efficiency at high temperatures.

This work explores the proton/hydroxide permeability (PH+/OH-) of membranes that 
were made of synthetic extremophile-inspired phospholipids with systematically 
varied structural elements. A fluorescence-based permeability assay was 
optimized to determine the effects on the PH+/OH- through liposome membranes 
with variations in the following lipid attributes: transmembrane tethering, 
tether length, and the presence of isoprenoid methyl groups on one or both lipid 
tails. All permeability assays were performed in the presence of a low 
concentration of valinomycin (10 nM) to prevent buildup of a membrane potential 
without artificially increasing the measured PH+/OH-. Surprisingly, the presence 
of a transmembrane tether did not impact PH+/OH- at room temperature. Among 
tethered lipid monolayers, PH+/OH- increased with increasing tether length if 
the number of carbons in the untethered acyl tail was constant. Untethered 
lipids with two isoprenoid methyl tails led to lower PH+/OH- values than lipids 
with only one or no isoprenoid tails. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed a 
strong positive correlation between the probability of observing water molecules 
in the hydrophobic core of these lipid membranes and their proton permeability. 
We propose that water penetration as revealed by molecular dynamics may provide 
a general strategy for predicting proton permeability through various lipid 
membranes without the need for experimentation.

Lake Sayram is an ancient cold water lake locating at a mountain basin in 
Xinjiang, China. The lake water is brackish, alkaline, unpolluted, and abundant 
in SO4(2-) and Mg(2+). The lacustrine ecosystem of Lake Sayram has been 
intensely investigated. However, profiles of the microbial communities in the 
lake remain largely unknown. In this study, taxonomic compositions of the 
planktonic and sedimentary bacterial communities in Lake Sayram were 
investigated using 16S rRNA metagenomics. The lacustrine bacterial communities 
were generally structured by environmental conditions, including the 
hydrological and physicochemical parameters. Proteobacteria was the dominating 
phylum. In the lake water, the genera Acinetobacter and Ilumatobacter held an 
absolute predominance, implying their metabolic significance. In the bottom 
sediment, biogeochemically significant bacteria and thermophilic or 
acidothermophilic extremophiles were recovered. In contrast to the planktonic 
bacteria, an appreciable portion of the sedimentary bacteria could not be 
classified into any known taxonomic unit, indicating the largely unknown 
bacteriosphere hiding in the bottom sediment of Lake Sayram.

An extremely halophilic archaeon Natrialba aegyptiaca produces extracellular 
poly-gamma-glutamate (PGA), in which only L-glutamate is polymerized via 
gamma-amide linkages. We examined the extremolyte-like applicability of archaeal 
PGA and found the ameliorating effects of L-PGA on the resistibility to 
freeze-thawing and proteolysis, thermostability, and alkalotolerance of a model 
enzyme, labile DNA ligase. For example, the coexistence of low (e.g. 0.01 mg 
mL(-1)) and high (e.g. 0.1 mg mL(-1)) concentrations of L-PGA with an average 
molecular mass of 1000 kDa increased the midpoint of thermal inactivation of DNA 
ligase by about 15 degrees C and 18 degrees C, respectively, and the model 
enzyme further remained active even under extremely alkaline conditions of pH 
11.4 in the presence of the high concentration of L-PGA. This is the first 
characterization of the stereo-regular PGA molecules as atypical extremolytes. 
L-PGA from extremophiles has great potential as a bio-based protectant (or 
stabilizer) with industrial versatility.

We identified cultivable fungi present in the glacial ice fragments collected in 
nine sites across Antarctica Peninsula and assessed their abilities to produce 
bioactive compounds. Three ice fragments with approximately 20 kg were 
collected, melted and 3 L filtered through of 0.45 µm sterilized membranes, 
which were placed on the media Sabouraud agar and minimal medium incubated at 
10 °C. We collected 66 isolates classified into 27 taxa of 14 genera. 
Penicillium palitans, Penicillium sp. 1, Thelebolus balaustiformis, Glaciozyma 
antarctica, Penicillium sp. 7, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, and Rhodotorula 
dairenensis had the highest frequencies. The diversity and richness of the 
fungal community were high with moderate dominance. Penicillium species were 
present in all samples, with Penicillium chrysogenum showing the broadest 
distribution. P. chrysogenum, P. palitans, and Penicillium spp. had 
trypanocidal, leishmanicidal, and herbicidal activities, with P. chrysogenum 
having the broadest and highest capability. 1H NMR signals revealed the presence 
of highly functionalized secondary metabolites in the bioactive extracts. 
Despite extreme environmental conditions, glacial ice harbours a diverse fungal 
community, including species never before recorded in the Arctic and Antarctica. 
Among them, Penicillium taxa may represent wild fungal strains with genetic and 
biochemical pathways that may produce new secondary bioactive metabolites.

Microbial ecology of permafrost, due to its ecological and astrobiological 
importance, has been in the focus of studies in past decades. Although 
permafrost is an ancient and stable environment, it is also subjected to current 
climate changes. Permafrost degradation often results in generation of thaw 
ponds, a phenomenon not only reported mainly from polar regions but also present 
in high-altitude permafrost environments. Our knowledge about microbial 
communities of thaw ponds in these unique, remote mountain habitats is sparse. 
This study presents the first culture collection and results of the 
next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) analysis of bacterial communities 
inhabiting a high-altitude permafrost thaw pond. In February 2016, a permafrost 
thaw pond on the Ojos del Salado at 5900 m a.s.l. (meters above sea level) was 
sampled as part of the Hungarian Dry Andes Research Programme. A culture 
collection of 125 isolates was established, containing altogether 11 genera 
belonging to phyla Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. Simplified 
bacterial communities with a high proportion of candidate and hitherto 
uncultured bacteria were revealed by Illumina MiSeq NGS. Water of the thaw pond 
was dominated by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, while in the sediment of the 
lake and permafrost, members of Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, 
Patescibacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia were abundant. This 
permafrost habitat can be interesting as a potential Mars analog.

A new, obligately methylotrophic, methane-oxidizing bacterium, strain AMO 1, was 
isolated from a mixed sample of sediments from five highly alkaline soda lakes 
(Kenya). Based on its cell ultrastructure and high activity of the 
hexulose-6-phosphate synthase, the new isolate belongs to the type I 
methanotrophs. It differed, however, from the known neutrophilic methanotrophs 
by the ability to grow and oxidize methane at high pH values. The bacterium grew 
optimally with methane at pH 9-10. The oxidation of methane, methanol, and 
formaldehyde was optimal at pH 10, and cells were still active up to pH 11. AMO 
1 was able to oxidize ammonia to nitrite at high pH. A maximal production of 
nitrite from ammonia in batch cultures at pH 10 was observed with 10% of CH4 in 
the gas phase when nitrate was present as nitrogen source. Washed cells of AMO 1 
oxidized ammonia most actively at pH 10-10.5 in the presence of limiting amounts 
of methanol or CH4. The bacterium was also capable of oxidizing organic sulfur 
compounds at high pH. Washed cells grown with methane exhibited high activity of 
CS2 oxidation and low, but detectable, levels of DMS and DMDS oxidation. The GC 
content of AMO 1 was 50.9mol%. It showed only weak DNA homology with the 
previously described alkaliphilic methanotroph ""Methylobacter alcaliphilus"" 
strain 20Z and with the neutrophilic species of the genera Methylobacter and 
Methylomonas. According to the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain AMO 1 was 
most closely related to a neutrophilic methanotroph, Methylomicrobium pelagicum 
(98.2% sequence similarity), within the gamma-Proteobacteria.

This study describes, for the first time, the water chemistry and microbial 
diversity in Dziani Dzaha, a tropical crater lake located on Mayotte Island 
(Comoros archipelago, Western Indian Ocean). The lake water had a high level of 
dissolved matter and high alkalinity (10.6-14.5 g L-1 eq. CO32-, i.e. 160-220 mM 
compare to around 2-2.5 in seawater), with salinity up to 52 psu, 1.5 higher 
than seawater. Hierarchical clustering discriminated Dziani Dzaha water from 
other alkaline, saline lakes, highlighting its thalassohaline nature. The 
phytoplankton biomass was very high, with a total chlorophyll a concentration of 
524 to 875 μg chl a L-1 depending on the survey, homogeneously distributed from 
surface to bottom (4 m). Throughout the whole water column the photosynthetic 
biomass was dominated (>97% of total biovolume) by the filamentous cyanobacteria 
Arthrospira sp. with a straight morphotype. In situ daily photosynthetic oxygen 
production ranged from 17.3 to 22.2 g O2 m-2 d-1, consistent with experimental 
production / irradiance measurements and modeling. Heterotrophic 
bacterioplankton was extremely abundant, with cell densities up to 1.5 108 cells 
mL-1 in the whole water column. Isolation and culture of 59 Eubacteria strains 
revealed the prevalence of alkaliphilic and halophilic organisms together with 
taxa unknown to date, based on 16S rRNA gene analysis. A single 
cloning-sequencing approach using archaeal 16S rDNA gene primers unveiled the 
presence of diverse extremophilic Euryarchaeota. The water chemistry of Dziani 
Dzaha Lake supports the hypothesis that it was derived from seawater and 
strongly modified by geological conditions and microbial activities that 
increased the alkalinity. Dziani Dzaha has a unique consortium of cyanobacteria, 
phytoplankton, heterotrophic Eubacteria and Archaea, with very few unicellular 
protozoa, that will deserve further deep analysis to unravel its uncommon 
diversity. A single taxon, belonging to the genus Arthrospira, was found 
responsible for almost all photosynthetic primary production.

In this work, two archaea microorganisms (Haloferax volcanii and Natrialba 
magadii) used as biocatalyst at a microbial fuel cell (MFC) anode were 
evaluated. Both archaea are able to grow at high salt concentrations. By 
increasing the media conductivity, the internal resistance was diminished, 
improving the MFC's performance. Without any added redox mediator, maximum power 
(P (max)) and current at P (max) were 11.87/4.57/0.12 μW cm(-2) and 
49.67/22.03/0.59 μA cm(-2) for H. volcanii, N. magadii and E. coli, 
respectively. When neutral red was used as the redox mediator, P (max) was 50.98 
and 5.39 μW cm(-2) for H. volcanii and N. magadii, respectively. In this paper, 
an archaea MFC is described and compared with other MFC systems; the high salt 
concentration assayed here, comparable with that used in Pt-catalyzed alkaline 
hydrogen fuel cells, will open new options when MFC scaling up is the objective 
necessary for practical applications.

Built systems such as water heaters can harbor extremophiles similar to those 
residing in natural hot springs, but the extent of colonization is not well 
understood. To address this, we conducted a survey of thermophilic 
microorganisms in household water heaters across the United States. Filter 
samples and inoculated cultures were collected by citizen-scientists from 101 
homes. Draft genomes were assembled from cultured isolates and 16S rRNA genes 
were sequenced from filter samples. 28% of households harbored communities with 
unambiguous DNA signatures of thermophilic organisms, 36% of households provided 
viable inocula, and 21% of households had both. All of the recovered cultures as 
well as the community sequencing results revealed Thermus scotoductus to be the 
dominant thermophile in domestic water heaters, with a minority of water heaters 
also containing Meiothermus species and a few containing Aquificae. Sequence 
distance comparisons show that allopatric speciation does not appear to be a 
strong control on T. scotoductus distribution. Our results demonstrate that 
thermophilic organisms are widespread in hot tap water, and that Thermus 
scotoductus preferentially colonizes water heaters at the expense of local 
environmental Thermus strains.

In this work, we have characterized the diversity of phytoplanktonic species in 
a highly alkaline and hypereutrophic shallow lake, Santa Olalla (southwestern 
Spain), the evolution of their relative abundances, and that of several 
physicochemical parameters over 2 years. In the absence of an external input of 
alkaline water, Santa Olalla's stable high pH (average pH 9.52, with several 
maxima >10.5) is explained by an extremely high photosynthetic primary 
productivity. A variety of phytoplankton species was observed even during pH 
maxima. These included several species of green algae, diatoms, and euglenoids 
and several cyanobacteria from the orders Nostocales and Chroococcales. 
Quantitatively, cyanobacteria dominated. A blooming event due to Aphanothece 
clathrata was observed at one pH maximum, during which the diversity as measured 
by the Shannon-Weaver index was extremely low. Santa Olalla's cyanobacteria are 
alkaliphilic and/or extremely alkalitolerant and appear to be responsible for 
the generation and maintenance of stable high-pH conditions in their 
environment.

Bacterial and yeast isolates recovered from a deep Antarctic ice core were 
screened for proteins with ice-binding activity, an indicator of adaptation to 
icy environments. A bacterial strain recovered from glacial ice at a depth of 
3,519 m, just above the accreted ice from Subglacial Lake Vostok, was found to 
produce a 54 kDa ice-binding protein (GenBank EU694412) that is similar to 
ice-binding proteins previously found in sea ice diatoms, a snow mold, and a sea 
ice bacterium. The protein has the ability to inhibit the recrystallization of 
ice, a phenotype that has clear advantages for survival in ice.

An enzyme with catechol oxidase activity was identified in Thermomicrobium 
roseum extracts via solution assays and activity-stained SDS-PAGE. Yet, the 
genome of T. roseum does not harbor a catecholase gene. The enzyme was purified 
with two anion exchange chromatography steps and ultimately identified to be a 
manganese catalase with additional peroxidase and catecholase activity. Catalase 
activity (6280 ± 430 IU/mg) clearly dominated over pyrogallol peroxidase 
(231 ± 53 IU/mg) and catecholase (3.07 ± 0.56 IU/mg) activity as determined at 
70 °C. Most enzyme kinetic properties were comparable to previously 
characterized manganese catalase enzymes. Catalase activity was highest at 
alkaline pH values and showed inhibition by excess substrate and chloride. The 
apparent K m and k cat values were 20 mM and 2.02 × 104 s-1 subunit-1 at 25 °C 
and pH 7.0.

The chenopod Beta macrocarpa Guss (wild Swiss chard) is known for its salt 
tolerance, but the mechanisms involved are still debated. In order to elucidate 
the processes involved, we grew wild Swiss chard exposed to three salinity 
levels (0, 100 and 200 mm NaCl) for 45 days, and determined several 
physiological parameters at the end of this time. All plants survived despite 
reductions in growth, photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in plants exposed 
to salinity (100 and 200 mm NaCl). As expected, the negative effects of salinity 
were more pronounced at 200 mm than at 100 mm NaCl: (i) leaf apoplastic water 
content was maintained or increased despite a significant reduction in leaf 
water potential, revealing the halophytic character of B. macrocarpa; (ii) 
osmotic adjustment occurred, which presumably enhanced the driving force for 
water extraction from soil, and avoided toxic build up of Na(+) and Cl(-) in the 
mesophyll apoplast of leaves. Osmotic adjustment mainly occurred through 
accumulation of inorganic ions and to a lesser extent soluble sugars; proline 
was not implicated in osmotic adjustment. Overall, two important mechanisms of 
salt tolerance in B. macrocarpa were identified: osmotic and apoplastic water 
adjustment.

An alkaliphilic bacterium, strain AHO 1, was isolated from an enrichment culture 
with hydrogen at pH 10 inoculated with a composite sample of sediments from five 
highly alkaline soda lakes (Kenya). This bacterium is a gram-negative, 
nonmotile, rod-shaped, obligately aerobic, and facultatively autotrophic 
hydrogen-oxidizing organism. It was able to oxidize reduced sulfur compounds to 
sulfate during heterotrophic growth. It utilized a wide range of organic 
compounds as carbon and energy sources and grew mixotrophically with hydrogen 
and acetate. With sulfur compounds, mixotrophic growth was observed only in 
acetate-limited continuous culture. The normal pH range for autotrophic growth 
with hydrogen was pH 8.0-10.25, with a pH optimum at 9-9.5. Growth at pH values 
lower than 8.0 was extremely slow. Heterotrophic growth with acetate was optimal 
at pH 10.0. The hydrogen-oxidizing activity of whole cells was maximal at pH 9.0 
and still substantial up to pH 11. NAD-dependent hydrogenase activity was found 
in the soluble fraction of the cell-free extract, but no methylene 
blue-dependent activity in either the soluble or membrane fractions was 
observed. On the basis of its pH profile, the soluble hydrogenase of strain AHO 
1 was a typical pH-neutral enzyme. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that strain 
AHO 1 belongs to the alpha-3 subgroup of the Proteobacteria with a closest 
relation to a recently described alkaliphilic aerobic bacteriochlorophyll 
a-containing bacterium ""Roseinatronobacter thiooxidans.""

The aerobic thermoalkaliphile Caldalkalibacillus thermarum strain TA2.A1 is a 
member of a separate order of alkaliphilic bacteria closely related to the 
Bacillales order. Efforts to relate the genomic information of this evolutionary 
ancient organism to environmental adaptation have been thwarted by the inability 
to construct a complete genome. The existing draft genome is highly fragmented 
due to repetitive regions, and gaps between and over repetitive regions were 
unbridgeable. To address this, Oxford Nanopore Technology's MinION allowed us to 
span these repeats through long reads, with over 6000-fold coverage. This 
resulted in a single 3.34 Mb circular chromosome. The profile of transporters 
and central metabolism gives insight into why the organism prefers glutamate 
over sucrose as carbon source. We propose that the deamination of glutamate 
allows alkalization of the immediate environment, an excellent example of how an 
extremophile modulates environmental conditions to suit its own requirements. 
Curiously, plant-like hallmark electron transfer enzymes and transporters are 
found throughout the genome, such as a cytochrome b6c1 complex and a 
CO2-concentrating transporter. In addition, multiple self-splicing group II 
intron-encoded proteins closely aligning to those of a telomerase reverse 
transcriptase in Arabidopsis thaliana were revealed. Collectively, these 
features suggest an evolutionary relationship to plant life.

Proteases, one of the largest groups of industrial enzymes occupy a major share 
in detergent industry. To meet the existing demands, proteases with efficient 
catalytic properties are being explored from bacteria residing in extreme 
habitats. Alkaline proteases are also considered as promising candidates for 
industrial sectors due to the activity and stability under alkaline and harsh 
environment. Therefore, a systematic review on experimental studies of bacterial 
proteases was conducted with emphasis on purification, characterization, cloning 
and expression and their suitability as detergent additive. Relevant searches 
using a combination of filters/keywords were performed in the online databases; 
PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science. Over thousands of research 
papers, 71 articles in Scopus, 48 articles in Science Direct, 18 articles in 
PubMed and 8 articles in Web of Science were selected with regard to bacterial 
extracellular proteases till date. Selected articles revealed majority of the 
studies conducted between the years 2015 and 17 and were focused on purification 
of proteases from bacteria. Among microbes, a total of 41 bacterial genera have 
been explored with limited studies from extreme habitats. Majority of the 
studies have reported the involvement of subtilisin-like serine proteases with 
effective properties for detergent industries. The studies revealed shifting of 
trend from purification to cloning to genetic engineering to meet the industrial 
demands. The present systematic review describes the proteases from 
extremophilic bacteria and use of biotechnological techniques such as 
site-directed mutagenesis and codon optimization to engineer enzymes with better 
hot spots in the active sites to meet industrial challenges.

This study evaluates the potential application of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) 
as antimicrobial or nematicidal agents produced by the extremophile Bacillus 
pumilus, which was isolated from the alkaline Wadi El-Natrun Lake in Egypt. The 
AgNPs were characterized by ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, 
transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The 
size of AgNPs formed ranged from 20.12 to 29.48 nm. Panagrellus redivivus was 
exposed to different concentrations (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 μg/mL) of AgNPs in 
a 5 mL nematode suspension (1 × 103 mL-1). The best result occurred at AgNP 
concentrations of 150 and 200 μg/mL, with death rates of 80 and 91%, 
respectively, following 48 h of exposure. AgNPs also exhibited potent 
antimicrobial properties when using Gram-negative and Gram-positive human 
pathogens, with MIC and MBC values of 5 and 10 μg/mL, respectively. These 
laboratory assays prove that biologically synthesized AgNPs are an ecofriendly 
material that can be used in lieu of solvents or toxic chemicals.

The majority of microorganisms in natural environments resist laboratory 
cultivation. Sometimes referred to as 'unculturable', many phylogenetic groups 
are known only by fragments of recovered DNA. As a result, the ecological 
significance of whole branches of the 'tree of life' remains a mystery; this is 
particularly true when regarding genetic material retrieved from extreme 
environments. Geochemically relevant media have been used to improve the success 
of culturing Archaea and Bacteria, but these efforts have focused primarily on 
optimizing pH, alkalinity, major ions, carbon sources, and electron 
acceptor-donor pairs. Here, we cultured thermophilic microorganisms from 'Sylvan 
Spring' (Yellowstone National Park, USA) on media employing different trace 
element solutions, including one that mimicked the source fluid of the inocula. 
The growth medium that best simulated trace elements found in 'Sylvan Spring' 
produced a more diverse and faster growing mixed culture than media containing 
highly elevated trace element concentrations. The elevated trace element medium 
produced fewer phylotypes and inhibited growth. Trace element concentrations 
appear to influence growth conditions in extreme environments. Incorporating 
geochemical data into cultivation attempts may improve culturing success.

The requirements for life on Earth, its elemental composition, and its 
environmental limits provide a way to assess the habitability of exoplanets. 
Temperature is key both because of its influence on liquid water and because it 
can be directly estimated from orbital and climate models of exoplanetary 
systems. Life can grow and reproduce at temperatures as low as -15 °C, and as 
high as 122 °C. Studies of life in extreme deserts show that on a dry world, 
even a small amount of rain, fog, snow, and even atmospheric humidity can be 
adequate for photosynthetic production producing a small but detectable 
microbial community. Life is able to use light at levels less than 10(-5) of the 
solar flux at Earth. UV or ionizing radiation can be tolerated by many 
microorganisms at very high levels and is unlikely to be life limiting on an 
exoplanet. Biologically available nitrogen may limit habitability. Levels of O2 
over a few percent on an exoplanet would be consistent with the presence of 
multicellular organisms and high levels of O2 on Earth-like worlds indicate 
oxygenic photosynthesis. Other factors such as pH and salinity are likely to 
vary and not limit life over an entire planet or moon.

Lake Van harbors the largest known microbialites on Earth. The surface of these 
huge carbonate pinnacles is covered by coccoid cyanobacteria whereas their 
central axis is occupied by a channel through which neutral, relatively 
Ca-enriched, groundwater flows into highly alkaline (pH approximately 9.7) 
Ca-poor lake water. Previous microscopy observations showed the presence of 
aragonite globules composed by rounded nanostructures of uncertain origin that 
resemble similar bodies found in some meteorites. Here, we have carried out 
fine-scale mineralogical and microbial diversity analyses from surface and 
internal microbialite samples. Electron transmission microscopy revealed that 
the nanostructures correspond to rounded aragonite nanoprecipitates. A 
progressive mineralization of cells by the deposition of nanoprecipitates on 
their surface was observed from external towards internal microbialite areas. 
Molecular diversity studies based on 16S rDNA amplification revealed the 
presence of bacterial lineages affiliated to the Alpha-, Beta- and 
Gammaproteobacteria, the Cyanobacteria, the Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides 
(CFB) group, the Actinobacteria and the Firmicutes. Cyanobacteria and CFB 
members were only detected in surface layers. The most abundant and diverse 
lineages were the Firmicutes (low GC Gram positives). To the exclusion of 
cyanobacteria, the closest cultivated members to the Lake Van phylotypes were 
most frequently alkaliphilic and/or heterotrophic bacteria able to degrade 
complex organics. These heterotrophic bacteria may play a crucial role in the 
formation of Lake Van microbialites by locally promoting carbonate 
precipitation.

Archaea constitute a substantial fraction of marine microbial biomass and play 
critical roles in the biogeochemistry of oceans. However, studies on their 
distribution and ecology in the Arctic Ocean are relatively scarce. Here, we 
studied the distributions of archaea and archaeal ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) 
gene in the western Arctic Ocean, using the amplicon sequencing approach from 
the sea surface to deep waters up to 3040 m depth. A total of five archaeal 
phyla, Nitrososphaerota, ""Euryarchaeota"", ""Halobacteriota,"" ""Nanoarchaeota"", and 
Candidatus Thermoplasmatota, were detected. We observed a clear, depth-dependent 
vertical segregation among archaeal communities. Ca. Thermoplasmatota (66.8%) 
was the most dominant phylum in the surface waters. At the same time, 
Nitrososphaerota (55.9%) was dominant in the deep waters. Most of the amoA gene 
OTUs (99%) belonged to the Nitrosopumilales and were further clustered into five 
subclades (""NP-Alpha"", ""NP-Delta"", ""NP-Epsilon"", ""NP-Gamma"", and ""NP-Theta""). 
""NP-Epsilon"" was the most dominant clade throughout the water column and 
""NP_Alpha"" showed higher abundance only in the deeper water. Salinity and 
inorganic nutrient concentrations were the major factors that determined the 
vertical segregation of archaea. We anticipate that the observed differences in 
the vertical distribution of archaea might contribute to the 
compartmentalization of dark carbon fixation and nitrification in deeper water 
and organic matter degradation in surface waters of the Arctic Ocean.

Rhizosphere microbial communities play an important role in maintaining the 
health and productivity of the plant host. The rhizobacteria Pseudomonas putida 
P2 of Ramonda serbica and Bacillus cereus P5 of R. nathaliae were selected for 
treatment of the Belija wheat cultivar because of their plant growth-promoting 
(PGP) properties. Compared to the non-treated drought-stressed plants, the 
plants treated with rhizobacteria showed increased activity of the two major 
antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, and ascorbate peroxidase. Plants 
treated with the B. cereus P5 strain exhibited higher proline content under 
drought stress, suggesting that proline accumulation depends on the relative 
water content (RWC) status of the plants studied. Inoculation of wheat seeds 
with the P. putida P2 strain improved water status by increasing RWC and 
alleviating oxidative stress by reducing H2O2 and malondialdehyde concentrations 
in plants exposed to severe drought, possibly also helping plants to overcome 
drought through its 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase activity. 
Analysis of data from Next Generation sequencing (NGS) revealed that the 
dominant bacterial taxa in the rhizosphere of resurrection plants R. serbica and 
R. nathaliae were extremophilic, thermotolerant, Vicinamibacter silvestris, 
Chthoniobacter flavus, and Gaiella occulta. From the fungi detected Penicillium 
was the most abundant in both samples, while Fusarium and Mucor were present 
only in the rhizosphere of R. serbica and the entomopathogenic fungi 
Metarhizium, and Tolypocladiumu only in the rhizosphere of R. nathaliae. The 
fungal communities varied among plants, suggesting a stronger environmental 
influence than plant species. Our study demonstrates the importance of in vivo 
experiments to confirm the properties of PGP bacteria and indicates that the 
rhizosphere of resurrection plants is a valuable source of unique microorganisms 
that can be used to improve the drought stress tolerance of crops.

In April 2014, dual bloom of green algae and purple bacteria occurred in a 
shallow, alkaline soda pan (Kiskunság National Park, Hungary). The water was 
only 5 cm deep, in which an upper green layer was clearly separated from a 
near-sediment purple one. Based on microscopy and DNA-based identification, the 
upper was inhabited by a dense population of the planktonic green alga, Oocystis 
submarina Lagerheim, while the deeper layer was formed by purple, 
bacteriochlorophyll-containing bacteria, predominated by Thiorhodospira and 
Rhodobaca. Additional bacterial taxa with a presumed capability of anoxygenic 
phototrophic growth belonged to the genera Loktanella and Porphyrobacter. 
Comparing the bacterial community of the purple layer with a former blooming 
event in a nearby soda pan, similar functional but different taxonomic 
composition was revealed. Members from many dominant bacterial groups were 
successfully cultivated including potentially new species, which could be the 
result of the application of newly designed media.

Following a screening of Antarctic glacier forefield-bacteria for novel 
cold-active enzymes, a psychrophilic strain Psychrobacter sp. 94-6PB was 
selected for further characterization of enzymatic activities. The strain 
produced lipases and proteases in the temperature range of 4-18°C. The coding 
sequence of an extracellular serine-protease was then identified via comparative 
analysis across Psychrobacter sp. genomes, PCR-amplified in our strain 94-6PB 
and expressed in the heterologous host E. coli. The purified enzyme (80 kDa) 
resulted to be a cold-active alkaline protease, performing best at temperatures 
of 20-30°C and pH 7-9. It was stable in presence of common inhibitors 
[β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), dithiothreitol (DTT), urea, phenylmethylsulfonyl 
fluoride (PMSF) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)] and compatible with 
detergents and surfactants (Tween 20, Tween 80, hydrogen peroxide and Triton 
X-100). Because of these properties, the P94-6PB protease may be suitable for 
use in a new generation of laundry products for cold washing. Furthermore, we 
assessed the microdiversity of this enzyme in Psychrobacter organisms from 
different cold habitats and found several gene clusters that correlated with 
specific ecological niches. We then discussed the role of habitat specialization 
in shaping the biodiversity of proteins and enzymes and anticipate far-reaching 
implications for the search of novel variants of biotechnological products.

Alkaliphily, the ability of an organism to thrive optimally at high ambient pH, 
has been well-documented in several lineages: archaea, bacteria and fungi. The 
molecular mechanics of such adaptation has been extensively addressed in 
alkaliphilic bacteria and alkalitolerant fungi. In this study, we consider an 
additional property that may have enabled fungi to prosper at alkaline pH: 
altered contents of membrane lipids and cytoprotectant molecules. In the 
alkaliphilic Sodiomyces tronii, we showed that at its optimal growth pH 9.2, the 
fungus accumulates abundant cytosolic trehalose (4-10% dry weight) and 
phosphatidic acids in the membrane lipids, properties not normally observed in 
neutrophilic species. At a very high pH 10.2, the major carbohydrate, glucose, 
was rapidly substituted by mannitol and arabitol. Conversely, lowering the pH to 
5.4-7.0 had major implications both on the content of carbohydrates and membrane 
lipids. It was shown that trehalose dominated at pH 5.4. Fractions of 
sphingolipids and sterols of plasma membranes rapidly elevated possibly 
indicating the formation of membrane structures called rafts. Overall, our 
results reveals complex dynamics of the contents of membrane lipids and 
cytoplasmic sugars in alkaliphilic S. tronii, suggesting their adaptive 
functionality against pH stress.

Berkeley Pit Lake, Butte, Montana, is a 540 m deep abandoned open-pit copper 
mine filled with over 140 billion liters of acidic, metal-sulfate-contaminated 
water. This harsh environment has yielded several microorganisms that produce 
interesting biologically active compounds. Several polyketide metabolites 
including the new berkazaphilones A (1) and B (2) and octadienoic acid 
derivatives berkedienoic acid (13) and berkedienolactone (15), as well as 
previously reported azaphilone 4, vermistatin (6), dihydrovermistatin (7), 
penisimplicissin (8), aldehyde 9, and methylparaconic acid (11), were isolated 
from a culture broth of Penicillium rubrum taken from a depth of 270 m. The 
structures of these compounds were deduced by interpretation of spectroscopic 
data. The compounds were isolated either for their inhibition of the signal 
transduction enzyme caspase-1 or because of their structural similarity to these 
inhibitors. Selected compounds were further evaluated for their ability to 
inhibit interleukin-1β production by inflammasomes in induced THP-1 cells. 
Berkazaphilones B (2) and C (4) and vermistatin analogue penisimplicissin (8) 
exhibited selective activity against leukemia cancer cell lines in the National 
Cancer Institute 60 human cell line assay.

Examination of aquaporin (AQP) membrane channels in extremophile plants may 
increase our understanding of plant tolerance to high salt, drought or other 
conditions. Here, we cloned a tonoplast AQP gene (TsTIP1;2) from the halophyte 
Thellungiella salsuginea and characterized its biological functions. TsTIP1;2 
transcripts accumulate to high levels in several organs, increasing in response 
to multiple external stimuli. Ectopic overexpression of TsTIP1;2 in Arabidopsis 
significantly increased plant tolerance to drought, salt and oxidative stresses. 
TsTIP1;2 had water channel activity when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. TsTIP1;2 
was also able to conduct H₂O₂ molecules into yeast cells in response to 
oxidative stress. TsTIP1;2 was not permeable to Na(+) in Xenopus oocytes, but it 
could facilitate the entry of Na(+) ions into plant cell vacuoles by an indirect 
process under high-salinity conditions. Collectively, these data showed that 
TsTIP1;2 could mediate the conduction of both H₂O and H₂O₂ across membranes, and 
may act as a multifunctional contributor to survival of T. salsuginea in highly 
stressful habitats.

Terrestrial serpentinizing systems harbor microbial subsurface life. Passive or 
active microbially mediated iron transformations at alkaline conditions in deep 
biosphere serpentinizing ecosystems are understudied. We explore these processes 
in the Zambales (Philippines) and Coast Range (CA, USA) ophiolites, and 
associated surface ecosystems by probing the relevance of samples acquired at 
the surface to in situ, subsurface ecosystems, and the nature of microbe-mineral 
associations in the subsurface. In this pilot study, we use microcosm 
experiments and batch culturing directed at iron redox transformations to 
confirm thermodynamically based predictions that iron transformations may be 
important in subsurface serpentinizing ecosystems. Biofilms formed on rock cores 
from the Zambales ophiolite on surface and in-pit associations, confirming that 
organisms from serpentinizing systems can form biofilms in subsurface 
environments. Analysis by XPS and FTIR confirmed that enrichment culturing 
utilizing ferric iron growth substrates produced reduced, magnetic solids 
containing siderite, spinels, and FeO minerals. Microcosms and enrichment 
cultures supported organisms whose near relatives participate in iron redox 
transformations. Further, a potential 'principal' microbial community common to 
solid samples in serpentinizing systems was identified. These results indicate 
collectively that iron redox transformations should be more thoroughly and 
universally considered when assessing the function of terrestrial subsurface 
ecosystems driven by serpentinization.

Lipases have a characteristic folding pattern of α/β-hydrolase with mostly 
parallel β-sheets, flanked on both sides by α-helixes in the structure. The 
active site is formed by a catalytic triad (serine, aspartic/glutamic acid, and 
histidine), which is highly conserved. In this study, we have used an integrated 
experimental and computational approach to identify the extremophilic microbial 
lipases from the saline habitats of the Thar Desert of Rajasthan. 
Lipase-producing bacteria were screened and a few samples showed significant 
lipase activity in both quantitative and qualitative experiments. 16S rRNA 
sequence analysis of the isolate F1 showed that its sequence is quite similar to 
that of Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus haynesii, indicating that this 
isolate belongs to a new subspecies of Bacillus. The isolate F7 showed maximum 
sequence identity with Bacillus tequilensis strain 10b. The isolate F7 sequence 
analysis provided a clear testimony that it can be a new strain of Bacillus 
tequilensis. The F7 lipase exhibited optimal activity at 60 °C and pH 9. 
Structural modeling of the F7 lipase revealed that it has a highly conserved 
alpha/beta hydrolase fold at the sequence and structural level except for the 
N-terminal region. Interestingly, residue Glu128 was different from the template 
structure and showed the hydrogen bonding between the side chain of Glu128 and 
side chains of Asn35 and Gln152 amino acids. Besides, this amino acid also 
showed salt bridge interaction between Glu128--Lys101. These interactions may be 
assisting in preserving the stability and activity of lipase at high 
temperatures and in alkaline pH conditions. The information gathered from this 
investigation will guide in the rational designing of new more potential 
extremophilic lipase.

A study of air-borne microbial biodiversity over an isolated scientific research 
station on an ice-shelf in continental Antarctica was undertaken to establish 
the potential source of microbial colonists. The study aimed to assess: (1) 
whether microorganisms were likely to have a local (research station) or distant 
(marine or terrestrial) origin, (2) the effect of changes in sea ice extent on 
microbial biodiversity and (3) the potential human impact on the environment. 
Air samples were taken above Halley Research Station during the austral summer 
and austral winter over a 2-week period. Overall, a low microbial biodiversity 
was detected, which included many sequence replicates. No significant patterns 
were detected in the aerial biodiversity between the austral summer and the 
austral winter. In common with other environmental studies, particularly in the 
polar regions, many of the sequences obtained were from as yet uncultivated 
organisms. Very few marine sequences were detected irrespective of the distance 
to open water, and around one-third of sequences detected were similar to those 
identified in human studies, though both of these might reflect prevailing wind 
conditions. The detected aerial microorganisms were markedly different from 
those obtained in earlier studies over the Antarctic Peninsula in the maritime 
Antarctic.

A thermostable extracellular alkaline protease (called SAPA) was produced 
(4600 U/mL) by Anoxybacillus kamchatkensis M1V, purified to homogeneity, and 
biochemically characterized. SAPA is a monomer with a molecular mass of 28 kDa 
estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
(SDS-PAGE), Native-PAGE, casein-zymography, and size exclusion using high 
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The sequence of its NH2-terminal 
amino-acid residues showed high homology with those of Bacillus proteases. The 
SAPA irreversible inhibition by diiodopropyl fluorophosphates (DFP) and 
phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) confirmed its belonging to the serine 
proteases family. Optimal activity of SAPA was at pH 11 and 70 °C. The sapA gene 
was cloned and expressed in the extracellular fraction of E. coli. The highest 
sequence identity value (95%) of SAPA was obtained with peptidase S8 from 
Bacillus subtilis WT 168, but with 16 amino-acids of difference. The biochemical 
characteristics of the purified recombinant extracellular enzyme (called rSAPA) 
were analogous to those of native SAPA. Interestingly, rSAPA exhibit a degree of 
hydrolysis that were 1.24 and 2.6 than SAPB from Bacillus pumilus CBS and 
subtilisin A from Bacillus licheniformis, respectively. Furthermore, rSAPA 
showed a high detergent compatibility and an outstanding stain removal capacity 
compared to commercial enzymes: savinase™ 16L, type EX and alcalase™ Ultra 2.5 
L.

Traditionally, enzymatic synthesis of nucleoside-5'-monophosphates (5'-NMPs) 
using low water-soluble purine bases has been described as less efficient due to 
their low solubility in aqueous media. The use of enzymes from extremophiles, 
such as thermophiles or alkaliphiles, offers the potential to increase 
solubilisation of these bases by employing high temperatures or alkaline pH. 
This study describes the cloning, expression and purification of 
hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase from Thermus 
thermophilus (TtHGXPRT). Biochemical characterization indicates TtHGXPRT as a 
homotetramer with excellent activity and stability across a broad range of 
temperatures (50-90°C) and ionic strengths (0-500mMNaCl), but it also reveals an 
unusually high activity and stability under alkaline conditions (pH range 8-11). 
In order to explore the potential of TtHGXPRT as an industrial biocatalyst, 
enzymatic production of several dietary 5'-NMPs, such as 5'-GMP and 5'-IMP, was 
carried out at high concentrations of guanine and hypoxanthine.

Deposits of fly ash and other coal combustion wastes are common remnants of the 
energy industry. Despite their environmental risks from heavy metals and trace 
elements, they have been revealed as refuges for threatened terrestrial 
biodiversity. Surprisingly, freshwater biodiversity of fly ash sedimentation 
lagoons remains unknown despite such lack of knowledge strongly limits the 
efficient restoration of fly ash deposits. We bring the first comprehensive 
survey of freshwater biodiversity, including nekton, benthos, zooplankton, 
phytoplankton, and macrophytes, in fly ash lagoons across industrial regions of 
the Czech Republic. To assess their conservation potential, we compared their 
biodiversity with abandoned post-mining ponds, the known strongholds of 
endangered aquatic species in the region with a shortage of natural ponds. Of 28 
recorded threatened species, 15 occurred in the studied fly ash lagoons, some of 
which were less abundant or even absent in the post-mining ponds. These are 
often species of nutrient-poor, fishless waters with rich vegetation, although 
some are specialised extremophiles. Species richness and conservation value of 
most groups in the fly ash lagoons did not significantly differ from the 
post-mining ponds, except for species richness of benthos, zooplankton, and 
macrophytes, which were slightly lower in the fly ash lagoons. Although the 
concentrations of some heavy metals (mainly Se, V, and As) were significantly 
higher in the fly ash lagoons, they did not significantly affect species 
richness or conservation value of the local communities. The differences in 
species composition therefore does not seem to be caused by water chemistry. 
Altogether, we have shown that fly ash lagoons are refuges for threatened 
aquatic species, and we thus suggest maintaining water bodies during site 
restoration after the cessation of fly ash deposition. Based on our analyses of 
environmental variables, we discuss suitable restoration practices that 
efficiently combine biodiversity protection and environmental risk reduction.

DNA was extracted from water and sediment samples taken from soda lakes of the 
Kenyan-Tanzanian Rift Valley. DNA was also extracted from microbial enrichment 
cultures of sediment samples. 16S rRNA genes were amplified by the polymerase 
chain reaction and microbial diversity was studied using denaturing gradient gel 
electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rDNA amplicons. Cloning and sequencing of single 
DGGE bands showed that they usually contained mixed amplicons. Several of the 
amplicon sequences had high identities, up to 99%, with 16S rRNA genes of 
organisms previously isolated from soda lakes, while others were only distantly 
related, with identities as low as 82%. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequenced 
amplicons indicated that sequences were related to the haloarchaeal, 
Bacillus/Clostridium, Rhodobacterium/ Thioalcalovibrio/ Methylobacter, and 
Cytophaga/Flavobacterium/Bacteroides (CFB) groups and the enterobacteria/ 
Aeromonas/Vibrio part of the gamma3 subdivision of the Proteobacteria.

Life in hot environments poses certain constraints on the metabolism of 
thermophilic organisms. Many universal metabolic intermediates are quite labile 
compounds, and without protection will rapidly decompose at elevated 
temperatures. Among these are aminoacyl-tRNAs that are necessarily formed upon 
functioning of the translation apparatus. Aminoacyl-tRNAs are known to be 
hydrolyzed rapidly even at moderate temperatures under mild alkaline conditions. 
We studied the thermal stability of phenylalanyl- and alanyl-tRNA in aqueous 
solutions in order to evaluate a potential threat posed by high temperatures to 
these components of the translation machinery of thermophiles. Specific 
second-order rate constants of the aminoacyl-tRNA hydrolysis reaction were 
determined in the range 20 degrees -80 degrees C. The activation energy of 
phenylalanyl- and alanyl-tRNA hydrolysis was found to be about 42 and 23 kJ/mol, 
respectively. The calculated half-lives of aminoacyl-tRNAs at sub-80 degrees C 
temperatures vary from several seconds to several dozens of seconds at 
near-neutral pH. The possible mechanisms counteracting the observed 
thermolability of aminoacyl-tRNAs in vivo are discussed.

Microbial communities first respond to changes of external environmental 
conditions. Observing the microbial responses to environmental changes in terms 
of taxonomic and functional biodiversity is therefore of great interest, 
particularly in extreme environments, where the already extreme conditions can 
become even harsher. In this study, sediment samples from three different 
shallow hydrothermal vents in Levante Bay (Vulcano Island, Aeolian Islands, 
Italy) were used to set up microcosm experiments with the aim to explore the 
microbial dynamics under changing conditions of pH and redox potential over a 
90-days period. The leading hypothesis was to establish under microcosm 
conditions whether the starting microbial communities of the sediments evolved 
differently depending on their origin. To profile the dynamics of microbial 
populations over time, biodiversity, enzymatic profile, total cell abundance 
estimations, total/respiring cell ratio were estimated by using different 
approaches. An evident change in the microbial community structure was observed, 
mainly in the microcosm containing the sediment from the most acidified site, 
which was characterized by a highly diversified microbial community (in 
prevalence composed of Thermotoga, Desulfobacterota, Planctomycetota, 
Synergistota and Deferribacterota). An increase in microbial resistant forms 
(e.g., spore-forming species) with anaerobic metabolism was detected in all 
experimental conditions. Differential physiological responses characterized the 
sedimentary microbial communities. Proteolytic activity appeared to be 
stimulated under microcosm conditions, whereas the alkaline phosphatase activity 
was significantly depressed at low pH values, like those that were measured at 
the station showing intermediate pH-conditions. The results confirmed a 
differential response of microbial communities depending on the starting 
environmental conditions.

Over 200 years ago Alexander von Humboldt (1808) observed that plant and animal 
diversity peaks at tropical latitudes and decreases toward the poles, a trend he 
attributed to more favorable temperatures in the tropics. Studies to date 
suggest that this temperature-diversity gradient is weak or nonexistent for 
Bacteria and Archaea. To test the impacts of temperature as well as pH on 
bacterial and archaeal diversity, we performed pyrotag sequencing of 16S rRNA 
genes retrieved from 165 soil, sediment and biomat samples of 36 geothermal 
areas in Canada and New Zealand, covering a temperature range of 7.5-99 °C and a 
pH range of 1.8-9.0. This represents the widest ranges of temperature and pH yet 
examined in a single microbial diversity study. Species richness and diversity 
indices were strongly correlated to temperature, with R(2) values up to 0.62 for 
neutral-alkaline springs. The distributions were unimodal, with peak diversity 
at 24 °C and decreasing diversity at higher and lower temperature extremes. 
There was also a significant pH effect on diversity; however, in contrast to 
previous studies of soil microbial diversity, pH explained less of the 
variability (13-20%) than temperature in the geothermal samples. No correlation 
was observed between diversity values and latitude from the equator, and we 
therefore infer a direct temperature effect in our data set. These results 
demonstrate that temperature exerts a strong control on microbial diversity when 
considered over most of the temperature range within which life is possible.

Six genes encoding high-molecular-mass subtilisins (HMSs) of alkaliphilic 
Bacillus spp. were cloned and sequenced. Their open reading frames of 
2,394-2,424 bp encoded prosubtilisins of 798-808 amino acids (aa) consisting of 
the prepropeptides of 151-158 aa and the mature enzymes of 640-656 aa. The 
deduced aa sequences of the mature enzymes exhibited 60-95% identity to those of 
FT protease of Bacillus sp. strain KSM-KP43, a subtilisin-like serine protease, 
and a minor serine protease, Vpr, of Bacillus strains. Three of the six 
recombinant enzymes were susceptible to proteolysis, but the others were 
autodigestion resistant. All enzymes had optimal pH values of 10.5-11.0, optimal 
temperatures of 40-45 degrees C for hydrolysis of a synthetic substrate, and 
were heat labile. These alkaline proteases seem to form a new subtilisin family, 
as judged by their aa sequences and phylogenetic analysis.

Saline soda lakes are of immense ecological value as they niche some of the most 
exclusive haloalkaliphilic communities dominated by bacterial and archaeal 
domains, with few eukaryotic algal representatives. A handful reports describe 
Picocystis as a key primary producer with great production rates in extremely 
saline alkaline habitats. An extremely haloalkaliphilic picoalgal strain, 
Picocystis salinarum SLJS6 isolated from hypersaline soda lake Sambhar, 
Rajasthan, India, grew robustly in an enriched soda lake medium containing 
mainly Na2CO3, 50 g/l; NaHCO3, 50 g/l, NaCl, 50 g/l (salinity ≈150‰) at pH 10. 
To elucidate the molecular basis of such adaptation to high inorganic carbon and 
NaCl concentrations, a high-throughput label-free quantitation based 
quantitative proteomics approach was applied. Out of the total 383 proteins 
identified in treated samples, 225 were differentially abundant proteins (DAPs), 
of which 150 were statistically significant (p < 0.05) including 70 upregulated 
and 64 downregulated proteins after 3 days of growth in highly saline-alkaline 
medium. Most DAPs were involved in photosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, 
glucose metabolism and ribosomal structural components envisaging that 
photosynthesis and ATP synthesis were central to the salinity-alkalinity 
response. Key components of photosynthetic machinery like photosystem reaction 
centres, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase ATP, Rubisco, 
Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase were highly 
upregulated. Enzymes peptidylprolyl isomerases (PPIase), important for correct 
protein folding showed remarkable marked-up regulation along with other chaperon 
proteins indicating their role in osmotic adaptation. Enhanced photosynthetic 
activity exhibited by P. salinarum in highly saline-alkaline condition is 
noteworthy as photosynthesis is suppressed under hyperosmotic conditions in most 
photosynthetic organisms. The study provided the first insights into the 
proteome of extremophilic alga P. salinarum exhibiting extraordinary osmotic 
adaptation and proliferation in polyextreme conditions prevailing in saline 
sodic ecosystems, potentially unraveling the basis of resilience in this not so 
known organism and paves the way for a promising future candidate for 
biotechnological applications and model organism for deciphering the molecular 
mechanisms of osmotic adaptation. The mass spectrometry proteomics data is 
available at the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository 
with the dataset identifier PXD037170.

Soda lakes are salt lakes with a naturally alkaline pH due to evaporative 
concentration of sodium carbonates in the absence of major divalent cations. 
Hypersaline soda brines harbor microbial communities with a high species- and 
strain-level archaeal diversity and a large proportion of still uncultured 
poly-extremophiles compared to neutral brines of similar salinities. We present 
the first ""metagenomic snapshots"" of microbial communities thriving in the 
brines of four shallow soda lakes from the Kulunda Steppe (Altai, Russia) 
covering a salinity range from 170 to 400 g/L. Both amplicon sequencing of 16S 
rRNA fragments and direct metagenomic sequencing showed that the top-level taxa 
abundance was linked to the ambient salinity: Bacteroidetes, Alpha-, and 
Gamma-proteobacteria were dominant below a salinity of 250 g/L, Euryarchaeota at 
higher salinities. Within these taxa, amplicon sequences related to Halorubrum, 
Natrinema, Gracilimonas, purple non-sulfur bacteria (Rhizobiales, Rhodobacter, 
and Rhodobaca) and chemolithotrophic sulfur oxidizers (Thioalkalivibrio) were 
highly abundant. Twenty-four draft population genomes from novel members and 
ecotypes within the Nanohaloarchaea, Halobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were 
reconstructed to explore their metabolic features, environmental abundance and 
strategies for osmotic adaptation. The Halobacteria- and Bacteroidetes-related 
draft genomes belong to putative aerobic heterotrophs, likely with the capacity 
to ferment sugars in the absence of oxygen. Members from both taxonomic groups 
are likely involved in primary organic carbon degradation, since some of the 
reconstructed genomes encode the ability to hydrolyze recalcitrant substrates, 
such as cellulose and chitin. Putative sodium-pumping rhodopsins were found in 
both a Flavobacteriaceae- and a Chitinophagaceae-related draft genome. The 
predicted proteomes of both the latter and a Rhodothermaceae-related draft 
genome were indicative of a ""salt-in"" strategy of osmotic adaptation. The 
primary catabolic and respiratory pathways shared among all available reference 
genomes of Nanohaloarchaea and our novel genome reconstructions remain 
incomplete, but point to a primarily fermentative lifestyle. Encoded 
xenorhodopsins found in most drafts suggest that light plays an important role 
in the ecology of Nanohaloarchaea. Putative encoded halolysins and laccase-like 
oxidases might indicate the potential for extracellular degradation of proteins 
and peptides, and phenolic or aromatic compounds.

BACKGROUND: Carbon nanotubes have been shown to improve the germination and 
growth of some plant species, extending the applicability of the emerging 
nano-biotechnology field to crop science.
RESULTS: In this work, exploitation of commercial multiwalled carbon nanotubes 
(MWCNTs) in control and 100 mM NaCl-treated broccoli was performed. Transmission 
electron microscopy demonstrated that MWCNTs can enter the cells in adult plants 
with higher accumulation under salt stress. Positive effect of MWCNTs on growth 
in NaCl-treated plants was consequence of increased water uptake, promoted by 
more-favourable energetic forces driving this process, and enhanced net 
assimilation of CO2. MWCNTs induced changes in the lipid composition, rigidity 
and permeability of the root plasma membranes relative to salt-stressed plants. 
Also, enhanced aquaporin transduction occurred, which improved water uptake and 
transport, alleviating the negative effects of salt stress.
CONCLUSION: Our work provides new evidences about the effect of MWCNTs on plasma 
membrane properties of the plant cell. The positive response to MWCNTs in 
broccoli plants opens novel perspectives for their technological uses in new 
agricultural practices, especially when 1plants are exposed to saline 
environments.

Heavy metals are toxic compounds known to cause multiple and severe cellular 
damage. However, acidophilic extremophiles are able to cope with very high 
concentrations of heavy metals. This study investigated the stress response 
under natural environmental heavy metal concentrations in an acidophilic 
Dunaliella acidophila. We employed Illumina sequencing for a de novo 
transcriptome assembly and to identify changes in response to high cadmium 
concentrations and natural metal-rich water. The photosynthetic performance was 
also estimated by pulse amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorescence. Transcriptomic 
analysis highlights a number of processes mainly related to a high constitutive 
expression of genes involved in oxidative stress and response to reactive oxygen 
species (ROS), even in the absence of heavy metals. Photosynthetic activity 
seems to be unaltered under short-term exposition to Cd and chronic exposure to 
natural metal-rich water, probably due to an increase in the synthesis of 
structural photosynthetic components preserving their functional integrity. An 
overrepresentation of Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to metabolic activities, 
transcription, and proteosomal catabolic process was observed when D. acidophila 
grew under chronic exposure to natural metal-rich water. GO terms involved in 
carbohydrate metabolic process, reticulum endoplasmic and Golgi bodies, were 
also specifically overrepresented in natural metal-rich water library suggesting 
an endoplasmic reticulum stress response.

Anaerobic enrichment cultures with elemental sulfur as electron acceptor and 
either acetate or propionate as electron donor and carbon source at pH 10 and 
moderate salinity inoculated with sediments from soda lakes in Kulunda Steppe 
(Altai, Russia) resulted in the isolation of two novel members of the bacterial 
phylum Chrysiogenetes. The isolates, AHT11 and AHT19, represent the first 
specialized obligate anaerobic dissimilatory sulfur respirers from soda lakes. 
They use either elemental sulfur/polysulfide or arsenate as electron acceptor 
and a few simple organic compounds as electron donor and carbon source. 
Elemental sulfur is reduced to sulfide through intermediate polysulfide, while 
arsenate is reduced to arsenite. The bacteria belong to the obligate 
haloalkaliphiles, with a pH growth optimum from 10 to 10.2 and a salt range from 
0.2 to 3.0 M Na(+) (optimum 0.4-0.6 M). According to the phylogenetic analysis, 
the two strains were close to each other, but distinct from the nearest 
relative, the haloalkaliphilic sulfur-reducing bacterium Desulfurispirillum 
alkaliphilum, which was isolated from a bioreactor. On the basis of distinct 
phenotype and phylogeny, the soda lake isolates are proposed as a new genus and 
species, Desulfurispira natronophila (type strain AHT11(T) = DSM22071(T) = 
UNIQEM U758(T)).

Small heat shock proteins (HSPs), such as HSP20, represent cellular thermal 
resistance mechanisms, to avoid protein aggregation at elevated temperatures. 
Recombinantly expressed HSP20s serve as a molecular tool for improving the 
tolerance of living cells to various physical and chemical stressors. Here, we 
aimed to heterologously express 18 HSP20s from 12 thermotolerant bacteria in 
Escherichia coli and evaluate their effects on various physical and chemical 
cellular stresses. Seventeen HSP20s were successfully expressed as soluble 
proteins. Recombinant E. coli cells were subjected to heat, cold, acidic, 
alkaline, and hyperosmolar stress to evaluate the effects of HSP20 proteins on 
stress resistance. Notably, the overexpression of 15 HSP20s enhanced the stress 
resistance of E. coli compared to that of the control strain. In particular, 
HSPs from Tepidimonas sediminis and Oceanithermus profundus improved the stress 
tolerance of E. coli under all tested conditions. In addition, E. coli harboring 
HSP20 from T. sediminis retained cell viability even after heat treatment at 
52 °C for 5 days. To our knowledge, this is the first report of E. coli 
tolerance to prolonged (> 100 h) high-temperature stress. These findings 
indicate the potential of thermotolerant HSPs as molecular tools for improving 
stress tolerance in E. coli.

The extremophyte Eutrema salsugineum (Yukon ecotype) has adapted to an 
environment low in available phosphate through metabolic and root-associated 
traits that enables it to efficiently retrieve, use, and recycle phosphorus. 
Efficient phosphate (Pi) use by plants would increase crop productivity under 
Pi-limiting conditions and reduce our reliance on Pi applied as fertilizer. An 
ecotype of Eutrema salsugineum originating from the Yukon, Canada, shows no 
evidence of decreased relative growth rate or biomass under low Pi conditions 
and, as such, offers a promising model for identifying mechanisms to improve Pi 
use by crops. We evaluated traits associated with efficient Pi use by Eutrema 
(Yukon ecotype) seedlings and 4-week-old plants, including acquisition, 
remobilization, and the operation of metabolic bypasses. Relative to 
Arabidopsis, Eutrema was slower to remobilize phosphorus (P) from senescing 
leaves, primary and lateral roots showed a lower capacity for rhizosphere 
acidification, and root acid phosphatase activity was more broadly distributed 
and not Pi responsive. Both species produced long root hairs on low Pi media, 
whereas Arabidopsis root hairs were well endowed with phosphatase activity. This 
capacity was largely absent in Eutrema. In contrast to Arabidopsis, maximal in 
vitro rates of pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase and 
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activities were not responsive to low Pi 
conditions suggesting that Eutrema has a constitutive and likely preferential 
capacity to use glycolytic bypass enzymes. Rhizosphere acidification, exudation 
of acid phosphatases, and rapid remobilization of leaf P are unlikely strategies 
used by Eutrema for coping with low Pi. Rather, equipping an entire root system 
for Pi acquisition and utilizing a metabolic strategy suited to deficient Pi 
conditions offer better explanations for how Eutrema has adapted to thrive on 
alkaline, highly saline soil that is naturally low in available Pi.

The remodelling of membrane lipids contributes to the tolerance of plants to 
stresses, such as freezing and deprivation of phosphorus. However, whether and 
how this remodelling relates to tolerance of PEG-induced osmotic stress has 
seldom been reported. Thellungiella salsuginea is a popular extremophile model 
for studies of stress tolerance. In this study, it was demonstrated that T. 
salsuginea was more tolerant to PEG-induced osmotic stress than its close 
relative Arabidopsis thaliana. Lipidomic analysis indicated that plastidic 
lipids are more sensitive to PEG-induced osmotic stress than extra-plastidic 
ones in both species, and that the changes in plastidic lipids differed markedly 
between them. PEG-induced osmotic stress led to a dramatic decrease in levels of 
plastidic lipids in A. thaliana, whereas the change in plastidic lipid in T. 
salsuginea involved an adaptive remodelling shortly after the onset of 
PEG-induced osmotic stress. The two aspects of this remodelling involved 
increases in (1) the level of plastidic lipids, especially digalactosyl 
diacylglycerol, and (2) the double bond index of plastidic lipids. These 
remodelling steps could maintain the integrity and improve the fluidity of 
plastidic membranes and this may contribute to the PEG-induced osmotic stress 
tolerance of T. salsuginea.

The diversity of archaea and bacteria was investigated in two slightly alkaline, 
mesophilic hot springs from the Western Plain of Romania. Phylogenetic analysis 
showed a low diversity of Archaea, only three Euryarchaeota taxa being detected: 
Methanomethylovorans thermophila, Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis and 
Methanococcus aeolicus. Twelve major bacterial groups were identified, both 
springs being dominated by Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria. While 
at the phylum/class-level the microbial mats share a similar biodiversity; at 
the species level the geothermal springs investigated seem to be colonized by 
specific consortia. The dominant taxa were filamentous heterocyst-containing 
Fischerella, at 45 °C and non-heterocyst Leptolyngbya and Geitlerinema, at 55 
°C. Other bacterial taxa (Thauera sp., Methyloversatilis universalis, 
Pannonibacter phragmitetus, Polymorphum gilvum, Metallibacterium sp. and 
Spartobacteria) were observed for the first time in association with a 
geothermal habitat. Based on their bacterial diversity the two mats were 
clustered together with other similar habitats from Europe and part of Asia, 
most likely the water temperature playing a major role in the formation of 
specific microbial communities that colonize the investigated thermal springs.

New alkaliphilic Bacillus producers of cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase, 
EC 2.4.1.19) were isolated from 17 Bulgarian alkaline and normal habitats 
(springs and soils) by three steps of a selection. None of the isolates 
obtained, producing CGTase, appeared to be thermophilic in character. One 
hundred and thirty-seven strains were estimated for CGTase activity by batch 
cultivation in a liquid alkaline medium. Twenty-seven of them had a detectable 
CGTase activity in their culture supernatants under the enzyme assay conditions, 
despite of the significant growth of all isolates. The phenotypic properties of 
three selected strains (20RF, 8SB and 24WE) were determined. They were aerobic 
endospore-forming Bacillus strains: two of them were obligated alkaliphiles 
(20RF and 8SB) and one, alkalitolerant (24WE). Both obligated alkaliphiles were 
further characterised by 16S rRNA analysis. According to the full 16S rRNA gene 
sequences obtained and deposited to the NCBI GenBank database, both isolated 
obligated alkaliphiles 20RF and 8SB were clustered into the group of 
alkaliphilic Bacillus species. The exhibited CGTase production by them (230-250 
U ml(-1) for 20RF and 130-160 U ml(-1) for 8SB) defined these new isolates as 
promising producers of the enzyme, especially Bacillus sp. 8SB synthesising 
thermostable alkaline beta-CGTase. Both new enzymes from 20RF and 8SB Bacillus 
strains formed only two types of cyclodextrins, beta and gamma, which could be 
of interest for their easy separation and industrial production.

Rehabilitation of heavy metals contaminated soils using association between 
legumes and beneficial rhizospheric microorganisms such as plant 
growth-promoting bacteria (PGPR) is a major challenge in agronomy. The present 
study focuses on assessing the impact of field inoculation with I1 (Rhizobium 
leguminosarum (M5) + Bacillus simplex + Luteibacter sp. + Variovorax sp.) and I5 
(R. leguminosarum (M5) + Pseudomonas fluorescens (K23) + Luteibacter 
sp. + Variovorax sp.) on growth and phytoremediation potential of Lathyrus 
sativus plants as well as soil quality and fertility. The experimentation was 
carried out in mine tailings of northern Tunisia. Obtained Results indicated 
that the in situ inoculation with I1 and I5 significantly increased the shoots 
(47% and 22%) and roots dry weights (22% and 29%), as well as nodules number 
(48% and 31%), respectively, compared to uninoculated plants. The maximum Pb 
accumulation in the above-ground tissue was recorded in plants inoculated with 
I5 (1180.85 mg kg-1 DW). At the same time, we noticed a reduction in total Pb 
and Cd in the rhizosphere of inoculated plots mainly in those inoculated with I5 
reaching 46% and 61%, respectively, compared to uninoculated plots. Likewise, I5 
inoculum significantly enhanced soil total nitrogen (35%) and available 
phosphorus (100%), as well as β-glucosidase (16%), urease (32%) and alkaline 
phosphatase (12%) activities. Here we demonstrate the usefulness of L. sativus 
inoculated with I5 inoculum formed by mixing efficient and heavy metals 
resistant PGPR to boost an efficient reclamation of Cd and Pb contaminated soils 
and, ultimately, to improve their quality and fertility.

AaNhaD, a gene isolated from the soda lake alkaliphile Alkalimonas amylolytica, 
encodes a Na(+) /H(+) antiporter crucial for the bacterium's resistance to 
salt/alkali stresses. However, it remains unknown whether this type of bacterial 
gene may be able to increase the tolerance of flowering plants to salt/alkali 
stresses. To investigate the use of extremophile genetic resources in higher 
plants, transgenic tobacco BY-2 cells and plants harboring AaNhaD were generated 
and their stress tolerance was evaluated. Ectopic expression of AaNhaD enhanced 
the salt tolerance of the transgenic BY-2 cells in a pH-dependent manner. 
Compared to wild-type controls, the transgenic cells exhibited increased Na(+) 
concentrations and pH levels in the vacuoles. Subcellular localization analysis 
indicated that AaNhaD-GFP fusion proteins were primarily localized in the 
tonoplasts. Similar to the transgenic BY-2 cells, AaNhaD-overexpressing tobacco 
plants displayed enhanced stress tolerance when grown in saline-alkali soil. 
These results indicate that AaNhaD functions as a pH-dependent tonoplast Na(+) 
/H(+) antiporter in plant cells, thus presenting a new avenue for the genetic 
improvement of salinity/alkalinity tolerance.

Lichens are successful colonizers in extreme environments worldwide, and they 
are considered to have played an important role during the evolution of life. 
Here, we have used a correlative approach, combining three optical signals 
(chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF), reflectance, and Raman spectra), to monitor 
hydration induced changes in photosynthetic properties of an Antarctic 
chlorolichen Dermatocarpon polyphyllizum. We measured these three signals from 
this lichen at different stages (after 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h) of hydration, and 
compared the data obtained from this lichen in ""dry state"" as well as in 
different ""hydrated state"". We found that dry state of this lichen has: (1) no 
variable ChlF, (2) high reflectance, with no red-edge and almost zero 
photochemical reflectance index (PRI), and (3) low-intensity Raman bands of 
their carotenoids. Furthermore, 4 h of hydration, increased its relative water 
content (RWC) by 93%, showed red-edge in reflectance spectra, and changed the 
maximum quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm) from 0 to 0.57 ± 0.01. We 
found that reflectance indices, normalized difference index (NDVI) and PRI, 
significantly differed between brown and black/green surface areas, at all 
hydration stages; whereas, a shift in the Raman ν1(CC) band, between brown and 
black/green surface areas, occurred in 24 h or 48 h hydrated samples. These data 
indicate that hydration shortly (within 4 h) activated functions of 
photosynthetic apparatus, and the de novo synthesis of carotenoids occured in 
24 h or 48 h. Furthermore, exposure to high irradiance 
(2000 μmol photons m-2 s-1), in 48 h hydrated lichen, significantly reduced 
Fv/Fm (signifies photoinhibition) and increased PRI (represents changes in 
xanthophyll pigments). We conclude that the implication of such a correlative 
approach is highly useful for understanding survival and protective mechanisms 
on extremophile photosynthetic organisms.

The ability of Halomonas maura to bioprecipitate carbonate and sulphate crystals 
in solid media at different manganese concentrations has been demonstrated in 
this study for the first time. The precipitated minerals were studied by X-ray 
diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and 
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The precipitated minerals were different 
based on the manganese concentration present in the medium and the incubation 
time. In the absence of manganese, H. maura formed pseudokutnahorite crystals; 
in the presence of manganese, the concentration in the culture medium determined 
the precipitation carbonates, such as rhodochrosite and dolomites. However, in 
the presence of low concentrations of manganese chloride (MnCl2) (5 g/l), 
kutnohorite crystals were also formed. Finally, when H. maura was grown in the 
presence of manganese, small amounts of sulphate crystals (such as bassanite and 
gypsum) were detected. Our study of the precipitated minerals showed an active 
role of H. maura in the biomineralisation process, but the geochemical 
conditions, and the manganese concentrations in particular, were clearly 
influential.

In a halotolerant fungus Aspergillus glaucus CCHA, several functional proteins 
with stress-tolerant activity have been studied, but no secretory enzymes have 
been identified yet. The unique GH5 cellulase candidate from A. glaucus, an 
endoglucanase termed as AgCMCase, was cloned, expressed in the Pichia pastoris 
system and the purified enzyme was characterized. A large amount of recombinant 
enzyme secreted by the P. pastoris GS115 strain was purified to homogeneity. The 
molecular weight of the purified endoglucanase is about 55.0 kDa. The AgCMCase 
exhibited optimum catalytic activity at pH 5.0 and 55 °C. However, it remained 
relatively stable at temperatures ranging from 45 to 80 °C and pH ranging from 
4.0 to 9.0. In addition, it showed higher activity at extreme NaCl 
concentrations from 1.0 to 4.0 M, suggesting it is an enzyme highly stable under 
heat, acid, alkaline and saline conditions. To evaluate the catalytic activity 
of AgCMCase, the hydrolysis products of rice and corn straws were successfully 
studied. In conclusion, the AgCMCase is a thermostable and salt-tolerant 
cellulase with potential for industrial application.

The present study describes the synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) 
using an extremophilic actinobacterial cell-free extract, supplied with aqueous 
zinc acetate solution. Crystalline nature, morphological features, and 
polydispersed nanoparticles size (15-30 nm) were identified by X-ray diffraction 
(XRD), atomic force and electron microscopic analysis with dynamic light 
scattering (DLS) study. The interaction between biomolecules and ZnO-NPs was 
analyzed using Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR). Furthermore 
antibacterial, antioxidant activities, and cell viability test of ZnO-NPs were 
systematically evaluated. The present study opens a new avenue for the 
actinobacterial synthesis of oxide nanoparticles.

Enzymes isolated from thermophilic organisms found in oil reservoirs can find 
applications in many fields, including the oleochemical, pharmaceutical, 
bioenergy, and food/dairy industries. In this study, in silico identification 
and recombinant production of an esterase from the extremophile bacteria 
Petrotoga mobilis (designated PmEst) were performed. Then biochemical, 
bioinformatics and structural characterizations were undertaken using a 
combination of synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) and fluorescence 
spectroscopies to correlate PmEst stability and hydrolytic activity on different 
substrates. The enzyme presented a high Michaelis-Menten constant (KM 0.16 mM) 
and optimum activity at ~55°C for p-nitrophenyl butyrate. The secondary 
structure of PmEst was preserved at acid pH, but not under alkaline conditions. 
PmEst was unfolded at high concentrations of urea or guanidine through 
apparently different mechanisms. The esterase activity of PmEst was preserved in 
the presence of ethanol or propanol and its melting temperature increased ~8°C 
in the presence of these organic solvents. PmEst is a mesophilic esterase with 
substrate preference towards short-to medium-length acyl chains. The SRCD data 
of PmEst is in agreement with the prediction of an α/β protein, which leads us 
to assume that it displays a typical fold of esterases from this family. The 
increased enzyme stability in organic solvents may enable novel applications for 
its use in synthetic biology. Taken together, our results demonstrate features 
of the PmEst enzyme that indicate it may be suitable for applications in 
industrial processes, particularly, when the use of polar organic solvents is 
required.

The present study investigates the purification and biochemical characterization 
of a novel extracellular serine alkaline protease, subtilisin (called SAPN) from 
Melghiribacillus thermohalophilus Nari2AT. The highest yield of protease 
(395 IU/g) with white shrimp shell by-product (40 g/L) as a unique source of 
nutriments in the growth medium was achieved after 52 h at 55 °C. The monomeric 
enzyme of about 30 kDa was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate 
fractionation, heat treatment, followed by sequential column chromatographies. 
The optimum pH and temperature values for subtilisin activity were pH 10 and 
75 °C, respectively, and half lives of 9 and 5 h at 80 and 90 °C, respectively. 
The sequence of the 25 NH2-terminal residues pertaining of SAPN exhibited a high 
homology with those of Bacillus subtilisins. The inhibition by DFP and PMSF 
indicates that this enzyme belongs to the serine proteases family. SAPN was 
found to be effective in the deproteinization (DDP %) of blue swimming crab 
(Portunus segnis) and white shrimp (Metapenaeus monoceros) by-products, with a 
degree of 65 and 82%, respectively. The commercial and the two chitins obtained 
in this work showed a similar peak pattern in Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) 
analysis, suggesting that SAPN is suitable for the bio-production of chitin from 
shell by-products.

Switching an anti-IgG binding site between archaeal extremophilic proteins 
results in Affitins with enhanced pH stability.

Béhar G, Pacheco S, Maillasson M, Mouratou B, Pecorari F.

As a useful reagent for biotechnological applications, a scaffold protein needs 
to be as stable as possible to ensure longer lifetimes. We have developed 
archaeal extremophilic proteins from the “7 kDa DNA-binding” family as scaffolds 
to derive affinity proteins (Affitins). In this study, we evaluated a rational 
structure/sequence-guided approach to stabilize an Affitin derived from Sac7d by 
transferring its human IgG binding site onto the framework of the more thermally 
stable Sso7d homolog. The chimera obtained was functional, well expressed in 
Escherichia coli, but less thermally stable than the original Affitin (T(m) = 
74.2 °C vs. T(m) = 80.4 °C). Two single mutations described as thermally 
stabilizing wild type Sso7d were introduced into chimeras. Only the double 
mutation nearly restored thermal stability (T(m) = 76.9 °C). Interestingly, the 
chimera and its double mutant were stable from pH 0 up to at least pH 13. Our 
results show that it is possible to increase further the stability of Affitins 
toward alkaline conditions (+2 pH units) while conserving their advantageous 
properties. As Affitins are based on a growing family of homologs from archaeal 
extremophiles, we conclude that this approach offers new potential for their 
improvement, which will be useful in demanding biotechnological applications.

A total of 12 samples were collected from the Tengchong geothermal areas of 
Yunnan, China, with the goal to assess the arsenite (AsIII) oxidation potential 
of the extant microbial communities as inferred by the abundance and diversity 
of the AsIII oxidase large subunit gene aioA relative to geochemical context. 
Arsenic concentrations were higher (on average 251.68 μg/L) in neutral or 
alkaline springs than in acidic springs (on average 30.88 μg/L). aioA abundance 
ranged from 1.63 × 10(1) to 7.08 × 10(3) per ng of DNA and positively correlated 
with sulfide and the ratios of arsenate (AsV):total dissolved arsenic (AsTot). 
Based on qPCR estimates of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene abundance, 
aioA-harboring organisms comprised as much as ~15% of the total community. 
Phylogenetically, the major aioA sequences (270 total) in the acidic hot springs 
(pH 3.3-4.4) were affiliated with Aquificales and Rhizobiales, while those in 
neutral or alkaline springs (pH 6.6-9.1) were inferred to be primarily bacteria 
related to Thermales and Burkholderiales. Interestingly, aioA abundance at one 
site greatly exceeded bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundance, suggesting these aioA 
genes were archaeal even though phylogenetically these aioA sequences were most 
similar to the Aquificales. In summary, this study described novel aioA 
sequences in geothermal features geographically far removed from those in the 
heavily studied Yellowstone geothermal complex.

The study of the yeasts that inhabit cold environments, such as Antarctica, is 
an active field of investigation oriented toward understanding their ecological 
roles in these ecosystems. In a great part, the interest in cold-adapted yeasts 
is due to several industrial and biotechnological applications that have been 
described for them. The aim of this work was to isolate and identify yeasts from 
sedimentary rock samples collected at the Union Glacier, Antarctica. 
Furthermore, the yeasts were physiologically characterized, including the 
production of metabolites of biotechnological interest. The yeasts isolated that 
were identified at the molecular level belonged to genera Collophora (1 
isolate), Cryptococcus (2 isolates), Sporidiobolus (4 isolates), Sporobolomyces 
(1 isolate) and Torrubiella (2 isolates). The majority of yeasts were 
basidiomycetous and psychrotolerant. By cross-test assays for anti-yeast 
activity, it was determined that Collophora sp., Sporidiobolus salmonicolor, and 
Sporobolomyces roseus secreted a protein factor that kills Sporidiobolus 
metaroseus. The colored yeasts Sp. salmonicolor, Sp. metaroseus and Collophora 
sp. produced several carotenoid pigments that were identified as 2,3 
dihydroxy-γ-carotene, -carotene, 4-ketotorulene, torulene β-cryptoxanthin and 
spirilloxanthin. Concerning analysis of mycosporines, these metabolites were 
only found in the yeasts Torrubiella sp. and Cryptococcus sp. T11-10-1. 
Furthermore, the yeasts were evaluated for the production of extracellular 
hydrolytic activities. Of the twelve activities analyzed, alkaline phosphatase, 
invertase, gelatinase, cellulase, amylase, and protease enzyme activities were 
detected. The yeasts Cryptococcus sp. T11-10-1 and Sporidiobolus metaroseus 
showed the highest number of different enzyme activities.

Deep sequencing of prokaryotic 16S rDNA regularly reveals thousands of microbial 
species thriving in many common habitats. It is still unknown how this huge 
microbial diversity, including many potentially competing organisms, may persist 
at a single site. One of plausible hypotheses is that a large number of 
spatially separated microcommunities exist within each complex habitat. Smaller 
subset of the species may exist in each microcommunity and actually interact 
with each other. We sampled two groups of microbial stalactites growing at a 
single acidic mine drainage outlet as a model of multiplicated, low-complexity 
microhabitat. Samples from six other sites were added for comparison. Both tRFLP 
and 16S rDNA pyrosequencing showed that microbial communities containing 6 to 51 
species-level operational taxonomic units (OTU) inhabited all stalactites. 
Interestingly, most OTUs including the highly abundant ones unpredictably 
alternated regardless of physical and environmental distance of the stalactites. 
As a result, the communities clustered independently on sample site and other 
variables when using both phylogenetic dissimilarity and OTU abundance metrics. 
Interestingly, artificial communities generated by pooling the biota of several 
adjacent stalactites together clustered by the locality more strongly than when 
the stalactites were analyzed separately. The most probable interpretation is 
that each stalactite contains likely random selection from the pool of plausible 
species. Such degree of stochasticity in assembly of extremophilic microbial 
communities is significantly greater than commonly proposed and requires caution 
when interpreting microbial diversity.

Berkeley Pit Lake is an abandoned open-pit copper mine filled with 30 billion 
gallons of acidic, metal-contaminated water. This harsh environment is proving 
to be a source of unusual microorganisms that produce novel bioactive 
metabolites. Bioassay-guided fractionation using signal transduction enzyme 
assays led to the isolation of the novel spiroketal, berkelic acid 1, and of the 
known gamma-pyrone, spiciferone A 4. Berkelic acid has shown selective, 
nanomolar activity against OVCAR-3, an ovarian cancer cell line in the National 
Cancer Institute cell line screen. The isolation and characterization of these 
compounds are reported here.

Here we describe a new, extremely thermophilic amoeba growing between 33 degrees 
C and 57 degrees C ( Topt.=50 degrees C). Isolates had been obtained from hot 
springs at Agnano Terme (Italy), Yellowstone National Park (USA), Kamchatka 
(Russia), and the Arenal Volcano (Costa Rica). They could be cultured 
monoxenically on a thermophilic alpha-proteobacterium. The morphology of the 
amoeba was studied using a microscope situated under a heatable polyacrylate 
hood. At 50 degrees C, the cells appeared flat with an irregular triangular or 
elongate shape, sometimes exhibiting fine spine-like subpseudopodia. On average, 
they were 22 microm long and 11 microm wide and had one nucleus with a central 
nucleolus. Based on morphology and on SSU rRNA comparisons, the amoeba belonged 
to the genus Echinamoeba, where it represents a new species. Referring to its 
extremely thermophilic lifestyle and its hydrothermal habitat, we name it E. 
thermarum.

Alkaliphilic Nocardiopsis sp. strain F96 produced three beta-1,3-glucanase 
isozymes of different molecular masses (BglF1, BglF2 and BglF3). The N-terminal 
amino acid sequences of BglFs indicated that these isozymes were the products of 
a single gene. The beta-1,3-glucanase gene (bglF) was cloned from the 
chromosomal DNA of strain F96. The bglF gene encoded a polypeptide of 270 amino 
acids including a signal sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence of mature 
BglF exhibited the highest homology to those of glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 
16 beta-1,3-glucanases, suggesting that the enzyme belonged to the GH family 16. 
The mature region of bglF gene was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli. 
The optimum pH and temperature of purified recombinant BglF were pH 9.0 and 70 
degrees C, respectively. This enzyme efficiently hydrolyzed insoluble 
beta-1,3-glucans and showed the highest activity toward a beta-1,3-1,4-glucan 
rather than beta-1,3-glucans. These results suggested that BglF would be a novel 
beta-1,3-glucanse. Mutational analysis revealed that Glu123 and Glu128 should be 
the catalytic residues of BglF.

Natranaerobius thermophilus is an unusual anaerobic extremophile, it is 
halophilic and alkalithermophilic; growing optimally at 3.3-3.9M Na(+), pH(50°C) 
9.5 and 53°C. The ATPase of N. thermophilus was characterized at the biochemical 
level to ascertain its role in life under hypersaline, alkaline, thermal 
conditions. The partially purified enzyme (10-fold purification) displayed the 
typical subunit pattern for F-type ATPases, with a 5-subunit F(1) portion and 
3-subunit-F(O) portion. ATP hydrolysis by the purified ATPase was stimulated 
almost 4-fold by low concentrations of Na(+) (5mM); hydrolysis activity was 
inhibited by higher Na(+) concentrations. Partially purified ATPase was 
alkaliphilic and thermophilic, showing maximal hydrolysis at 47°C and the 
alkaline pH(50°C) of 9.3. ATP hydrolysis was sensitive to the F-type ATPase 
inhibitor N,N'-dicylohexylcarbodiimide and exhibited inhibition by both free 
Mg(2+) and free ATP. ATP synthesis by inverted membrane vesicles proceeded 
slowly and was driven by a Na(+)-ion gradient that was sensitive to the 
Na(+)-ionophore monensin. Analysis of the atp operon showed the presence of the 
Na(+)-binding motif in the c subunit (Q(33), E(66), T(67), T(68), Y(71)), and a 
complete, untruncated ε subunit; suggesting that ATP hydrolysis by the enzyme is 
regulated. Based on these properties, the F(1)F(O)-ATPase of N. thermophilus is 
a Na(+)-translocating ATPase used primarily for expelling cytoplasmic Na(+) that 
accumulates inside cells of N. thermophilus during alkaline stress. In support 
of this theory are the presence of the c subunit Na(+)-binding motif and the low 
rates of ATP synthesis observed. The complete ε subunit is hypothesized to 
control excessive ATP hydrolysis and preserve intracellular Na(+) needed by 
electrogenic cation/proton antiporters crucial for cytoplasmic acidification in 
the obligately alkaliphilic N. thermophilus.

Atriplex halimus is a xerohalophyte plant, which could be used as cash crops. 
This plant was integrated in Tunisian government programs the aim of which is to 
rehabilitate saline areas and desert. To investigate its strategies involved in 
salt tolerance, A. halimus was grown hydroponically under controlled conditions 
with increasing salinity. Plants were harvested and analyzed after 60 days of 
treatment. The biomass of A. halimus increased by moderate salinity and 
decreased significantly at high salinity compared to control plants at 400 mM. 
Despite of the large amounts of Na(+) observed in the leaves of Atriplex plants, 
leaf water contents and leaf succulence kept on increasing in treated plants and 
decreased over 150 mM NaCl. This confirmed the compartmentation and the 
efficient contribution of Na(+) in the osmotic adjustment. Analysis of the 
metabolic profiles showed an accumulation of carbohydrates and amino acids. The 
leaf tissues preferentially stored proline, α alanine and sucrose. Increasing 
NaCl levels were also accompanied by a significant accumulation of malate in 
leaves. Involvement of these solutes in osmotic adjustment was considered low. 
Nevertheless, they seemed to have an important role in controlling 
photosynthesis which capacity was enhanced by low salinity and decreased with 
increasing salinity (evaluated by actual photochemical efficiency of photosystem 
II and chlorophyll contents). The unchanged maximum photochemical efficiency of 
photosystem II accompanied by the increase of the non-photochemical quenching, 
the enhancement of the total antioxidant activity and the decrease of the 
malondialdehyde contents in leaves showed efficient protection of membranes and 
photosystem II from photo-oxidative damage. This protection seemed to be 
attributed to proline and sucrose largely accumulated in leaves treated with 
salt.

Understanding how organic solvent-stable proteins can function in anhydrous and 
often complex solutions is essential for the study of the interaction of protein 
and molecular immiscible interfaces and the design of efficient industrial 
enzymes in nonaqueous solvents. Using an extremophilic lipase from Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa as an example, we investigated the conformational dynamics of an 
organic solvent-tolerant enzyme in complex solvent milieux. Four 100-ns 
molecular dynamics simulations of the lipase were performed in solvent systems: 
water, hexane, and two mixtures of hexane and water, 5% and 95% (w/w) hexane. 
Our results show a solvent-dependent structural change of the protein, 
especially in the region that regulates the admission of the substrate. We 
observed that the lipase is much less flexible in hexane than in aqueous 
solution or at the immiscible interface. Quantified by the size of the 
accessible channel, the lipase in water has a closed-gate conformation and no 
access to the active site, while in the hexane-containing systems, the lipase is 
at various degrees of open-gate state, with the immiscible interface setup being 
in the widely open conformation ensembles. The composition of explicit solvents 
in the access channel showed a significant influence on the conformational 
dynamics of the protein. Interestingly, the slowest step (bottleneck) of the 
hexane-induced conformational switch seems to be correlated with the slow 
dehydration dynamics of the channel.

Araruama Lagoon is an environment characterized by high salt concentrations. The 
low raining and high evaporation rates in this region favored the development of 
many salty ponds around the lagoon. In order to reveal the microbial composition 
of this system, we performed a 16S rRNA gene survey. Among archaea, most clones 
were related to uncultured environmental Euryarchaeota. In lagoon water, we 
found some clones related to Methanomicrobia and Methanothermococcus groups, 
while in the saline pond water members related to the genus Haloarcula were 
detected. Bacterial community was dominated by clones related to 
Gamma-proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Synechococcus in lagoon water, while 
Salinibacter ruber relatives dominated in saline pond. We also detected the 
presence of Alpha-proteobacteria, Pseudomonas-like bacteria and Verrucomicrobia. 
Only representatives of the genus Ralstonia were cosmopolitan, being observed in 
both systems. The detection of a substantial number of clones related to 
uncultured archaea and bacteria suggest that the hypersaline waters of Araruama 
harbor a pool of novel prokaryotic phylotypes, distinct from those observed in 
other similar systems. We also observed clones related to halophilic genera of 
cyanobacteria that are specific for each habitat studied. Additionally, two 
bacterioplankton molecular markers with ecological relevance were analyzed, one 
is linked to nitrogen fixation (nifH) and the other is linked to carbon fixation 
by bacterial photosynthesis, the protochlorophyllide genes, revealing a specific 
genetic distribution in this ecosystem. This is the first study of the 
biogeography and community structure of microbial assemblages in Brazilian 
tropical hypersaline environments. This work is directed towards a better 
understanding of the free-living prokaryotic diversity adapted to life in 
hypersaline waters.

BACKGROUND: Natrialba magadii is an aerobic chemoorganotrophic member of the 
Euryarchaeota and is a dual extremophile requiring alkaline conditions and 
hypersalinity for optimal growth. The genome sequence of Nab. magadii type 
strain ATCC 43099 was deciphered to obtain a comprehensive insight into the 
genetic content of this haloarchaeon and to understand the basis of some of the 
cellular functions necessary for its survival.
RESULTS: The genome of Nab. magadii consists of four replicons with a total 
sequence of 4,443,643 bp and encodes 4,212 putative proteins, some of which 
contain peptide repeats of various lengths. Comparative genome analyses 
facilitated the identification of genes encoding putative proteins involved in 
adaptation to hypersalinity, stress response, glycosylation, and polysaccharide 
biosynthesis. A proton-driven ATP synthase and a variety of putative cytochromes 
and other proteins supporting aerobic respiration and electron transfer were 
encoded by one or more of Nab. magadii replicons. The genome encodes a number of 
putative proteases/peptidases as well as protein secretion functions. Genes 
encoding putative transcriptional regulators, basal transcription factors, 
signal perception/transduction proteins, and chemotaxis/phototaxis proteins were 
abundant in the genome. Pathways for the biosynthesis of thiamine, riboflavin, 
heme, cobalamin, coenzyme F420 and other essential co-factors were deduced by in 
depth sequence analyses. However, approximately 36% of Nab. magadii protein 
coding genes could not be assigned a function based on Blast analysis and have 
been annotated as encoding hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins. 
Furthermore, despite extensive comparative genomic analyses, genes necessary for 
survival in alkaline conditions could not be identified in Nab. magadii.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on genomic analyses, Nab. magadii is predicted to be 
metabolically versatile and it could use different carbon and energy sources to 
sustain growth. Nab. magadii has the genetic potential to adapt to its milieu by 
intracellular accumulation of inorganic cations and/or neutral organic 
compounds. The identification of Nab. magadii genes involved in coenzyme 
biosynthesis is a necessary step toward further reconstruction of the metabolic 
pathways in halophilic archaea and other extremophiles. The knowledge gained 
from the genome sequence of this haloalkaliphilic archaeon is highly valuable in 
advancing the applications of extremophiles and their enzymes.

Proteolytic Aeromonas caviae P-1-1 growing at wide-ranging pH (7.0-11.0) and 
moderate salinity (0-5% NaCl) was isolated from cattle shed of Thanjavur, India. 
It produced lipase, gelatinase, and polyhydroxybutyrate. Different culture 
conditions, incubation time, carbon and nitrogen sources, vitamins, amino acids, 
surfactants, and metal ions for optimal growth and protease production of P-1-1 
were examined. Maximum protease (0.128 U/mL) production was achieved with 1% 
fructose, 1% yeast extract, 0.1% ammonium sulfate, 3% NaCl, 0.1% CaCl2 · 2H2O, 
1% glycine, 0.1% vitamin E, and 0.1% Tween-40 at pH 8.0 after 42 hr of 
incubation at 37°C. It was active over broad range of pH (7.0-12.0), temperature 
(15-100°C), and salinity (0-9% NaCl) with optima at pH 10.0, 55°C, and 3% NaCl. 
It retained 65 and 48% activities at pH 12.0 and 100°C, respectively. Partially 
purified protease was highly stable (100%) within pH range 7.0-12.0 and 
salinities of 0-5% NaCl for 48 hr. Cu2+, Mn2+, Co2+, and Ca2+ did not inhibit 
its activity. Its stability at extreme pHs, temperatures, and in the presence of 
surfactants and commercial detergents suggests its possible application in 
laundry detergents. Partially purified protease was immobilized and reused. This 
is the first report of alkali-thermotolerant, surfactant-detergent-stable 
partially purified extracellular protease from A. caviae.

The stability of malate dehydrogenase (hMDH) from Halobacterium salinarum in 
aqueous medium at low salt concentrations (1 and 0.5 M NaCl) was studied at 4 
degrees and 25 degrees C. The results showed that hMDH was more stable at the 
higher salt concentration and the low temperature. hMDH was introduced into 
reverse micelles of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide in cyclohexane with 
1-butanol as co-surfactant. The hMDH stability in this system was studied at two 
omega(0) ([H(2)O]/[surfactant]) values and the effects of salt concentration, 
presence of substrate and dilution before or after its introduction into reverse 
micelles were examined. The results showed that the half-life of hMDH dissolved 
in buffer with 1 M NaCl was 12-50 days in reverse micelles (depending on the 
various conditions), in contrast to only about 1 day in aqueous medium at 25 
degrees C. These observations indicate that reverse micelles provide a 
microenvironment that allows a much greater stability of this enzyme compared 
with an aqueous medium.

The limitations of fungal laccases at higher pH and salt concentrations have 
intensified the search for new extremophilic bacterial laccases. We report the 
cloning, expression, and characterization of the bacterial cotA from Bacillus 
clausii, a supposed alkalophilic ortholog of cotA from B. subtilis. Both 
laccases were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and characterized fully in 
parallel for strict benchmarking. We report activity on ABTS, SGZ, DMP, caffeic 
acid, promazine, phenyl hydrazine, tannic acid, and bilirubin at variable pH. 
Whereas ABTS, promazine, and phenyl hydrazine activities vs. pH were similar, 
the activity of B. clausii cotA was shifted upwards by ~0.5-2 pH units for the 
simple phenolic substrates DMP, SGZ, and caffeic acid. This shift is not due to 
substrate affinity (K(M)) but to pH dependence of catalytic turnover: The k(cat) 
of B. clausii cotA was 1 s⁻¹ at pH 6 and 5 s⁻¹ at pH 8 in contrast to 6 s⁻¹ at 
pH 6 and 2 s⁻¹ at pH 8 for of B. subtilis cotA. Overall, k(cat)/K(M) was 10-fold 
higher for B. subtilis cotA at pH(opt). While both proteins were heat activated, 
activation increased with pH and was larger in cotA from B. clausii. NaCl 
inhibited activity at acidic pH, but not up to 500-700 mM NaCl in alkaline pH, a 
further advantage of the alkali regime in laccase applications. The B. clausii 
cotA had ~20 minutes half-life at 80°C, less than the ~50 minutes at 80°C for 
cotA from B. subtilis. While cotA from B. subtilis had optimal stability at 
pH~8, the cotA from B. clausii displayed higher combined salt- and 
alkali-resistance. This resistance is possibly caused by two substitutions 
(S427Q and V110E) that could repel anions to reduce anion-copper interactions at 
the expense of catalytic proficiency, a trade-off of potential relevance to 
laccase optimization.

BACKGROUND: Extracellular polymeric substances isolated from Aureobasidium 
pullulans (EAP), containing specifically 13% β-1,3/1,6-glucan, have shown 
various favorable bone-preserving effects. Textoria morbifera Nakai (TM) tree 
has been used as an ingredient in traditional medicine and tea for various 
pharmacological purposes. Thus, the present study was aimed to examine the 
synergistic anti-osteoporotic potential of mixtures containing different 
proportions of EAP and TM compared with that of the single formulations of each 
herbal extract using bilateral ovariectomized (OVX) mice, a renowned rodent 
model for studying human osteoporosis.
METHODS: Thirty five days after bilateral-OVX surgery, 9 combinations of EAP:TM 
(ratios = 1:1, 1:3, 1:5, 1:7, 1:9, 3:1, 5:1, 7:1, 9:1) and single separate 
formulations of EAP or TM were supplied orally, once a day for 35 days at a 
final concentration of 200 mg/kg. Variations in body weight gains during the 
experimental periods, as well as femur weights, bone mineral density (BMD), bone 
strength (failure load), and mineral content (calcium [Ca] and inorganic 
phosphorus [IP]) following sacrifice were measured. Furthermore, 
histomorphometric and histological profile analyses of serum biochemical 
parameters (osteocalcin content and bone specific alkaline phosphatase [bALP] 
activity) were conducted following sacrifice. Femurs histomorphometric analyses 
were also conducted for bone resorption, structure and mass. The results for the 
mixed formulations of EAP:TM and separate formulations were compared with those 
of risedronate sodium (RES).
RESULTS: The EAP:TM (3:1) formulation synergistically enhanced the 
anti-osteoporotic potential of individual EAP or TM formulations, possibly due 
to enhanced variety of the active ingredients. Furthermore, the effects of 
EAP:TM were comparable to those of RES (2.5 mg/kg) treatment.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that, the EAP:TM (3:1) combination 
might act as a new pharmaceutical agent and/or health functional food substance 
for curing osteoporosis in menopausal women.

We have investigated changes in plasma-membrane fluidity in relation to NaCl 
concentrations in yeasts and yeast-like fungi that were isolated from either 
subglacial ice or hypersaline waters. In both of these natural environments, 
these organisms are exposed to low water activity, due to either high NaCl 
concentrations or low temperatures. Our data indicate that the fluidity of the 
plasma membrane can be used as an indicator of fitness for survival in extreme 
environments. Fungi that can survive in such extreme environments, such as 
Hortaea werneckii in the hypersaline waters of salterns, and Cryptococcus 
liquefaciens in subglacial environments, showed similar profiles of 
plasma-membrane fluidity in response to raised salinity. The same was seen for 
ubiquitous fungi, which are generally adapted for different types of stress, 
such as Aureobasidium pullulans and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. Representatives of 
both of these groups modulated their plasma-membrane fluidity differently. When 
salinity exceeded their optimal range, the ubiquitous stress-tolerant species 
(A. pullulans, Rh. mucilaginosa) showed increased plasma-membrane fluidity, 
whereas in the dominant extremophiles (H. werneckii, Cr. liquefaciens), it 
decreased. On the other hand, the plasma membranes of the fungi with a narrow 
ecological amplitude (Arctic A. pullulans and Rhodosporium diobovatum) showed 
different responses.

Bacterial diversity associated with Baer Soda Lake in Inner Mongolia of China 
was investigated using a culture-independent method. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene 
libraries were generated using bacterial oligonucleotide primers, and 16S rRNA 
gene sequences of 58 clones were analyzed phylogenetically. The library was 
dominated by 16S rDNAs of Gram-negative bacteria (24% alpha-Proteobacteria, 31% 
beta-Proteobacteria, 33% gamma-Proteobacteria, and 2% delta-Proteobacteria), 
with a lower percentage of clones corresponding to Gram-positive bacteria. Forty 
cloned sequences were similar to that of known bacterial isolates (> 97% 
sequence similarity), represented by the species of the genera Brevundimonas, 
Comamonas, Alcaligenes, Stenotrophomonas, and Klebsiella. Eighteen cloned 
sequences showed less affiliation with known taxa (< 97% sequence similarity) 
and may represent novel taxa.

The diversity of Archaea from three different hypersaline environments was 
analyzed and compared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular 
phylogenetic techniques and cultivation approaches. The samples originated from 
a crystallization pond of a solar saltern in Spain (FC); an alkaline lake in 
Nevada, USA, (EMF); and a small pond from a slag heap of a potassium mine in 
Germany (DIE). Except for two 16S rDNA sequences that were related to 
crenarchaeota from soil and did not apparently belong to the indigenous 
halophilic community, all sequences recovered from environmental DNA or 
cultivated strains grouped within the Halobacteriaceae. Mostly 16S rDNA 
sequences related to the genera Halorubrum and Haloarcula were detected in 
sample FC, and organisms belonging to these genera were also recovered by 
cultivation. In contrast, sequences related to five different groups of 
halophilic archaea were amplified from sample DIE (including novel lineages with 
only uncultivated phylotypes), but the organisms that were cultivated from this 
sample fell into different groups (i.e., Natronococcus, Halorubrum, or 
unaffiliated) and did not overlap with those predicted using the 
culture-independent approach. With respect to the highly alkaline sample, EMF, 
four groups were predicted from the environmental 16S rDNA sequences, two of 
which ( Natronomonas and Haloarcula) were also recovered through cultivation 
together with Natronococcus isolates. In summary, we found that halophilic 
archaea dominate the archaeal populations in these three hypersaline 
environments and show that culturability of the organisms predicted by molecular 
surveys might strongly depend on the habitat chosen. While a number of novel 
halophilic archaea have been isolated, we have not been able to cultivate 
representatives of the new lineages that were detected in this and several other 
environmental studies.

The novel species Halomonas zhaodongensis NEAU-ST10-25(T) recently identified by 
our group is a moderate halophile which can grow at the range of 0-2.5 M NaCl 
(optimum 0.5 M) and pH 6-12 (optimum pH 9). To explore its halo-alkaline 
tolerant mechanism, genomic DNA was screened from NEAU-ST10-25(T) in this study 
for Na(+)(Li(+))/H(+) antiporter genes by selection in Escherichia coli KNabc 
lacking three major Na(+)(Li(+))/H(+) antiporters. One mrp operon could confer 
tolerance of E. coli KNabc to 0.8 M NaCl and 100 mM LiCl, and an alkaline pH. 
This operon was previously mainly designated mrp (also mnh, pha or sha) due to 
its multiple resistance and pH-related activity. Here, we will also use mrp to 
designate the homolog from H. zhaodongensis (Hz_mrp). Sequence analysis and 
protein alignment showed that Hz_mrp should belong to Group 1 mrp operons. 
Further phylogenetic analysis reveals that Hz_Mrp system should represent a 
novel sub-class of Group 1 Mrp systems. This was confirmed by a significant 
difference in pH-dependent activity profile or the specificity and affinity for 
the transported monovalent cations between Hz_Mrp system and all the known Mrp 
systems. Therefore, we propose that Hz_Mrp should be categorized as a novel 
Group 1 Mrp system.

Intracellular thermostable esterase produced by the extremophilic 
Geodermatophilus obscurus G20 was purified to homogeneity by a heat treatment, 
followed by an anion-exchange chromatography, and then characterized. The 
molecular weight of the purified enzyme determined by sodium dodecyl 
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was shown to be 
approximatively 55 kDa. The enzyme showed an optimal activity between pH 8.0 and 
9.0 and was stable in the pH range 7.0-10.0. Moreover, it is highly 
thermostable, with a residual activity greater than 90% after incubation at 80 
°C for more than 10 h. The enzyme showed preference for esters of p -nitrophenol 
with short chain fatty acid. When the p -nitrophenyl acetate (C2) was used as 
substrate, the Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m) ) and maximum velocity for the 
reaction (V(max) ) of esterase were 400 μM and 2500 U/mg protein, respectively. 
The effect of phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), a serine-specific 
inhibitor, on the enzyme activity suggested that the thermostable esterase 
belong to the serine hydrolase group. Because of its high thermostability, 
activity at alkaline pH, tolerance to methanol and various metal ions and 
specificity for short chain fatty acids, this enzyme showed high potential for 
use in biocatalysis. (© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim).

Microbial disproportionation of elemental sulfur to sulfide and sulfate is a 
poorly characterized part of the anoxic sulfur cycle. So far, only a few 
bacterial strains have been described that can couple this reaction to cell 
growth. Continuous removal of the produced sulfide, for instance by oxidation 
and/or precipitation with metal ions such as iron, is essential to keep the 
reaction exergonic. Hitherto, the process has exclusively been reported for 
neutrophilic anaerobic bacteria. Here, we report for the first time 
disproportionation of elemental sulfur by three pure cultures of 
haloalkaliphilic bacteria isolated from soda lakes: the Deltaproteobacteria 
Desulfurivibrio alkaliphilus and Desulfurivibrio sp. AMeS2, and a member of the 
Clostridia, Dethiobacter alkaliphilus. All cultures grew in saline media at pH 
10 by sulfur disproportionation in the absence of metals as sulfide scavengers. 
Our data indicate that polysulfides are the dominant sulfur species under highly 
alkaline conditions and that they might be disproportionated. Furthermore, we 
report the first organism (Dt. alkaliphilus) from the class Clostridia that is 
able to grow by sulfur disproportionation.

Xylanase A of Thermotoga neapolitana contains binding domains both at the N- and 
C-terminal ends of the catalytic domain. In the N-terminal position it contains 
two carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM) which belong to family 22. These CBMs 
bind xylan but not to cellulose. The gene encoding the mature peptide of these 
CBMs was fused with an alkaline active GH10 xylanase from Bacillus halodurans S7 
and expressed in Escherichia coli. The (His)(6) tagged hybrid protein was 
purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and characterized. Xylan 
binding by the chimeric protein was influenced by NaCl concentration and pH of 
the binding medium. Binding increased with increasing salt concentration up to 
200 mM. Higher extent of binding was observed under acidic conditions. The 
fusion of the CBM structures enhanced the hydrolytic efficiency of the xylanase 
against insoluble xylan, but decreased the stability of the enzyme. The optimum 
temperature and pH for the activity of the xylanase did not change.

Environmental stresses such as salinity directly impact crop growth, and by 
extension, world food supply and societal prosperity. It is estimated that over 
800 million hectares of land throughout the world are salt-affected. In arid and 
semi-arid regions, salt concentration can be close to that in the seawater. 
Hence, there are intensive efforts to improve plant tolerance to salinity and 
other environmental stressors. Salicylic acid (SA) is an important signal 
molecule for modulating plant responses to stress. In the present study, we 
examined, on multiple plant growth related endpoints, whether SA applied through 
the rooting medium could mitigate the adverse effects of salinity on tomato 
(Solanum lycopersicum) cv. Marmande. The latter is a hitherto understudied 
tomato plant from the above perspective; it is a classic variety that produces 
the large ribbed tomatoes in the Mediterranean and consumed worldwide. We found 
salt stress negatively affected the growth of cv. Marmande tomato plants. 
However, the SA-treated plants had greater shoot and root dry mass, leaf area 
compared to untreated plants when exposed to salt stress. Application of SA 
restores photosynthetic rates and photosynthetic pigment levels under salt 
(NaCl) exposure. Leaf water, osmotic potential, stomatal conductance 
transpiration rate, and biochemical parameters were also ameliorated in 
SA-treated plants under saline stress conditions. Overall, these data illustrate 
that SA increases cv. Marmande tomato growth by improving photosynthesis, 
regulation and balance of osmotic potential, induction of compatible osmolyte 
metabolism, and alleviating membrane damage. We suggest salicylic acid might be 
considered as a potential growth regulator to improve tomato plant salinity 
stress resistance, in the current era of global climate change.

Lipases expressed in microbial hosts have great commercial value, but their 
applications are restricted by the high costs of production and harsh conditions 
used in industrial processes, such as high temperature and alkaline environment. 
In this study, an Escherichia coli-Bacillus subtilis shuttle vector 
(pHS-cotB-Tm1350) was constructed for the spore surface display of the lipase 
Tm1350 from hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima MSB8. Successful 
display of the CotB-Tm1350 fusion protein on spore surface was confirmed by 
Western blot analysis and activity measurements. The optimal catalytic 
temperature and pH of the spore surface-displayed Tm1350 were 80 °C and 9, 
respectively, which were higher than non-immobilized Tm1350 (70 °C and pH 7.5). 
Analysis of thermal and pH stability showed that spore surface-displayed Tm1350 
retained 81 or 70 % of its original activity after 8 h of incubation at pH 8 or 
pH 9 (70 °C), which were 18 % higher than the retained activity of the 
non-immobilized Tm1350 under the same conditions. Meanwhile, recycling 
experiments showed that the recombinant spores could be used for up to three 
reaction cycles without a significant decrease in the catalytic rate (84 %). 
These results suggested that enzyme display on the surface of the B. subtilis 
spore could serve as an effective approach for enzyme immobilization, which has 
potential applications in the harsh biochemical industry.

16S rRNA gene clone libraries were separately constructed from three ponds with 
different salt concentrations, M2 (15%), TS38 (25%) and S5 (32%), located within 
a multipond solar saltern of Sfax. The 16S rRNA genes from 216 bacterial clones 
and 156 archaeal clones were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. 44 
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were generated for Bacteria and 67 for 
Archaea. Phylogenetic groups within the bacterial domain were restricted to 
Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, with the exception that one cyanobacterial OTU 
was found in the TS38 pond. 85.7, 26.6 and 25.0% of the bacterial OTUs from M2, 
TS38 and S5 ponds, respectively, are novel. All archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences 
were exclusively affiliated with Euryarchaeota. 75.0, 60.0 and 66.7% of the OTUs 
from, respectively, M2, TS38 and S5 ponds are novel. The result showed that the 
Tunisian multipond solar saltern harbored novel prokaryotic diversity that has 
never been reported before for solar salterns. In addition, diversity 
measurement indicated a decrease of bacterial diversity and an increase of 
archaeal diversity with rising salinity gradient, which was in agreement with 
the previous observation for thalassohaline systems. Comparative analysis showed 
that prokaryotic diversity of Tunisian saltern was higher than that of other 
salterns previously studied.

An ionic liquid-tolerant bacterium, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CMW1, was 
isolated from a Japanese fermented soybean paste. Strain CMW1 grew in the 
presence of 10 % (v/v) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]Cl), a 
commonly used ionic liquid. Additionally, strain CMW1 grew adequately in the 
presence of the hydrophilic ionic liquids 10 % (v/v) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium 
trifluoromethanesulfonate ([EMIM]CF3SO3) or 2.5 % (v/v) 
1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([BMIM]CF3SO3). Strain 
CMW1 produced an extracellular protease (BapIL) in the culture medium. BapIL was 
stable in the presence of 80 % (v/v) ionic liquids, [EMIM]CF3SO3, [BMIM]Cl, 
[BMIM]CF3SO3, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, 
1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium 
bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, and functioned in 10 % (v/v) these ionic 
liquids. BapIL was stable at pH 4.0-12.6 or in 4004 mM NaCl solution, and 
exhibited activity in the presence of 50 % (v/v) hydrophilic or hydrophobic 
organic solvents. BapIL was completely inhibited by 1 mM PMSF and partially by 
5 mM EDTA. BapIL belongs to the true subtilisins according to analysis of the 
deduced amino acid sequence. We showed that BapIL from the ionic liquid-tolerant 
B. amyloliquefaciens CMW1 exhibited tolerance to ionic liquid and halo, 
alkaline, and organic solvents.

Two different groups of haloalkaliphilic, obligately autotrophic, 
sulfur-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the genera Thioalkalimicrobium and 
Thioalkalivibrio have recently been discovered in highly alkaline and saline 
soda lakes. To understand response to their extreme environment and different 
occurrence in soda lakes, the growth kinetics and competitive behavior of 
several representatives have been characterized in detail using batch and 
pH-controlled continuous cultivation. The bacteria belong to the true 
alkaliphiles, growing within the pH range 7.5-10.6 with maximum growth rate and 
maximum growth yield at pH 9.5-10. On the basis of their response to salt 
content, three groups can be identified. All the Thioalkalimicrobium strains and 
some of the Thioalkalivibrio strains belonged to the moderate halophiles. Some 
of the Thioalkalivibrio strains from hypersaline soda lakes were extremely 
salt-tolerant and capable of growth in saturated soda brines. The 
Thioalkalimicrobium strains demonstrated relatively high specific growth rates, 
low growth yield, high maintenance, and extremely high rates of thiosulfate and 
sulfide oxidation. In contrast, the Thioalkalivibrio strains, in general, were 
slow-growing, high-yield organisms with lower maintenance and much lower rates 
of oxidation of sulfide and thiosulfate. Moreover, the latter survived 
starvation much better than Thioalkalimicrobium. Different growth 
characteristics and salt resistance appear to determine the outcome of the 
enrichment cultures from different soda lakes: Thioalkalimicrobium dominated in 
the enrichments with freshly obtained samples from diluted soda lakes at 
low-medium salinity, while Thioalkalivibrio was the predominant organism in 
enrichments from aged samples and at hypersaline conditions. In mixed 
thiosulfate-limited chemostat cultures at low salinity, Thioalkalimicrobium 
strains (mu(max)=0.33 h(-1)) out-competed Thioalkalivibrio strains (mu(max)=0.15 
h(-1)) at D>0.02 h(-1). The overall results suggest that Thioalkalimicrobium and 
Thioalkalivibrio represent two different ecological strategies.

The diversity of culturable bacteria associated with sea ice from four 
permanently cold fjords of Spitzbergen, Arctic Ocean, was investigated. A total 
of 116 psychrophilic and psychrotolerant strains were isolated under aerobic 
conditions at 4 degrees C. The isolates were grouped using amplified rDNA 
restriction analysis fingerprinting and identified by partial sequencing of 16S 
rRNA gene. The bacterial isolates fell in five phylogenetic groups: subclasses 
alpha and gamma of Proteobacteria, the Bacillus-Clostridium group, the order 
Actinomycetales, and the Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides (CFB) phylum. Over 
70% of the isolates were affiliated with the Proteobacteria gamma subclass. 
Based on phylogenetic analysis (<98% sequence similarity), over 40% of Arctic 
isolates represent potentially novel species or genera. Most of the isolates 
were psychrotolerant and grew optimally between 20 and 25 degrees C. Only a few 
strains were psychrophilic, with an optimal growth at 10-15 degrees C. The 
majority of the bacterial strains were able to secrete a broad range of 
cold-active hydrolytic enzymes into the medium at a cultivation temperature of 4 
degrees C. The isolates that are able to degrade proteins (skim milk, casein), 
lipids (olive oil), and polysaccharides (starch, pectin) account for, 
respectively, 56, 31, and 21% of sea-ice and seawater strains. The temperature 
dependences for enzyme production during growth and enzymatic activity were 
determined for two selected enzymes, alpha-amylase and beta-galactosidase. 
Interestingly, high levels of enzyme productions were measured at growth 
temperatures between 4 and 10 degrees C, and almost no production was detected 
at higher temperatures (20-30 degrees C). Catalytic activity was detected even 
below the freezing point of water (at -5 degrees C), demonstrating the unique 
properties of these enzymes.

Removal of aromatic compounds from alkaline and/or saline industrial wastewater 
is an environmental concern for industry. In addition, aromatics may be 
accumulating in soda lakes, unique natural systems, where the fate and toxicity 
of these contaminants is unknown. To determine the feasibility of aromatic 
compound biodegradation in saline and alkaline conditions, the effect of pH and 
salinity on the biodegradation of phenol as a model aromatic waste compound by 
the haloalkaliphilic bacterium Halomonas campisalis was examined. Phenol was 
degraded as a source of carbon and energy at pH 8-11 and 0-150 g/L NaCl. 
Metabolic intermediates catechol, cis,cis-muconate, and (+)-muconolactone were 
identified, thus indicating that phenol was degraded via the beta-ketoadipate 
metabolic pathway. Although phenol and catechol were completely degraded in all 
cases, small amounts of cis,cis-muconate accumulated proportionally to increases 
in pH. There was no noticeable influence of salinity on cis,cis-muconate 
accumulation except at 0 g/L NaCl where it was completely degraded. These 
results indicate that it may be feasible to use haloalkaliphiles forthe 
treatment of aromatics present in saline and/or alkaline systems. This is the 
first report of phenol and catechol biodegradation under combined saline and 
alkaline conditions.

A chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacterium (SOB) strain ALCO 1 capable 
of growing at both near-neutral and extremely alkaline pH was isolated from 
hypersaline soda lakes in S-W Siberia (Altai, Russia). Strain ALCO 1 represents 
a novel separate branch within the halothiobacilli in the Gammaproteobacteria, 
which, so far, contained only neutro-halophilic SOB. On the basis of its unique 
phenotypic properties and distant phylogeny, strain ALCO 1 is proposed as a new 
genus and species Thioalkalibacter halophilus gen. nov. sp. nov. ALCO 1 was able 
to grow within a broad range of salinity (0.5-3.5 M of total sodium) with an 
optimum at around 1 M Na+, and pH (7.2-10.2, pHopt at around 8.5). Na+ was 
required for sulfur-dependent respiration in ALCO 1. The neutral (NaCl)-grown 
chemostat culture had a much lower maximum growth rate (micromax), respiratory 
activity and total cytochrome c content than its alkaline-grown counterpart. The 
specific concentration of osmolytes (ectoine and glycine-betaine) produced at 
neutral pH and 3 M NaCl was roughly two times higher than at pH 10 in soda. 
Altogether, strain ALCO 1 represents an interesting chemolithoautotrophic model 
organism for comparative investigations of bacterial adaptations to high 
salinity and pH.

The Central Andes in northern Chile contains a large number of closed basins 
whose central depression is occupied by saline lakes and salt crusts (salars). 
One of these basins is Salar de Llamara (850 m a.s.l.), where large domed 
structures of seemingly evaporitic origin forming domes can be found. In this 
work, we performed a detailed microbial characterization of these domes. 
Mineralogical studies revealed gypsum (CaSO(4)) as a major component. Microbial 
communities associated to these structures were analysed by 454 16S rDNA 
amplicon sequencing and compared between winter and summer seasons. 
Bacteroidetes Proteobacteria and Planctomycetes remained as the main 
phylogenetic groups, an increased diversity was found in winter. Comparison of 
the upper air-exposed part and the lower water-submerged part of the domes in 
both seasons showed little variation in the upper zone, showing a predominance 
of Chromatiales (Gammaproteobacteria), Rhodospirillales (Alphaproteobacteria), 
and Sphingobacteriales (Bacteroidetes). However, the submerged part showed 
marked differences between seasons, being dominated by Proteobacteria (Alpha and 
Gamma) and Verrucomicrobia in summer, but with more diverse phyla found in 
winter. Even though not abundant by sequence, Cyanobacteria were visually 
identified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which also revealed the 
presence of diatoms. Photosynthetic pigments were detected by high-performance 
liquid chromatography, being more diverse on the upper photosynthetic layer. 
Finally, the system was compared with other endoevaporite, mats microbialite and 
Stromatolites microbial ecosystems, showing higher similitude with evaporitic 
ecosystems from Atacama and Guerrero Negro. This environment is of special 
interest for extremophile studies because microbial life develops associated to 
minerals in the driest desert all over the world. Nevertheless, it is endangered 
by mining activity associated to copper and lithium extraction; thus, its 
environmental protection preservation is strongly encouraged.

Na(+)/H(+) antiporters play important roles in ion and pH homeostasis. In this 
study, two NhaD homologues that effectively catalyze Na(+)/H(+) antiporter were 
identified from Halomonas sp. Y2, a halotolerant and alkaliphilic strain 
isolated from sodium enriched black liquor. They exhibited high sequence 
identity of 72 % and similar binding affinities for Na(+) and Li(+) 
translocation, while having different pH profiles. Ha-NhaD1 was active at pH 6.0 
and most active at pH 8.0-8.5, whereas Ha-NhaD2 lacked activity at pH 6.0 but 
exhibited maximum activity at pH 9.5 or higher. Based on multiple alignments, 11 
partially conserved residues were selected and corresponding mutants were 
generated for Ha-NhaD1. As expected, replacement of most of the hydrophobic 
residues abolished the cation exchange activities. Three serine residues at 
positions 200, 282 and 353 in Ha-NhaD1 were replaceable by alanines with partial 
retention of activity. The S353A mutant exhibited significantly reduced binding 
affinity for Na(+) and Li(+), while S282 mutant exhibited an alkaline shift of 
about 1.5 pH units, as compared to the wild type Ha-NhaD1. Serine at position 
282 was predicted to be located in transmembrane segment VIII and was found to 
be important in regulating pH sensitivity in concert with flanking residues.

Eutrema salsugineum is an extremophile related to Arabidopsis. Accessions from 
Yukon, Canada and Shandong, China, were evaluated for their tolerance to water 
deficits. Plants were exposed to two periods of water deficit separated by an 
interval of re-watering and recovery. All plants took the same time to wilt 
during the first drought exposure but Yukon plants took 1 day longer than 
Shandong plants following the second drought treatment. Following re-watering 
and turgor recovery, solute potentials of Shandong leaves returned to predrought 
values while those of Yukon leaves were lower than predrought levels consistent 
with having undergone osmotic adjustment. Polar metabolites profiled in 
re-watered plants showed that different metabolites are accumulated by Yukon and 
Shandong plants recovering from a water deficit with glucose more abundant in 
Yukon and fructose in Shandong leaves. The drought-responsive expression of 
dehydrin genes RAB18, ERD1, RD29A and RD22 showed greater changes in transcript 
abundance in Yukon relative to Shandong leaves during both water deficits and 
recovery with the greatest difference in expression appearing during the second 
drought. We propose that the initial exposure of Yukon plants to drought renders 
them more resilient to water loss during a subsequent water deficit leading to 
delayed wilting. Yukon plants also established a high leaf water content and 
increased specific leaf area during the second deficit. Shandong plants 
undergoing the same treatment regime do not show the same beneficial drought 
tolerance responses and likely use drought avoidance to cope with water 
deficits.

Three novel orange, ultramicrobacterial isolates, UMB10, UMB14, and UMB34(T) 
were isolated from enrichment cultures inoculated with a melted 3,043 m deep 
Greenland ice core sample. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences 
indicated that the isolates belonged to a single species within the genus 
Chryseobacterium. They were most closely related to Chryseobacterium aquaticum 
(99.3%), Chryseobacterium soli (97.1%), and Chryseobacterium soldanellicola 
(96.9%). Genomic hybridization showed low levels of relatedness between UMB34(T) 
and C. aquaticum and C. soldanellicola (19-30%) and C. soli and Chryseobacterium 
jejuense (45-56%). Comparative genomic fingerprinting analysis using the 
enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) sequence showed nearly 
identical banding patterns for the three isolates and these patterns were 
distinct from those of C. aquaticum, C. soldanellicola, C. soli, and C. 
jejuense. The cells were short rods, lacked flagella, had cell volumes of <0.1 
mum(3), formed buds and smaller protrusions (blebs), produced copious 
extracellular material and a flexirubin type pigment. UMB34(T) produced acids 
from carbohydrates and utilized glucose and maltose although it did not 
assimilate mannose. The DNA G + C was 39.6-41.6 mol%. Based on the differences 
from validly named Chryseobacterium species, it was concluded that these 
isolates represent a new species for which the name, Chryseobacterium 
greenlandense is proposed. The type strain is UMB34(T) (=CIP 110007T = NRRL 
B-59357).

Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are valuable molecules that are the basis 
for important photoprotective constituents. Here we report molecular analysis of 
mycosporine-like amino acid biosynthetic genes from the halotolerant 
cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica, which can survive at high salinity and 
alkaline pH. This extremophile was found to have a unique MAA core 
(4-deoxygadusol)-synthesizing gene separated from three other genes. In vivo 
analysis showed accumulation of the mycosporine-2-glycine but not shinorine or 
mycosporine-glycine. Mycosporine-2-glycine accumulation was stimulated more 
under the stress condition of high salinity than UV-B radiation. The Aphanothece 
MAA biosynthetic genes also manifested a strong transcript level response to 
salt stress. Furthermore, the transformed Escherichia coli and Synechococcus 
strains expressing four putative Aphanothece MAA genes under the control of a 
native promoter were found to be capable of synthesizing mycosporine-2-glycine. 
The accumulation level of mycosporine-2-glycine was again higher under the 
high-salinity condition. In the transformed E. coli cells, its level was 
approximately 85.2 ± 0.7 μmol/g (dry weight). Successful production of a large 
amount of mycosporine in these cells provides a new opportunity in the search 
for an alternative natural sunscreen compound source.

This study reports the purification and characterization of an extracellular 
haloalkaline serine protease from the moderately halophilic bacterium, Bacillus 
iranensis, strain X5B. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity by acetone 
precipitation, ultrafiltration and carboxymethyl (CM) cation exchange 
chromatography, respectively. The purified protease was a monomeric enzyme with 
a relative molecular mass of 48-50 kDa and it was inhibited by PMSF indicating 
that it is a serine-protease. The optimum pH, temperature and NaCl concentration 
were 9.5, 35 °C and 0.98 M, respectively. The enzyme showed a significant 
tolerance to salt and alkaline pH. It retained approximately 50% of activity at 
2.5 M NaCl and about 70% of activity at highly alkaline pH of 11.0; therefore, 
it was a moderately halophilic and also can be activated by metals, especially 
by Ca(2+). The specific activity of the purified protease was measured to be 
425.23 μmol of tyrosine/min per mg of protein using casein as a substrate. The 
apparent K m and V max values were 0.126 mM and 0.523 mM/min, respectively and 
the accurate value of k cat was obtained as 3.284 × 10(-2) s(-1). These special 
and important characteristics make this serine protease as valuable tool for 
industrial applications.

A novel gram-positive, strictly aerobic, motile, sporulating, and facultatively 
alkaliphilic bacterium designated KSM-KP43 was isolated from a sample of soil. 
The results of 16S rRNA sequence analysis placed this bacterium in a cluster 
with Bacillus halmapalus. However, the level of the DNA-DNA hybridization of 
KSM-KP43 with B. halmapalus was less than 25%. Moreover, the G + C contents of 
the genomic DNA were 41.6 mol% for KSM-KP43 and 38.6 mol% for B. halmapalus. 
Because there were also differences in physiological properties and cellular 
fatty acid composition between the two organisms, we propose KSM-KP43 as a novel 
species of alkaliphilic Bacillus. This novel strain produces a new class of 
protease, an oxidatively stable serine protease that is suitable for use in 
bleach-based detergents. The enzyme contained 640 amino acid residues, including 
a possible approximately 200-amino-acid prepropeptide in the N-terminal and a 
unique stretch of approximately 160 amino acids in the C-terminal regions 
(434-amino-acid mature enzyme with a calculated molecular mass of 45,301 Da). 
The C-terminal half after the putative catalytic Ser255 and the contiguous 
C-terminal extension shared local similarity to internal segments of a 
membrane-associated serine protease of a marine microbial assemblage and the 
serine protease/ABC transporter precursors of the slime mold Dictyostelium 
discoideum, and to the C-terminal half of a cold-active alkaline serine protease 
of a psychrotrophic Shewanella strain.

The extremely thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus is a model organism 
for structural biology and systems biology, and the so-called ""Structural and 
Functional Whole-Cell Project for T. thermophilus HB8"" is in progress. The 
released genomic sequence of the strain HB8 is composed of chromosome, pTT27 
megaplasmid, and pTT8 plasmid. In this paper, however, a third plasmid was 
demonstrated and its sequence was determined. Although this plasmid pVV8 had 
been reported before, limited information and an unfortunate dropout in the 
substrain, whose genomic sequence was determined, would have prevented the 
plasmid from coming to public attention. The intrinsic circular plasmid, which 
was estimated to be six to ten copies in a cell, is 81151 bp and its G + C 
content is 68%. Among the identified 91 ORFs, a single gene has been 
experimentally analyzed before and is known as xylose isomerase. The 
phnCDEGHIJKLMX operon related to phosphonate metabolism, alkaline phosphatase, 
putative transcriptional regulators, several sets of toxin-antitoxin system, and 
transposase-like ORFs are also encoded on the pVV8 plasmid. Although association 
with cell aggregation was the one phenotypic characteristic of the plasmid that 
had been reported, it was never confirmed. Comparison of T. thermophilus HB8 
strains suggests that the pVV8 is nonessential for growth.

Extremophilic microbial derived lipases have been widely applied in different 
biotechnological processes due to their resistance to harsh conditions such as 
high salt concentration, elevated temperature, and extreme acidic or alkaline 
pH. The present study was designed to overproduce the halophilic, 
thermoalkalophilic lipase of Bacillus atrophaeus FSHM2 through chemically 
induced random mutagenesis and optimization of cultural medium components 
assisted by statistical experimental design. At first, improvement of lipase 
production ability of B. atrophaeus FSHM2 was performed through exposure of the 
wild bacterial strain to ethidium bromide for 5-90 min to obtain a suitable 
mutant of lipase producer (designated as EB-5, 4301.1 U/l). Afterwards, 
Plackett-Burman experimental design augmented to D-optimal design was employed 
to optimize medium components (olive oil, maltose, glucose, sucrose, tryptone, 
urea, (NH4)2SO4, NaCl, CaCl2, and ZnSO4) for lipase production by the EB-5 
mutant. A maximum lipase production of 14,824.3 U/l was predicted in the optimum 
medium containing 5% of olive oil, 0.5% of glucose, 0.5% of sucrose, 2% of 
maltose, 2.5 g/l of yeast extract, 1.75 g/l of urea, 1.75 g/l of (NH4)2SO4, 
2.5 g/l of tryptone, 2 g/l of NaCl, 1 g/l of CaCl2, and 1 g/l of ZnSO4. A mean 
value of 14,773 ± 576.9 U/l of lipase was acquired from real experiments.

Mono Lake sediment slurries incubated with lactate and tellurite [Te(IV)] turned 
progressively black with time because of the precipitation of elemental 
tellurium [Te(0)]. An enrichment culture was established from these slurries 
that demonstrated Te(IV)-dependent growth. The enrichment was purified by 
picking isolated black colonies from lactate/Te(IV) agar plates, followed by 
repeated streaking and picking. The isolate, strain MLTeJB, grew in aqueous 
Te(IV)-medium if provided with a small amount of sterile solid phase material 
(e.g., agar plug; glass beads). Strain MLTeJB grew at high concentrations of 
Te(IV) (~8 mM) by oxidizing lactate to acetate plus formate, while reducing 
Te(IV) to Te(0). Other electron acceptors that were found to sustain growth were 
tellurate, selenate, selenite, arsenate, nitrate, nitrite, fumarate and oxygen. 
Notably, growth on arsenate, nitrate, nitrite and fumarate did not result in the 
accumulation of formate, implying that in these cases lactate was oxidized to 
acetate plus CO(2). Strain MLTeJB is a low G + C Gram positive motile rod with 
pH, sodium, and temperature growth optima at 8.5-9.0, 0.5-1.5 M, and 40 degrees 
C, respectively. The epithet Bacillus beveridgei strain MLTeJB(T) is proposed.

Natronomonas pharaonis is an archaeon adapted to two extreme conditions: high 
salt concentration and alkaline pH. It has become one of the model organisms for 
the study of extremophilic life. Here, we present a genome-scale, manually 
curated metabolic reconstruction for the microorganism. The reconstruction 
itself represents a knowledge base of the haloalkaliphile's metabolism and, as 
such, would greatly assist further investigations on archaeal pathways. In 
addition, we experimentally determined several parameters relevant to growth, 
including a characterization of the biomass composition and a quantification of 
carbon and oxygen consumption. Using the metabolic reconstruction and the 
experimental data, we formulated a constraints-based model which we used to 
analyze the behavior of the archaeon when grown on a single carbon source. 
Results of the analysis include the finding that Natronomonas pharaonis, when 
grown aerobically on acetate, uses a carbon to oxygen consumption ratio that is 
theoretically near-optimal with respect to growth and energy production. This 
supports the hypothesis that, under simple conditions, the microorganism 
optimizes its metabolism with respect to the two objectives. We also found that 
the archaeon has a very low carbon efficiency of only about 35%. This 
inefficiency is probably due to a very low P/O ratio as well as to the other 
difficulties posed by its extreme environment.

A novel thermo-alkali-stable catalase from Thermus brockianus was purified and 
characterized. The protein was purified from a T. brockianus cell extract in a 
three-step procedure that resulted in 65-fold purification to a specific 
activity of 5300 U/mg. The enzyme consisted of four identical subunits of 42.5 
kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE and a total molecular mass measured by gel 
filtration of 178 kDa. The catalase was active over a temperature range from 30 
to 94 degrees C and a pH range from 6 to 10, with optimum activity occurring at 
90 degrees C and pH 8. At pH 8, the enzyme was extremely stable at elevated 
temperatures with half-lives of 330 h at 80 degrees C and 3 h at 90 degrees C. 
The enzyme also demonstrated excellent stability at 70 degrees C and alkaline pH 
with measured half-lives of 510 h and 360 h at pHs of 9 and 10, respectively. 
The enzyme had an unusual pyridine hemochrome spectrum and appears to utilize 
eight molecules of heme c per tetramer rather than protoheme IX present in the 
majority of catalases studied to date. The absorption spectrum suggested that 
the heme iron of the catalase was in a 6-coordinate low spin state rather than 
the typical 5-coordinate high spin state. A K(m) of 35.5 mM and a V(max) of 20.3 
mM/min.mg protein for hydrogen peroxide was measured, and the enzyme was not 
inhibited by hydrogen peroxide at concentrations up to 450 mM. The enzyme was 
strongly inhibited by cyanide and the traditional catalase inhibitor 
3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. The enzyme also showed no peroxidase activity to 
peroxidase substrates o-dianisidine and 
2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), a trait of typical 
monofunctional catalases. However, unlike traditional monofunctional catalases, 
the T. brockianus catalase was easily reduced by dithionite, a characteristic of 
catalase-peroxidases. The above properties indicate that this catalase has 
potential for applications in industrial bleaching processes to remove residual 
hydrogen peroxide from process streams.

The microbial ecology associated with siliceous sinters was studied in five 
geochemically diverse Icelandic geothermal systems. Bacterial 16S rRNA clone 
libraries were constructed from water-saturated precipitates from each site 
resulting in a total of 342 bacterial clone sequences and 43 species level 
phylotypes. In near-neutral, saline (2.6-4.7% salinity) geothermal waters where 
sinter growth varied between 10 and ~300 kg year(-1) m(-2), 16S rRNA gene 
analyses revealed very low (no OTUs could be detected) to medium (9 OTUs) 
microbial activity. The most dominant phylotypes found in these waters belong to 
marine genera of the Proteobacteria. In contrast, in alkaline (pH = 9-10), 
meteoric geothermal waters with temperature = 66-96°C and <1-20 kg year(-1)m(-2) 
sinter growth, extensive biofilms (a total of 34 OTUs) were observed within the 
waters and these were dominated by members of the class Aquificae (mostly 
related to Thermocrinis), Deinococci (Thermus species) as well as 
Proteobacteria. The observed phylogenetic diversity (i.e., number and 
composition of detected OTUs) is argued to be related to the physico-chemical 
regime prevalent in the studied geothermal waters; alkaliphilic thermophilic 
microbial communities with phylotypes related to heterotrophic and autotrophic 
microorganisms developed in alkaline high temperature waters, whereas halophilic 
mesophilic communities dominated coastal geothermal waters.

Cotula coronopifolia is a wild annual Asteraceae that grows in 
periodically-flooded prone environments and seems highly tolerant to periodic 
flooding. Seedlings of about 15 cm were collected directly from the edge of 
Soliman sabkha (N-E Tunisia, semi-arid stage) and grown under greenhouse 
conditions. Two treatments were considered: drainage and flooding. After 56 days 
of treatment, flooded plants showed a pronounced growth increase. This 
performance was essentially associated with significant increment in biomass 
production of both shoots and roots (about 220% of the control). The appropriate 
response to flooding was also characterized by the ability of the species to 
maintain its water status under such conditions. Neither water content nor water 
potential showed a significant variation as compared to those of non-flooded 
plants. However, transpiration rate decreased slightly but significantly in 
flooded plants (from 0.86 to 0.64 mmol H2O m-2 s-1). Na+ and K+ concentrations 
were practically maintained under waterlogging conditions, except a significant 
increase of Na+ content in roots of flooded plants (157% of the control). These 
responses were concomitant with maintenance of photosynthetic rate. However, the 
contents of chlorophylls a and b increased to 167% and 295%, respectively. It 
seems that the enhancement in these photosynthetic pigments together with a 
significant improvement in water use efficiency (from 4.66 to 6.07 mmol CO2 
mol-1 H2O) allowed to the species to compensate the decrease in photosynthetic 
rate. At the anatomical level, this species responded to flooding by a 
significant development of its root aerenchyma (+63%) and an increase in the 
lignification of its stem xylem tissues (+37%). Based on the presented data, the 
plant fitness under flooding conditions was a result of dynamic readjustment of 
several morphological, physiological, and anatomical adaptive traits. Flood 
requirement together with salt tolerance are responsible for the predominance of 
C. coronopifolia in a large area in its natural biotope where most plants cannot 
tolerate interactive effects of flooding and salinity.

The Atacama Desert, one of the driest deserts in the world, represents a unique 
extreme environmental ecosystem to explore the bacterial diversity as it is 
considered to be at the dry limit for life. A 16S rRNA gene (spanning the hyper 
variable V3 region) library was constructed from an alkaline sample of 
unvegetated soil at the hyperarid margin in the Atacama Desert. A total of 244 
clone sequences were used for MOTHUR analysis, which revealed 20 unique 
phylotypes or operational taxonomic units (OTUs). V3 region amplicons of the 16S 
rRNA were suitable for distinguishing the bacterial community to the genus and 
specie level. We found that all OTUs were affiliated with taxa representative of 
the Firmicutes phylum. The extremely high abundance of Firmicutes indicated that 
most bacteria in the soil were spore-forming survivors. In this study we 
detected a narrower diversity as compared to other ecological studies performed 
in other areas of the Atacama Desert. The reported genera were Oceanobacillus 
(representing the 69.5 % of the clones sequenced), Bacillus, Thalassobacillus 
and Virgibacillus. The present work shows physical and chemical parameters have 
a prominent impact on the microbial community structure. It constitutes an 
example of the communities adapted to live in extreme conditions caused by 
dryness and metal concentrations .

The ability of exogenous compatible solutes, such as proline, to counteract 
cadmium (Cd) inhibitory effects in young date palm plants (Phoenix dactylifera 
L. cv Deglet Nour) was investigated. Two-year-old date palm plants were 
subjected for five months at different Cd stress levels (0, 10 and 30 mg CdCl2 
kg(-1) soil) whether supplied or not with exogenous proline (20mM) added through 
the irrigation water. Different levels of Cd stress altered plant growth, gas 
exchanges and chlorophyll content as well as water status, but at different 
extent among them. In contrast, an increase of antioxidant enzymes activities of 
Cd-treated plants in association with high amounts of proline content, hydrogen 
peroxide (H2O2), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and electrolyte 
leakage (EL) were observed. Interestingly, exogenous proline mitigated the 
adverse effects of Cd on young date palm. Indeed, it alleviated the oxidative 
damage induced by Cd accumulation and established better levels of plant growth, 
water status and photosynthetic activity. Moreover, proline-treated plants 
showed high antioxidant enzymes activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase and 
glutathione peroxydase) in roots and leaves as compared to Cd-treated plants.

Soap Lake, located in Washington State, is a naturally occurring saline and 
alkaline lake. Several organisms inhabiting this lake have been identified as 
producers of siderophores that are unique in structure. Bacterial isolates, 
enriched from Soap Lake sediment and water samples, were screened for 
siderophore production using both the chrome azurol S (CAS) agar plate and 
liquid methods. Bacterial isolate Halomonas sp. SL01 was found to produce 
relatively high concentrations of siderophores in liquid medium (up to 40 µM). 
Siderophores from the isolate were separated from the culture supernatant using 
solid phase extraction and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC). Siderophore structure was determined using LC/MS/MS (liquid 
chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry) and fatty acid methyl ester 
(FAME) GC. Two distinct new families of amphiphilic siderophores were produced 
by isolate SL01. All siderophores ranged in size from 989 to 1096 atomic mass 
units and consisted of a conserved peptidic head group (per family), which 
coordinates iron, coupled to fatty acid moieties. The fatty acyl moieties were 
C10-C14 in length and some with hydroxyl substitutions at the third α position. 
These siderophores resembled amphiphilic aquachelin siderophores produced by 
Halomonas aquamarina strain DS40M3, a marine bacterium as well as siderophores 
from isolate Halomonas sp. SL28 that was found to produce amphiphilic 
siderophores. Bacteria thriving under saline and alkaline conditions are capable 
of producing unique siderophores resembling those produced by microbes 
inhabiting marine environments.

Shallow CO2 vents are used as natural laboratories to study biological responses 
to ocean acidification, and so it is important to determine whether pH is the 
primary driver of bacterial processes and community composition, or whether 
other variables associated with vent water have a significant influence. Water 
from a CO2 vent (46 m, Bay of Plenty, New Zealand) was compared to reference 
water from an upstream control site, and also to control water acidified to the 
same pH as the vent water. After 84 h, both vent and acidified water exhibited 
higher potential bulk water and cell-specific glucosidase activity relative to 
control water, whereas cell-specific protease activities were similar. However, 
bulk vent water glucosidase activity was double that of the acidified water, as 
was bacterial secondary production in one experiment, suggesting that pH was not 
the only factor affecting carbohydrate hydrolysis. In addition, there were 
significant differences in bacterial community composition in the vent water 
relative to the control and acidified water after 84 h, including the presence 
of extremophiles which may influence carbohydrate degradation. This highlights 
the importance of characterizing microbial processes and community composition 
in CO2 vent emissions, to confirm that they represent robust analogues for the 
future acidified ocean.

A novel extremely haloalkaliphilic, strictly anaerobic, acetogenic bacterium 
strain APO was isolated from sediments of the athalassic, meromictic, alkaline 
Mono Lake in California. The Gram-positive, spore-forming, slightly curved rods 
with sizes 0.55-0.7x1.7-3.0 microm were motile by a single laterally attached 
flagellum. Strain APO was mesophilic (range 10-48 degrees C, optimum of 37 
degrees C); halophilic (NaCl range 1-20% (w/v) with optimum of 3-5% (w/v), and 
alkaliphilic (pH range 8.0-10.5, optimum 9.5). The novel isolate required sodium 
ions in the medium. Strain APO was an organotroph with a fermentative type of 
metabolism and used the substrates peptone, bacto-tryptone, casamino acid, yeast 
extract, l-serine, l-lysine, l-histidine, l-arginine, and pyruvate. The new 
isolate performed the Stickland reaction with the following amino acid pairs: 
proline + alanine, glycine + alanine, and tryptophan + valine. The main end 
product of growth was acetate. High activity of CO dehydrogenase and hydrogenase 
indicated the presence of a homoacetogenic, non-cycling acetyl-CoA pathway. 
Strain APO was resistant to kanamycin but sensitive to chloramphenicol, 
tetracycline, and gentamycin. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 44.4 mol% 
(by HPLC method). The sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of strain APO possessed 
98.2% similarity with the sequence from Tindallia magadiensis Z-7934, but the 
DNA-DNA hybridization value between these organisms was only 55%. On the basis 
of these physiological and molecular properties, strain APO is proposed to be a 
novel species of the genus Tindallia with the name Tindallia californiensis sp. 
nov., (type strain APO = ATCC BAA-393 = DSM 14871).

The first enumeration of cultivable obligately aerobic phototrophic bacteria 
from a terrestrial saline spring was accomplished in the East German Creek 
system (salinity approximately 6%), near Lake Winnipegosis, Manitoba, Canada. 
Occurring at densities up to 3.3x10(7) CFU/ml of sample, aerobic phototrophs 
comprised 15-36% of the total cultivable bacterial population in the diatom- and 
chlorophyte-dominated aerobic microbial mats. Many of the representative strains 
isolated for phenotypic characterization and phylogenetic analysis possessed 
<96% 16S rDNA sequence overlap with published species, including an obligately 
aerobic phototrophic gammaproteobacterium displaying only 92.9% 16S rDNA 
sequence similarity to Congregibacter litoralis. The springs yielded the most 
highly halotolerant aerobic anoxygenic phototroph yet recorded, strain EG11, 
which grew with 26% NaCl.

A novel, extremely alkaliphilic and cold-active esterase from Antarctic desert

A novel, cold-active and highly alkaliphilic esterase was isolated from an 
Antarctic desert soil metagenomic library by functional screening. The 1,044 bp 
gene sequence contained several conserved regions common to lipases/esterases, 
but lacked clear classification based on sequence analysis alone. Moderate 
(<40%) amino acid sequence similarity to known esterases was apparent (the 
closest neighbour being a hypothetical protein from Chitinophaga pinensis), 
despite phylogenetic distance to many of the lipolytic ""families"". The enzyme 
functionally demonstrated activity towards shorter chain p-nitrophenyl esters 
with the optimal activity recorded towards p-nitrophenyl propionate (C3). The 
enzyme possessed an apparent T(opt) at 20°C and a pH optimum at pH 11. Esterases 
possessing such extreme alkaliphily are rare and so this enzyme represents an 
intriguing novel locus in protein sequence space. A metagenomic approach has 
been shown, in this case, to yield an enzyme with quite different 
sequential/structural properties to known lipases. It serves as an excellent 
candidate for analysis of the molecular mechanisms responsible for both cold and 
alkaline activity and novel structure-function relationships of esterase 
activity.

Limits of life in hostile environments: no barriers to biosphere function?

Environments that are hostile to life are characterized by reduced microbial 
activity which results in poor soil- and plant-health, low biomass and 
biodiversity, and feeble ecosystem development. Whereas the functional biosphere 
may primarily be constrained by water activity (a(w)) the mechanism(s) by which 
this occurs have not been fully elucidated. Remarkably we found that, for 
diverse species of xerophilic fungi at a(w) values of <or= 0.72, water activity 
per se did not limit cellular function. We provide evidence that chaotropic 
activity determined their biotic window, and obtained mycelial growth at water 
activities as low as 0.647 (below that recorded for any microbial species) by 
addition of compounds that reduced the net chaotropicity. Unexpectedly we found 
that some fungi grew optimally under chaotropic conditions, providing evidence 
for a previously uncharacterized class of extremophilic microbes. Further 
studies to elucidate the way in which solute activities interact to determine 
the limits of life may lead to enhanced biotechnological processes, and 
increased productivity of agricultural and natural ecosystems in arid and 
semiarid regions.

Enchytraeus polatdemiri sp. nov. (Enchytaeidae, Oligochaeta) was discovered in 
the framework of a sampling campaign of the benthic invertebrate fauna of the 
hyperalkaline Lake Van in Eastern Anatolia, Turkey, the third-largest closed 
lake and the largest soda lake on Earth. It was the only oligochaete species 
found in all samples. DNA sequencing included a fragment of the mitochondrial 
cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, and a fragment of the nuclear histone 
3 (H3) gene. For comparison, specimens from laboratory cultures of E. albidus 
Henle, 1837, a widespread and morphologically similar species, were sequenced as 
well. The new species differs from E. albidus in comparatively small body size, 
2 or 3 chaetae per bundle, saddle-shaped clitellum, absence of a copulatory 
field between the male pores and vasa deferentia usually not extending beyond 
the clitellum. The individual gene trees of COI and H3, as well as the combined 
phylogenetic analysis of both trees, recovered Enchytraeus polatdemiri sp. nov. 
as a monophyletic group within the genus Enchytraeus, closely related to E. 
albidus, but with an average p-distance for COI of 14.5 %. E. polatdemiri sp. 
nov. may have evolved from a local population of Enchytraeus albidus, a species 
well-adapted to changing salinity conditions, or from a common ancestor into an 
extremophile species that dwells and reproduces in the profundal of a strongly 
alkaline soda lake.

An anaerobic thermophilic bacterium, designated strain JW/SA-NV4(T), was 
isolated from a xylan-supplemented enrichment culture from Trego hot spring 
located within the Black Rock Desert (NV, USA). Cells were generally straight or 
slightly bent rod-shaped, 0.4-0.8 microm in width and 3-6 microm in length 
during exponential growth. Cells from stationary phase were variable in size and 
shape, showing curved or bent morphology. Motility was not seen and flagella 
were not observed in electron micrographs. Sporulation was not observed. Strain 
JW/SA-NV4(T) stained Gram-negative but is phylogenetically Gram-type positive. 
Growth occurred at pH(25 degrees C) 6.8-8.8, with optimum growth at pH 8.4; no 
growth occurred at pH 9.0 or above or at 6.5 or below. With glucose or xylose as 
the carbon source, strain JW/SA-NV4(T) grew at 44-74 degrees C; no growth 
occurred at 76 degrees C or above or at 42 degrees C or below. However, the 
optimum temperature was 62 and 66 degrees C when grown on glucose and xylose, 
respectively. The shortest doubling time observed with glucose was approximately 
4 h, and with xylose approximately 3.4 h. Strain JW/SA-NV4(T) tolerated an 
atmosphere containing up to 0.1 % O(2); no growth occurred at a gas atmosphere 
of 0.2 % O(2). Chemo-organotrophic growth occurred with xylose, glucose, 
mannose, xylan, pyruvate, fructose, ribose, Casamino acids, mannitol, tryptone, 
peptone, cellobiose and yeast extract. When grown in mineral media containing 1 
g yeast extract l(-1) as an electron donor, thiosulfate and sulfur were reduced 
to sulfide. The G+C content of the DNA was 38.6 mol% (HPLC). 16S rRNA gene 
sequence analysis placed strain JW/SA-NV4(T) within the order 
Thermoanaerobacterales and within the Thermoanaerobacterales Incertae Sedis 
Family III, specifically between taxa classified within the genera 
Thermosediminibacter and Thermovenabulum. The closest phylogenetic neighbours 
were Thermosediminibacter oceani JW/IW-1228P(T) (94.2 % 16S rRNA gene sequence 
similarity) and Thermosediminibacter litoriperuensis JW/YJL-1230-7/2(T) (94.0 %)

genotypic characteristics, strain JW/SA-NV4(T) (=DSM 18802(T)=ATCC BAA-1454(T)) 
is proposed to represent the type strain of a novel species in a novel genus,

Microbial communities inhabiting deep-sea cold seep sediments at the 
northeastern Japan Sea were characterized by molecular phylogenetic and chemical 
analyses. White patchy microbial mats were observed along the fault offshore the 
Hokkaido Island and sediment samples were collected from two stations at the 
southern foot of the Shiribeshi seamount (M1 site at a depth of 2,961 m on the 
active fault) and off the Motta Cape site (M2 site at a depth of 3,064 m off the 
active fault). The phylogenetic and terminal-restriction fragment polymorphism 
analyses of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes revealed that microbial community 
structures were different between two sampling stations. The members of ANME-2 
archaea and diverse bacterial components including sulfate reducers within 
Deltaproteobacteria were detected from M1 site, indicating the occurrence of 
biologically mediated anaerobic oxidation of methane, while microbial community 
at M2 site was predominantly composed of members of Marine Crenarchaeota group 
I, sulfate reducers of Deltaproteobacteria, and sulfur oxidizers of 
Epsilonproteobacteria. Chemical analyses of seawater above microbial mats 
suggested that concentrations of sulfate and methane at M1 site were largely 
decreased relative to those at M2 site and carbon isotopic composition of 
methane at M1 site shifted heavier ((13)C-enriched), the results of which are 
consistent with molecular analyses. These results suggest that the mat microbial 
communities in deep-sea cold seep sediments at the northeastern Japan Sea are 
significantly responsible for sulfur and carbon circulations and the geological 
activity associated with plate movements serves unique microbial habitats in 
deep-sea environments.

In this study, metagenomic DNA was screened for the Na(+)/H(+) antiporter gene 
from the halophilic bacteria in Daban Salt Lake by selection in Escherichia coli 
KNabc lacking three major Na(+)/H(+) antiporters. One gene designated as Hb_nhaD 
encoding a novel NhaD-type Na(+)/H(+) antiporter was finally cloned. The 
presence of Hb_NhaD conferred tolerance of E. coli KNabc to up to 0.5 M NaCl and 
0.2 M LiCl, and an alkaline pH. Hb_NhaD has the highest identity (70.6%) with a 
putative NhaD-type Na(+)/H(+) antiporter from an uncharacterized Clostridiaceae 
species, and also has lower identity with known NhaD-type Na(+)/H(+) antiporters 
from Halomonas elongata (20.8%), Alkalimonas amylolytica (19.0%), Vibrio 
parahaemolyticus (18.9%) and Vibrio cholerae (18.7 %). pH-dependent 
Na(+)(Li(+))/H(+) antiport activity was detected from everted membrane vesicles 
prepared from E. coli KNabc carrying Hb_nhaD. Hb_NhaD exhibited very high 
Na(+)(Li(+))/H(+) antiport activity over a wide pH range from 6.5 to 9.0 with 
the highest activity at pH 7.0 which is significantly different from those of 
the above known NhaD-type Na(+)/H(+) antiporters. Also, the apparent K m values 
of Hb_NhaD for Na(+) and Li(+) at pH 7.0 were determined to be 1.31 and 2.16, 
respectively. Based on the above results, we proposed that Hb_NhaD should be 
categorized as a novel NhaD-type Na(+)/H(+) antiporter.

A hyperthermophilic, anaerobic archaeon was isolated from hydrothermal fluid 
samples obtained at the Okinawa Trough vents in the NE Pacific Ocean, at a depth 
of 1395m. The strain is obligately heterotrophic, and utilizes complex 
proteinaceous media (peptone, tryptone, or yeast extract), or a 21-amino-acid 
mixture supplemented with vitamins, as growth substrates. Sulfur greatly 
enhances growth. The cells are irregular cocci with a tuft of flagella, growing 
optimally at 98 degrees C (maximum growth temperature 102 degrees C), but 
capable of prolonged survival at 105 degrees C. Optimum growth was at pH 7 
(range 5-8) and NaCl concentration 2.4% (range 1%-5%). Tryptophan was required 
for growth, in contrast to the closely related strains Pyrococcus furiosus and 
P. abyssi. Thin sections of the cell, viewed by transmission electron 
microscopy, revealed a periplasmic space similar in appearance to the envelope 
of P. furiosus. The predominant cell membrane component was tetraether lipid, 
with minor amounts of diether lipids. Treatment of the cells by mild osmotic 
shock released an extract that contained a Zn(2+)-dependent alkaline 
phosphatase. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences encoding 16S rRNA and 
glutamate dehydrogenase places the isolate with certainty within the genus 
Pyrococcus although there is relatively low DNA-DNA hybridization (< 63%) with 
described species of this genus. Based on the reported results, we propose a new 
species, to be named Pyrococcus horikoshii sp.nov.

Soda lake sediments usually contain high concentrations of sulfide indicating 
active sulfate reduction. Monitoring of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in soda 
lakes demonstrated a dominance of two groups of culturable SRB belonging to the 
order Desulfovibrionales specialized in utilization of inorganic electron 
donors, such as formate, H(2) and thiosulfate. The most interesting 
physiological trait of the novel haloalkaliphilic SRB isolates was their ability 
to grow lithotrophically by dismutation of thiosulfate and sulfite. All isolates 
were obligately alkaliphilic with a pH optimum at 9.5-10 and moderately salt 
tolerant. Among the fifteen newly isolated strains, four belonged to the genus 
Desulfonatronum and the others to the genus Desulfonatronovibrio. None of the 
isolates were closely related to previously described species of these genera. 
On the basis of phylogenetic, genotypic and phenotypic characterization of the 
novel soda lake SRB isolates, two novel species each in the genera 
Desulfonatronum and Desulfonatronovibrio are proposed.

Comprehensive studies of the biodiversity of the microbial epilithic community 
on monuments may provide critical insights for clarifying factors involved in 
the colonization processes. We carried out a high-throughput investigation of 
the communities colonizing the medieval church of San Leonardo di Siponto 
(Italy) by Illumina-based deep sequencing. The metagenomic analysis of sequences 
revealed the presence of Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. Bacteria were 
Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, 
Firmicutes and Candidatus Saccharibacteria. The predominant phylum was 
Actinobacteria, with the orders Actynomycetales and Rubrobacteriales, 
represented by the genera Pseudokineococcus, Sporichthya, Blastococcus, 
Arthrobacter, Geodermatophilus, Friedmanniella, Modestobacter, and Rubrobacter, 
respectively. Cyanobacteria sequences showing strong similarity with an 
uncultured bacterium sequence were identified. The presence of the green algae 
Oocystaceae and Trebuxiaceae was revealed. The microbial diversity was explored 
at qualitative and quantitative levels, evaluating the richness (the number of 
operational taxonomic units (OTUs)) and the abundance of reads associated with 
each OTU. The rarefaction curves approached saturation, suggesting that the 
majority of OTUs were recovered. The results highlighted a structured community, 
showing low diversity, made up of extremophile organisms adapted to desiccation 
and UV radiation. Notably, the microbiome appeared to be composed not only of 
microorganisms possibly involved in biodeterioration but also of carbonatogenic 
bacteria, such as those belonging to the genus Arthrobacter, which could be 
useful in bioconservation. Our investigation demonstrated that molecular tools, 
and in particular the easy-to-run next-generation sequencing, are powerful to 
perform a microbiological diagnosis in order to plan restoration and protection 
strategies.

Sulfolobus acidocaldarius is a useful model organism for the genetic study of 
thermophilic archaea due to its ease of cultivation. Here we describe the 
development of a host-vector system for S. acidocaldarius consisting of SuaI 
restriction system-deficient strain SK-1 and shuttle vector pSAV2. The new host 
strain SK-1 was constructed by pop-out recombination based on the pyrE marker 
gene. Plasmid pSAV2 was constructed from the S. islandicus native plasmid pRN1, 
in which selectable markers and functional genes were inserted in suitable 
locations and orientations followed by the deletion of non-essential open 
reading frames. SK-1 allowed direct transformation without N(4)-methylation at 
SuaI restriction sites, so unmethylated vector pSAV2 could be introduced 
directly into SK-1 by electroporation. The transformants were selected by pyrEF 
complementation on xyrose-tryptone solid medium without prior liquid culturing. 
The transformation efficiency was approximately 1.0 × 10(3)/μg DNA. After 
replication in S. acidocaldarius, pSAV2 was successfully recovered from 
transformant cultures by the standard alkaline lysis method. Plasmid yield was 
approximately 40-50 ng/ml from late-log through stationary phase cultures. In 
addition, pSAV2 was maintained stably and at relatively high copy number in S. 
acidocaldarius.

Acidothermophilic bacteria of the genus Alicyclobacillus are frequent 
contaminants of fruit-based products. This study is the first attempt to 
characterize the physico-chemical surface properties of two Alicyclobacillus sp. 
and quantify their adhesion disposition to model materials [diethylaminoethyl 
(DEAE), carboxyl- and octyl-modified magnetic beads] representing materials with 
different surface properties used in the food industry. An insight into the 
mechanism of adhesion was gained through comparison of experimental adhesion 
intensities with predictions of a colloidal interaction model (XDLVO). 
Experimental data (contact angles, zeta potentials, size) on interacting 
surfaces (cells and materials) were used as inputs into the XDLVO model. The 
results revealed that the most significant adhesion occurred at pH 3. Adhesion 
of both vegetative cells and spores of two Alicyclobacillus sp. to all materials 
studied was the most pronounced under acidic conditions, and adhesion was 
influenced mostly by electrostatic attractions. The most intensive adhesion of 
vegetative cells and spores at pH 3 was observed for DEAE followed by 
hydrophobic octyl and hydrophilic carboxyl surfaces. Overall, the lowest rate of 
adhesion between cells and model materials was observed at an alkaline pH. 
Consequently, prevention of adhesion should be based on the use of alkaline 
sanitizers and/or alkaline rinse water.

Two novel taxa of heliobacteria, Heliorestis acidaminivorans sp. nov. strain 
HR10B(T) and 'Candidatus Heliomonas lunata' strain SLH, were cultured from 
shoreline sediments/soil of Lake El Hamra (Egypt) and lake water/benthic 
sediments of Soap Lake (USA), respectively; both are highly alkaline soda lakes. 
Cells of strain HR10B were straight rods, while cells of strain SLH were curved 
rods. Both organisms were obligate anaerobes, produced bacteriochlorophyll g, 
and lacked intracytoplasmic photosynthetic membrane systems. Although the 
absorption spectrum of strain HR10B was typical of other heliobacteria, that of 
strain SLH showed unusually strong absorbance of the OH-chlorophyll a component. 
Major carotenoids of both organisms were OH-diaponeurosporene glucosyl esters, 
as in other alkaliphilic heliobacteria, and both displayed an alkaliphilic and 
mesophilic phenotype. Strain HR10B was remarkable among heliobacteria in its 
capacity to photoassimilate a number of carbon sources, including several amino 
acids. Nitrogenase activity was observed in strain HR10B, but not in strain SLH. 
The 16S ribosomal RNA gene tree placed strain HR10B within the genus 
Heliorestis, but distinct from other described species. By contrast, strain SLH 
was phylogenetically more closely related to neutrophilic heliobacteria and is 
the first alkaliphilic heliobacterium known outside of the genus Heliorestis.

30 billion gallons of acidic, metal-contaminated water. This harsh environment 
is proving to be a source of unusual, biologically active microorganisms. 
Bioassay-guided fractionation using signal transduction enzyme assays led to the

Differences in the level of cold acclimation and cryoprotection estimated as ice 
nucleation activity in snow algae (Chlamydomonas cf. nivalis and Chloromonas 
nivalis), lichen symbiotic algae (Trebouxia asymmetrica, Trebouxia erici and 
Trebouxia glomerata), and a mesophilic strain (Chlamydomonas reinhardti) were 
evaluated. Ice nucleation activity was measured using the freezing droplet 
method. Measurements were performed using suspensions of cells of A750 
(absorbance at 750 nm) ~ 1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 dilutions for each strain. The 
algae had lower ice nucleation activity, with the exception of Chloromonas 
nivalis contaminated by bacteria. The supercooling points of the snow algae were 
higher than those of lichen photobionts. The supercooling points of both, 
mesophilic and snow Chlamydomonas strains were similar. The lower freezing 
temperatures of the lichen algae may reflect either the more extreme and more 
variable environmental conditions of the original localities or the different 
cellular structure of the strains examined.

Gram-positive bacteria capable of nitrogen fixation were obtained in microoxic 
enrichments from soda soils in south-western Siberia, north-eastern Mongolia, 
and the Lybian desert (Egypt). The same organisms were obtained in anoxic 
enrichments with glucose from soda lake sediments in the Kulunda Steppe (Altai, 
Russia) using nitrogen-free alkaline medium of pH 10. The isolates were 
represented by thin motile rods forming terminal round endospores. They are 
strictly fermentative saccharolytic anaerobes but tolerate high oxygen 
concentrations, probably due to a high catalase activity. All of the strains are 
obligately alkaliphilic and highly salt-tolerant natronophiles 
(chloride-independent sodaphiles). Growth was possible within a pH range from 
7.5 to 10.6, with an optimum at 9.5-10, and within a salt range from 0.2 to 4 M 
Na(+), with an optimum at 0.5-1.5 M for the different strains. The nitrogenase 
activity in the whole cells also had an alkaline pH optimum but was much more 
sensitive to high salt concentrations compared to the growing cells. The 
isolates formed a compact genetic group with a high level of DNA similarity. 
Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S-rRNA gene sequences placed the isolates into 
Bacillus rRNA group 1 as a separate lineage with Amphibacillus tropicus as the 
nearest relative. In all isolates the key functional nitrogenase gene nifH was 
detected. A new genus and species, Natronobacillus azotifigens gen. nov., sp. 
nov., is proposed to accommodate the novel diazotrophic haloalkaliphiles.

In this paper we describe denitrification at extremely high salt and pH in 
sediments from hypersaline alkaline soda lakes and soda soils. Experiments with 
sediment slurries demonstrated the presence of acetate-utilizing denitrifying 
populations active at in situ conditions. Anaerobic enrichment cultures at pH 10 
and 4 M total Na(+) with acetate as electron donor and nitrate, nitrite and 
N(2)O as electron acceptors resulted in the dominance of Gammaproteobacteria 
belonging to the genus Halomonas. Both mixed and pure culture studies identified 
nitrite and N(2)O reduction as rate-limiting steps in the denitrification 
process at extremely haloalkaline conditions.

A number of novel alkaliphilic organotrophic bacteria have been isolated from 
several saline and alkaline East African soda lakes. The new isolates grow at pH 
values between 7.0 and 11.0, with pH optima for growth between 9.0 and 10.0. 
Growth occurs at total salts concentration between 0% and 20% (w/v) with optimum 
at 0%-7% (w/v). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rDNA sequence comparison 
indicate that these isolates are related (>96% similarity) to members of the 
Halomonadaceae within the gamma-3 subdivision of the Proteobacteria. These 
analyses indicate that existing species within the Halomonadaceae fell within 
three main groups, one group comprising the type species of Halomonas, Halomonas 
elongata, and a number of other known species including one soda lake isolate. A 
second group constituting most of the remaining known species of Halomonas and 
related Chromohalobacter spp. includes 3 soda lake isolates with high DNA-DNA 
homologies. The third group included Halomonas halodenitrificans, Halomonas 
desiderata, Halomonas cupida, and 13 soda lake isolates. Phenotypic comparisons 
indicated that the majority of soda lake strains shared similar morphological, 
phenotypic, and chemotaxonomic properties to known strains of Halomonas but grew 
under alkaline conditions. The 3 soda lake isolates with high DNA-DNA homologies 
were, however, significantly different in antibiotic sensitivity pattern and in 
the utilization of several substrates, were unable to reduce nitrite, and showed 
low DNA-DNA homologies with known halomonads in the same group. We propose that 
these isolates comprise a new species of the genus Halomonas that we name 
Halomonas magadii sp. nov. The type strain is strain 21 MI (NCIMB 13595).

Biological entities and gradients of selected chemicals within the seemingly 
barren ice layers covering Lake Baikal were investigated. Ice cores 40-68 cm 
long were obtained from in shore and offshore sites of Southern Lake Baikal 
during the cold period of a year (March-April) in 2007 and 2008. In microscopic 
observations of the melted ice, both algae and bacteria were found in 
considerable numbers (>10(3) cells/L and >10(4) cells/ml, respectively). Among 
all organisms found, diatom was generally the most predominant taxon in the ice. 
Interestingly, both planktonic and benthic algae were present in considerable 
numbers (2-4×10(4) cells/L). Dominant phototrophic picoplankton were comprised 
of small green algae of various taxa and cyanobacteria of Synechococcus and 
Cyanobium. The bacterial community consisted mostly of short rod and cocci 
cells, either free-living or aggregated. Large numbers of yeast-like cells and 
actinomycete mycelium were also observed. Concentrations of silica, phosphorus, 
and nitrate were low by an order of magnitude where biota was abundant. The 
profile of the ice could be interpreted as vertical stratification of nutrients 
and biomass due to biological activities. Therefore, the organisms in the ice 
were regarded to maintain high activity while thriving under freezing 
conditions. Based on the results, it was concluded that the freshwater ice 
covering the surface of Lake Baikal is considerably populated by extremophilic 
microorganisms that actively metabolize and form a detritus food chain in the 
unique large freshwater ecosystem of Lake Baikal.

An alkaline beta-mannanase was purified to homogeneity from a culture broth of 
alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. N16-5. The enzyme had optimum activity at pH 9.5 and 
70 degrees C. It was composed of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular 
weight of 55 kDa deduced from SDS-PAGE, and its isoelectric point was around pH 
4.3. The enzyme efficiently hydrolyzed galactomannan and glucomannan, producing 
a series of oligosaccharides and monosaccharides. The beta-mannanase gene (manA) 
contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,479 bp, encoding a 32-amino acids 
signal peptide, and a mature protein of 461 amino acids, with a calculated 
molecular mass of 50,743 Da. Strain N16-5 ManA, deduced from the manA ORF, 
exhibited relatively high amino acid similarity to the members of the glycosyl 
hydrolase family 5. The eight conserved active-site amino acids in family 5 
glycosyl hydrolase were found in the deduced amino acid sequence of strain N16-5 
ManA.

Cold active esterases are a class of important biocatalysts that exhibit high 
activity at low temperatures. In this study, a search for putative cold-active 
esterase encoding genes from Monascus ruber M7 was performed. A cold-active 
esterase, named Lip10, was isolated, cloned, purified, and characterized. Amino 
acid sequence analysis reveals that Lip10 contained a conserved sequence motif 
Gly(173)-Xaa-Ser(175)-Xaa-Gly(177) that is also present in the majority of 
esterases and lipases. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Lip10 was a novel 
microbial esterase. The lip10 gene was cloned and heterologously expressed in 
Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), resulting in the expression of an active and soluble 
protein that constituted 40 % of the total cell protein content. Lip10 
maintained almost 50 % of its maximal activity at 4-10 °C, with optimal activity 
at 40 °C. Furthermore, Lip10 retained 184-216 % of its original activity, after 
incubation in 50 % (v/v) hydrophobic organic solvents for 24 h. The enzyme also 
exhibited high activity under alkaline conditions and good tolerance to metal 
ions in the reaction mixture. These results indicate that Lip10 may have 
potential uses in chemical synthesis and food processing industrial applications 
as an esterase.

Magadiite, a rare hydrous sodium-silicate mineral [NaSi7O13(OH)3·4(H2O)], was 
discovered about 50 years ago in sediments around Lake Magadi, a hypersaline 
alkaline lake fed by hot springs in the semi-arid southern Kenya Rift Valley. 
Today this harsh lacustrine environment excludes most organisms except microbial 
extremophiles, a few invertebrates (mostly insects), highly adapted fish 
(Alcolapia sp.), and birds including flamingos. Burrows discovered in outcrops 
of the High Magadi Beds (~25-9 ka) that predate the modern saline (trona) pan 
show that beetles and other invertebrates inhabit this extreme environment when 
conditions become more favourable. Burrows (cm-scale) preserved in magadiite in 
the High Magadi Beds are filled with mud, silt and sand from overlying 
sediments. Their stratigraphic context reveals upward-shallowing cycles from mud 
to interlaminated mud-magadiite to magadiite in dm-scale units. The burrows were 
formed when the lake floor became fresher and oxygenated, after a period when 
magadiite precipitated in shallow saline waters. The burrows, probably produced 
by beetles, show that trace fossils can provide evidence for short-term 
(possibly years to decades) changes in the contemporary environment that might 
not otherwise be recognised or preserved physically or chemically in the 
sediment record.

Among the most intriguing features characterizing extremophile plants is their 
ability to rapidly recover growth activity upon stress release. Here, we 
investigated the responses of the halophyte C. maritima to drought and recovery 
at both physiological and leaf proteome levels. Six week-old plants were either 
cultivated at 100% or at 25% field capacity. After 12 d of treatment, one lot of 
dehydrated plants was rewatered to 100% FC for 14 d (stress release). Drought 
stress impaired shoot hydration, photosynthetic activity and chlorophyll content 
compared to the control, resulting in severe plant growth restriction. This was 
concomitant with a marked increase in anthocyanin and proline concentrations. 
Upon stress release, C. maritima rapidly recovered with respect to all measured 
parameters. Two-dimensional gel-based proteome analysis of leaves revealed 84 
protein spots with significantly changed volumes at the compared conditions: 
twenty-eight protein spots between normally watered plants and stressed plants 
but even 70 proteins between stressed and recovered plants. Proteins with higher 
abundance induced upon rewatering were mostly involved in photosynthesis, 
glycolytic pathway, TCA cycle, protein biosynthesis, and other metabolic 
pathways. Overall, C. maritima likely adopts a drought-avoidance strategy, 
involving efficient mechanisms specifically taking place upon stress release, 
leading to fast and strong recovery.

Three strains of new obligately anaerobic alkaliphilic bacteria have been 
isolated as a saccharolytic component from the cellulolytic community of 
alkaline Lake Nizhnee Beloe (Transbaikal region, Russia), a lake with low salt 
concentration. DNA analysis of these strains showed an interspecies level of DNA 
similarity of 96-100%. Strain Z-79820 was selected for further investigations. 
Cells were Gram-positive, asporogenous, nonmotile short rods with pointed ends. 
The strain was a true alkaliphile: growth occurred from pH 7.2 to 10.2 with the 
optimum at pH 9.0. Strain Z-79820 was halotolerant and could grow in medium with 
up to 10% (w/v) NaCl, with the optimum between 0 and 4% NaCl. The new isolate 
obligately depended on Na+ ions in the form of carbonates or chlorides. Total 
Na+ content needed for optimal growth was 0.46 M Na+, with a wide range from 
0.023-0.9 M Na+ at which growth also occurred. The isolate was a mesophile and 
grew at temperatures from 6 to 50 degrees C (slow growth at 6 and 15 degrees C) 
with an optimum at 35 degrees C. The organotrophic organism fermented ribose, 
xylose, glucose, mannose, fructose, sucrose, mannitol, and peptone. The products 
of glucose fermentation were acetate, ethanol, formate, H2, and CO2. Yeast 
extract was required for some anabolic needs. The DNA G+C content of the type 
strain Z-79820 was 42.1 mol%. The new bacterium fell into the 16S rRNA gene 
cluster XV of the Gram-positive bacteria with low G+C content, where it formed 
an individual branch. Based on its growth characteristics and genotype traits, 
we propose the new genus and species named Alkalibacter saccharofermentans with 
the type strain Z-79820 (=DSM14828), Uniqem-218 (Institute Microbiology, RAS; 
http://inmi.da.ru).

The large majority of proteins of alkaliphilic Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4 grown 
at pH 7.5 and 10.5, as studied by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analyses, 
did not exhibit significant pH-dependent variation. A new surface layer protein 
(SlpA) was identified in these studies. Although the prominence of some apparent 
breakdown products of SlpA in gels from pH 10.5-grown cells led to discovery of 
the alkaliphile S-layer, the largest and major SlpA forms were present in large 
amounts in gels from pH 7.5-grown cells as well. slpA RNA abundance was, 
moreover, unchanged by growth pH. SlpA was similar in size to homologues from 
nonalkaliphiles but contained fewer Arg and Lys residues. An slpA mutant strain 
(RG21) lacked an exterior S-layer that was identified in the wild type by 
electron microscopy. Electrophoretic analysis of whole-cell extracts further 
indicated the absence of a 90-kDa band in the mutant. This band was prominent in 
wild-type extracts from both pH 7.5- and 10.5-grown cells. The wild type grew 
with a shorter lag phase than RG21 at either pH 10.5 or 11 and under either 
Na(+)-replete or suboptimal Na(+) concentrations. The extent of the adaptation 
deficit increased with pH elevation and suboptimal Na(+). By contrast, the 
mutant grew with a shorter lag and faster growth rate than the wild type at pH 
7. 5 under Na(+)-replete and suboptimal Na(+) conditions, respectively. 
Logarithmically growing cells of the two strains exhibited no significant 
differences in growth rate, cytoplasmic pH regulation, starch utilization, 
motility, Na(+)-dependent transport of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, or 
H(+)-dependent synthesis of ATP. However, the capacity for Na(+)-dependent pH 
homeostasis was diminished in RG21 upon a sudden upward shift of external pH 
from 8. 5 to 10.5. The energy cost of retaining the SlpA layer at near-neutral 
pH is apparently adverse, but the constitutive presence of SlpA enhances the 
capacity of the extremophile to adjust to high pH.

Berkeley Pit Lake in Butte, Montana, is an acid mine waste reservoir rich in 
toxic metals. A Pithomycessp. isolated from the Pit Lake yielded three tyrosine 
derivatives (1-3), one of which acts as a 5-HT((2a)) receptor ligand. This type 
of activity has been associated with migraine preventative and antihypertensive 
drugs. The isolation and characterization of compounds 1-3 and three 
sesquiterpenes (5-7) that have been isolated previously from higher plants are 
reported here.

Soda lake is hyper alkaline and saline habitat located in closed craters with 
high evaporation rate. In current study fungal diversity from water and sediment 
samples of a soda lake (Lonar lake) located in Buldhana district of Maharashtra, 
India was investigated using extensive culturomics approach and mimicking the 
natural conditions of Lonar lake in culture media. A total of 104 diverse 
isolates of extremophilic fungi were recovered from this study and 
phylogenetically characterized by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region 
sequencing. In addition, due to important role of phenol oxidase, and peroxidase 
in degradation of toxic phenol, lignin, etc., all isolated pure cultures were 
also screened for extracellular phenol oxidase and peroxidase production 
potential. Diversity analysis indicated that different groups of extremophilic 
fungi are present in the water and sediment samples of Lonar lake. A total of 38 
species of fungi belonging to 18-different genera were recovered. Out of 104 
isolates 32 showed ≤97% sequences similarity, which were morphologically 
different and could be potential novel isolates of extremophilic fungi. However, 
out of 104 isolates only 14 showed the extracellular phenol oxidase production 
potentials at alkaline pH. Curvularia sp. strain MEF018 showed highest phenol 
oxidase production at alkaline condition and had low sequence similarity with 
previously characterized species (96% with Curvularia pseudorobusta). Taxonomic 
characterization (morphological and physiological) and multi locus sequence 
analysis (MLSA) using combined alignment of ITS-LSU-gpd of strain MEF018 showed 
that it is a novel species of the genus Curvularia and hence proposed as 
Curvularia lonarensis sp. nov.

The ability of a psychrotolerant microbial consortium to degrade crude oil at 
low temperatures was investigated. The enriched arctic microbial community was 
also tested for its ability to utilize various hydrocarbons, such as long-chain 
alkanes (n-C24 to n-C34), pristane, (methyl-)naphthalenes, and xylenes, as sole 
carbon and energy sources. Except for o-xylene and methylnaphthalenes, all 
tested compounds were metabolized under conditions that are typical for 
contaminated marine liquid sites, namely at pH 6-9 and at 4-27 degrees C. By 
applying molecular biological techniques (16S rDNA sequencing, DGGE) nine 
strains could be identified in the consortium. Five of these strains could be 
isolated in pure cultures. The involved strains were closely related to the 
following genera: Pseudoalteromonas (two species), Pseudomonas (two species), 
Shewanella (two species), Marinobacter (one species), Psychrobacter (one 
species), and Agreia (one species). Interestingly, the five isolated strains in 
different combinations were unable to degrade crude oil or its components 
significantly, indicating the importance of the four unculturable microorganisms 
in the degradation of single or of complex mixtures of hydrocarbons. The 
obtained mixed culture showed obvious advantages including stability of the 
consortium, wide range adaptability for crude oil degradation, and strong 
degradation ability of crude oil.

Intracellular water dynamics in Haloarcula marismortui, an extremely halophilic 
organism originally isolated from the Dead Sea, was studied by neutron 
scattering. The water in centrifuged cell pellets was examined by means of two 
spectrometers, IN6 and IN16, sensitive to motions with time scales of 10 ps and 
1 ns, respectively. From IN6 data, a translational diffusion constant of 1.3 x 
10(-5) cm(2) s(-1) was determined at 285 K. This value is close to that found 
previously for other cells and close to that for bulk water, as well as that of 
the water in the 3.5 M NaCl solution bathing the cells. A very slow water 
component was discovered from the IN16 data. At 285 K the water-protons of this 
component displays a residence time of 411 ps (compared with a few ps in bulk 
water). At 300 K, the residence time dropped to 243 ps and was associated with a 
translational diffusion of 9.3 x 10(-8) cm(2) s(-1), or 250 times lower than 
that of bulk water. This slow water accounts for approximately 76% of cell water 
in H. marismortui. No such water was found in Escherichia coli measured on BSS, 
a neutron spectrometer with properties similar to those of IN16. It is 
hypothesized that the slow mobility of a large part of H. marismortui cell water 
indicates a specific water structure responsible for the large amounts of K(+) 
bound within these extremophile cells.

Alkaline cellulase-producing actinomycete strains were isolated from mud samples 
collected from East African soda lakes. The strains were identified as novel 
Streptomyces spp. by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. A cellulase gene (cel12A) from 
Streptomyces sp. strain 11AG8 was cloned by expression screening of a genomic 
DNA library in Escherichia coli. From the nucleotide sequence of a 1.5-kb DNA 
fragment, an open reading frame of 1,113 nucleotides was identified encoding a 
protein of 371 amino acids. From computer analysis of the sequence, it was 
deduced that the Cel12A mature enzyme is a protein of 340 amino acids. The 
protein contained a catalytic domain, a glycine-rich linker region, and a 
cellulose-binding domain of 221, 12, and 107 amino acids, respectively. FASTA 
analysis of the catalytic domain of Cel12A classified the enzyme as a family 12 
endoglucanase and the cellulose-binding domain as a family IIa CBD. Streptomyces 
rochei EglS was determined as nearest neighbor with a similarity of 75.2% and 
61.0% to the catalytic domain and the cellulose-binding domain, respectively. 
The cell2A gene was subcloned in a Bacillus high-expression vector carrying the 
Bacillus amyloliquefaciens amylase regulatory sequences, and the construct was 
transformed to a Bacillus subtilis host strain. Crude enzyme preparations were 
obtained by ultrafiltration of cultures of the Bacillus subtilis recombinant 
strain containing the 11AG8 cell2A gene. The enzyme showed 
carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) activities over a broad pH range (5-10) with an 
optimum activity at pH 8 and 50 degrees C. The enzyme retained more than 95% of 
its activity after incubation for 30 min under these conditions.

Microbial enzymes from extremophilic regions such as hot spring serve as an 
important source of various stable and valuable industrial enzymes. The present 
paper encompasses the modeling and optimization approach for production of 
halophilic, solvent, tolerant, and alkaline lipase from Staphylococcus arlettae 
through response surface methodology integrated nature inspired genetic 
algorithm. Response surface model based on central composite design has been 
developed by considering the individual and interaction effects of fermentation 
conditions on lipase production through submerged fermentation. The validated 
input space of response surface model (with R (2) value of 96.6%) has been 
utilized for optimization through genetic algorithm. An optimum lipase yield of 
6.5 U/mL has been obtained using binary coded genetic algorithm predicted 
conditions of 9.39% inoculum with the oil concentration of 10.285% in 2.99 hrs 
using pH of 7.32 at 38.8°C. This outcome could contribute to introducing this 
extremophilic lipase (halophilic, solvent, and tolerant) to industrial 
biotechnology sector and will be a probable choice for different food, 
detergent, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. The present work also 
demonstrated the feasibility of statistical design tools integration with 
computational tools for optimization of fermentation conditions for maximum 
lipase production.

The methionine biosynthetic pathway found in bacteria is controlled at the first 
step, acylation of the gamma-hydroxyl of homoserine. This reaction is catalyzed 
by one of two unique enzymes, homoserine transacetylase or homoserine 
transsuccinylase, which have no amino acid sequence similarity. We cloned, 
expressed, and purified homoserine transsuccinylase from the thermophilic 
bacterium Thermotoga maritima. Substrate specificity experiments demonstrated 
that acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) is the preferred acyl donor and is used at least 
30-fold more efficiently than succinyl-CoA. Steady-state kinetic experiments 
confirm that the enzyme utilizes a ping-pong kinetic mechanism in which the 
acetate group of acetyl-CoA is initially transferred to an enzyme nucleophile 
before subsequent transfer to homoserine. The maximal velocity, V/K (acetyl-CoA) 
and V/K (homoserine), all exhibited bell-shaped pH curves with apparent pKs of 
6.0-6.9 and 8.2-8.8. The enzyme was inactivated by iodoacetamide in a 
pH-dependent manner, with an apparent pK of 6.3, suggesting the presence of an 
active-site cysteine residue which forms an acetyl-enzyme thioester intermediate 
during catalytic turnover, similar to observations with other transsuccinylases. 
In addition, the enzyme is highly stable at elevated temperatures, maintaining 
full activity at 70 degrees C. Taken together, these data suggest that the T. 
maritima enzyme functions biochemically as a transacetylase, despite having the 
sequence of a transsuccinylase.

A cDNA encoding heat shock protein 70 of Antarctic ice algae Chlamydomonas sp. 
ICE-L (designated as CiHsp70) was identified by RT-PCR and rapid amplification 
of cDNA ends approaches. The full-length cDNA of CiHsp70 was 2,232 bp, 
consisting of a 5'-terminal untranslated region (UTR) of 76 bp, a 3'-terminal 
UTR of 203 bp with a poly (A) tail, and an open reading frame of 1,953 bp. The 
CiHsp70 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 651 amino acids with an ATPase domain of 
388 amino acids, the substrate peptide binding domain of 246 amino acids and a 
C-terminus domain of 17 amino acids. The inducible CiHsp70 cDNA was highly 
homologous to other plant cytosolic Hsp70 genes and clustered together with 
green algae and higher plant rather than brown algae, diatom and Cryptophyta. 
Antarctic ice algae were treated with different stress conditions and messenger 
RNA (mRNA) expression levels of CiHsp70 were quantified by quantitative RT-PCR. 
The results showed that both cold and heat shock treatments could stimulate 
CiHsp70 mRNA expression. Meanwhile, CiHsp70 mRNA expression level increased 
2.9-fold in response to UV-B radiation for 6 h, while the expression levels of 
CiHsp70 were remarkably increased after removing the UV-B radiation and 
immediately providing additional 6 h visible light. Furthermore, treating with 
62 or 93 per thousand NaCl for 2 h, CiHsp70 mRNA expression level increased 3.0- 
and 2.1-fold, respectively. Together, our observations revealed that CiHsp70 as 
a molecular chaperone might play an important role in Antarctic ice algae 
Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L acclimatizing to polar environment.

Böddi-szék is one of the shallow soda ponds located in the Kiskunság National 
Park, Hungary. In June 2008, immediately prior to drying out, an extensive algal 
bloom dominated by a green alga (Oocystis submarina Lagerheim) was observed in 
the extremely saline and alkaline water of the pond. The aim of the present 
study was to reveal the phylogenetic diversity of the bacterial communities 
inhabiting the water of Böddi-szék during the blooming event. Using two 
different selective media, altogether 110 aerobic bacterial strains were 
cultivated. According to the sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, most of the 
strains belonged to alkaliphilic or alkalitolerant and moderately halophilic 
species of the genera Bacillus and Gracilibacillus (Firmicutes), Algoriphagus 
and Aquiflexum (Bacteroidetes), Alkalimonas and Halomonas (Gammaproteobacteria). 
Other strains were closely related to alkaliphilic and phototrophic purple 
non-sulfur bacteria of the genera Erythrobacter and Rhodobaca 
(Alphaproteobacteria). Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene-based clone library 
indicated that most of the total of 157 clone sequences affiliated with the 
anoxic phototrophic bacterial genera of Rhodobaca and Rhodobacter 
(Alphaproteobacteria), Ectothiorhodospira (Gammaproteobacteria) and Heliorestis 
(Firmicutes). Phylotypes related to the phylum Bacteroidetes formed the second 
most abundant group. Clones related to the mainly anaerobic and alkaliphilic 
bacterial genera of Anoxynatronum (Firmicutes), Spirochaeta (Spirochaetes) and 
Desulfonatronum (Deltaproteobacteria) were also abundant. Further clone 
sequences showed less than 95 % similarity values to cultivated species of the 
phyla Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Fibrobacteres, 
Gemmatimonadetes and Lentisphaerae.

Two novel alkaliphilic aerobic organotrophic bacteria have been isolated from a 
moderately saline and alkaline East African soda lake. The new isolates grow at 
pH values between 6 and 10, with a pH optimum for growth of 9.0, and at a salt 
concentration between 0% and 10% (w/v). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA 
sequence shows that these isolates are very closely related (99.6% similarity) 
and are members of the monospecific genus Dietzia (98.8% and 98.7% similarity). 
DNA/DNA hybridization revealed a relatedness of 83% between the two isolates, 
but only 8% between them and the type strain Dietzia maris. The G + C content as 
measured by thermal denaturation is 66.1 mol%. Phenotypic comparisons between D. 
maris and one isolate showed that they share very similar morphological and 
chemotaxonomic properties, but differ significantly in carbon source utilization 
profiles and halotolerance in alkaline medium. We propose a second species of 
this genus which we name Dietzia natronolimnaios (type strain 15LN1 = CBS 
107.95).

The mummification ritual in ancient Egypt involved the evisceration of the 
corpse and its desiccation using natron, a naturally occurring evaporitic 
mineral deposit from the Wadi Natrun, Egypt. The deposit typically contains 
sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and impurities of chloride and sulfate as 
its major elemental components. It is believed that the function of the natron 
was to rapidly remove the water from the cadaver to prevent microbial attack 
associated with subsequent biological tissue degradation and putrefaction. 
Several specimens of natron that were recently collected from the Wadi Natrun 
contained coloured zones interspersed with the mineral matrix that are 
superficially reminiscent of extremophilic cyanobacterial colonisation found 
elsewhere in hot and cold deserts. Raman spectroscopy of these specimens using 
visible and near-infrared laser excitation has revealed not only the mineral 
composition of the natron, but also evidence for the presence of cyanobacterial 
colonies in several coloured zones observed in the mineral matrix. Key Raman 
biosignatures of carotenoids, scytonemin and chlorophyll have been identified.

Halophilic and halotolerant Gram-negative bacteria are microorganisms which 
thrive in high salt environments. LPS are the major components of their outer 
leaflet, nevertheless very little is known about the role of this molecules in 
the adaptation mechanisms of extremophiles. Recently we determined the O-chain 
repeating unit structure of the LPS from Halomonas alkaliantarctica strain CRSS, 
an haloalkaliphilic Gram-negative bacterium isolated from salt sediments of a 
saline lake in Cape Russell in Antarctic continent. The polysaccharide is 
constituted of the trisaccharidic repeating unit: 
→3)-β-l-Rhap-(1→4)-α-l-Rhap-(1→3)-α-l-Rhap-(1→. In this paper we report the 
complete core LPS structure from this bacterium. The LPS was hydrolyzed both 
under mild acid and strong alkaline conditions. The MALDI spectra showed the 
presence of two glycoforms. The most abundant was recovered after HPAEC 
purification of the alkaline hydrolyzed product and was characterized by means 
of 2D-NMR spectroscopy. A comparison of the MALDI-PSD spectra of the two 
glycoforms suggested that the branched heptose was not stoichiometrically 
substituted.

The Siberian permafrost is an extreme, yet stable environment due to its 
continuously frozen state. Microbes maintain membrane potential and respiratory 
activity at average temperatures of -10 to -12 degrees C that concentrate 
solutes to an aw=0.90 (5 osm), The isolation of viable Psychrobacter arcticus 
sp. 273-4 and Exiguobacterium sibiricum sp. 255-15 from ancient permafrost 
suggests that these bacteria have maintained some level of metabolic activity 
for thousands of years. Permafrost water activity was simulated using 1/2 
TSB+2.79 m NaCl (5 osm) at and cells were held at 22 and 4 degrees C. Many cells 
reduced cyano-tetrazolium chloride (CTC) indicating functioning electron 
transport systems. Increased membrane permeability was not responsible for this 
lack of electron transport, as more cells were determined to be intact by 
LIVE/DEAD staining than were reducing CTC. Low rates of aerobic respiration were 
determined by the slope of the reduced resazurin line for P. arcticus, and E. 
sibiricum. Tritiated leucine was incorporated into new proteins at rates 
indicating basal level metabolism. The continued membrane potential, electron 
transport and aerobic respiration, coupled with incorporation of radio-labeled 
leucine into cell material when incubated in high osmolarity media, show that 
some of the population is metabolically active under simulated in situ 
conditions.

Eleven psychrophilic bacteria were isolated from a solid layer of fast ice in 
the middle of Pointe-Geologie Archipelago, Adelie Land, Antarctica. The 11 
isolates based on the phenotypic characteristics, chemotaxonomic and 
phylogenetic analysis have been identified as members of the genus Halomonas. 
All the isolates at the 16S rDNA sequence level were identical, possessed the 15 
conserved nucleotides of the family Halomonadaceae and four nucleotides of the 
genus Halomonas. Therefore, the 16S rDNA sequence of DD 39 was used for 
calculating the evolutionary distances and for phylogenetic analysis. It was 
observed that DD 39 formed a robust cluster with H. variabilis, from which it 
differed by 0.7%. Further DNA-DNA hybridization studies indicated low DNA-DNA 
homology (15%) between H. variabilis and DD 39. Between the 11 Antarctic 
isolates the homology was >85%. In addition it was observed that DD 39 was 
different from H. variabilis in that it was psychrophilic, could tolerate only 
up to 15% sodium chloride, could not hydrolyse esculin, could not reduce 
nitrate, was urease negative, could not utilize glycerol as a carbon source, and 
was resistant to ampicillin and erythromycin and sensitive to nalidixic acid. In 
addition, it also exhibited distinct differences with respect to high content of 
C(16:1) and low levels of cyclo-C(17:0) and cyclo-C(19:0). DD 39 also differed 
from all the other reported species of Halomonas with respect to many phenotypic 
characteristics. It is proposed therefore that DD 39 should be placed in the 
genus Halomonas as a new species that is Halomonas glaciei. The type strain of 
H. glaciei is DD 39(T) (MTCC 4321; JCM 11692).

Four new isolates were obtained from denitrifying enrichments with various 
electron donors using sediment samples from hypersaline soda lakes. Based on 16S 
rRNA gene analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization results, they were all identified 
as members of the Gammaproteobacteria closely associated with the 
Alkalispirillum-Alkalilimnicola group. Two isolates were obtained from samples 
enriched with nitrate as electron acceptor and H2 or polysulfide as electron 
donors, and another two strains were obtained with N2O as the electron acceptor 
and sulfide or acetate as electron donors. All four new isolates, together with 
the type strains of the genera Alkalispirillum and Alkalilimnicola originally 
described as obligate aerobes, were capable of anaerobic growth with acetate 
using either nitrate or N2O as electron acceptors. Their denitrification 
pathway, however, was disrupted at the level of nitrite. RuBisCO form I gene was 
detected and sequenced in the new isolates and in Alkalilimnicola halodurans but 
not in Alkalispirillum mobile. These data, together with the evidence of 
Oremland et al. (Appl Environ Microbiol 68:4795-4802, 2002) on the potential of 
Alkalilimnicola sp. MLHE-1 for autotrophic growth with arsenite as electron 
donor and nitrate as electron acceptor, demonstrate much higher metabolic 
diversity of this specific group of haloalkaliphilic Gammaproteobacteria than 
was originally anticipated.

Searles Lake occupies a closed basin harboring salt-saturated, alkaline brines 
that have exceptionally high concentrations of arsenic oxyanions. Strain 
SLAS-1(T) was previously isolated from Searles Lake (R. S. Oremland, T. R. Kulp, 
J. Switzer Blum, S. E. Hoeft, S. Baesman, L. G. Miller, and J. F. Stolz, Science 
308:1305-1308, 2005). We now describe this extremophile with regard to its 
substrate affinities, its unusual mode of motility, sequenced arrABD gene 
cluster, cell envelope lipids, and its phylogenetic alignment within the order 
Halanaerobacteriales, assigning it the name ""Halarsenatibacter silvermanii"" 
strain SLAS-1(T). We also report on the substrate dynamics of an anaerobic 
enrichment culture obtained from Searles Lake that grows under conditions of 
salt saturation and whose members include a novel sulfate reducer of the order 
Desulfovibriales, the archaeon Halorhabdus utahensis, as well as a close homolog 
of strain SLAS-1(T).

The literature presents the preserving effect of biological coatings developed 
from various microbial sources. However, the presented work exhibits its 
uniqueness in the utilization of halophilic exopolysaccharides as food coating 
material. Moreover, such extremophilic exopolysaccharides are more stable and 
economical production is possible. Consequently, the aim of the presented 
research was to develop a coating material from marine exopolysaccharide (EPS). 
The significant EPS producers having antagonistic attributes against selected 
phytopathogens were screened from different marine water and soil samples. 
TSIS01 isolate revealed the maximum antagonism well and EPS production was 
selected further and characterized as Bacillus tequilensis MS01 by 16S rRNA 
analysis. EPS production was optimized and deproteinized EPS was assessed for 
biophysical properties. High performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) 
analysis revealed that EPS was a heteropolymer of glucose, galactose, mannose, 
and glucuronic acid. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, 
and UV-visible spectra validated the presence of determined sugars. It showed 
high stability at a wide range of temperatures, pH and incubation time, ≈1.63 × 
106 Da molecular weight, intermediate solubility index (48.2 ± 3.12%), low water 
holding capacity (12.4 ± 1.93%), and pseudoplastic rheologic shear-thinning 
comparable to xanthan gum. It revealed antimicrobial potential against human 
pathogens and antioxidants as well as anti-inflammatory potential. The 
biocontrol assay of EPS against phytopathogens revealed the highest activity 
against Alternaria solani. The EPS-coated and control tomato fruits were treated 
with A. solani suspension to check the % disease incidence, which revealed a 
significant (p < 0.001) decline compared to uncoated controls. Moreover, it 
revealed shelf-life prolonging action on tomatoes comparable to xanthan gum and 
higher than chitosan. Consequently, the presented marine EPS was elucidated as a 
potent coating material to mitigate post-harvest losses.

The celX gene encoding an extracellular cold-active cellulase was isolated from 
a psychrotrophic bacterium, which was isolated from deep-sea sediment and 
identified as a Pseudoalteromonas species. It encoded a protein consisting of 
492 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 52.7 kDa. The CelX consisted 
of an N-terminal catalytic domain belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 5 and 
a C-terminal cellulose-binding domain belonging to carbohydrate-binding module 
family 5. The long linker sequence connecting both domains was composed of 105 
residues. The optimal temperature for cellulase activity of CelX was 40 degrees 
C. The enzyme was most active at pH 6-7 and showed better resistance to alkaline 
condition. The zymogram activity analysis indicated that the CelX consisted of 
single enzyme component. The cellobiose was main hydrolysate of CelX.

NaCl alleviates Cd toxicity in Sesvium portulacastrum by maintaining plant water 
status and redox balance, protecting chloroplasts structure and inducing some 
potential Cd (2+) chelators as GSH and proline. It has been demonstrated that 
NaCl alleviates Cd-induced growth inhibition in the halophyte Sesuvium 
portulacastrum. However, the processes that mediate this effect are still 
unclear. In this work we combined physiological, biochemical and ultrastructural 
studies to highlight the effects of salt on the redox balance and photosynthesis 
in Cd-stressed plants. Seedlings were exposed to different Cd concentrations (0, 
25 and 50 µM Cd) combined with low (0.09 mM) (LS), or high (200 mM) NaCl (HS) in 
hydroponic culture. Plant-water relations, photosynthesis rate, leaf gas 
exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, chloroplast ultrastructure, and proline and 
glutathione concentrations were analyzed after 1 month of treatment. In 
addition, the endogenous levels of stress-related hormones were determined in 
plants subjected to 25 µM Cd combined with both NaCl concentrations. In plants 
with low salt supply (LS), Cd reduced growth, induced plant dehydration, 
disrupted chloroplast structure and functioning, decreased net CO2 assimilation 
rate (A) and transpiration rate (E), inhibited the maximum potential quantum 
efficiency (Fv/Fm) and the quantum yield efficiency (Φ PSII) of PSII, and 
enhanced the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). The addition of 200 mM NaCl (HS) 
to the Cd-containing medium culture significantly mitigated Cd phytotoxicity. 
Hence, even at similar internal Cd concentrations, HS-Cd plants were less 
affected by Cd than LS-Cd ones. Hence, 200 mM NaCl significantly alleviates 
Cd-induced toxicity symptoms, growth inhibition, and photosynthesis 
disturbances. The cell ultrastructure was better preserved in HS-Cd plants but 
affected in LS-Cd plants. The HS-Cd plants showed also higher concentrations of 
reduced glutathione (GSH), proline and jasmonic acid (JA) than the LS-Cd plants. 
However, under LS-Cd conditions, plants maintained higher concentration of 
salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA) than the HS-Cd ones. We conclude 
that in S. portulacastrum alleviation of Cd toxicity by NaCl is related to the 
modification of GSH and proline contents as well as stress hormone levels thus 
protecting redox balance and photosynthesis.

Permafrost represents a unique ecosystem that has allowed the prolonged survival 
of certain bacterial lineages at subzero temperatures. To better understand the 
permafrost microbial community, it is important to identify isolation protocols 
that optimize the recovery of genetically diverse bacterial lineages. We have 
investigated the impact of different low-temperature isolation protocols on 
recovery of aerobic bacteria from northeast Siberian permafrost of variable 
geologic origin and frozen for 5000 to 3 million years. Low-nutrient media 
enhanced the quantitative recovery of bacteria, whereas the isolation of diverse 
morphotypes was maximized on rich media. Cold enrichments done directly in 
natural, undisturbed permafrost led not only to recovery of increased numbers of 
bacteria but also to isolation of genotypes not recovered by means of liquid 
low-temperature enrichments. On the other hand, direct plating and growth at 4 
degrees C also led to recovery of diverse genotypes, some of which were not 
recovered following enrichment. Strains recovered from different permafrost 
samples were predominantly oligotrophic and non-spore-forming but were otherwise 
variable from each other in terms of a number of bacteriological 
characteristics. Our data suggest that a combination of isolation protocols from 
different permafrost samples should be used to establish a culture-based survey 
of the different bacterial lineages in permafrost.

A thermophilic bacterium, designated as RH 127, was isolated from mud volcano 
(Baratang Islands) of Andaman region, India (12°07'N 92°47'E/12.117°N 92.783°E) 
for the first time. Biochemical tests and 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicate that 
it belongs to the genus Geobacillus. The strain showed 98% confirmed 16S rRNA 
gene sequence homology with Geobacillus toebii. The bacteria was extracted in 
various solvent systems and three different fractions prepared. In the present 
study, antioxidant and radioprotective activity of extracts (INM-7860, INM-7861, 
and INM-7862) of bacterium G. toebii (strain RH 127) were evaluated. The 
fractions were evaluated for their introspective comparison of the relative 
antioxidant efficiency. The antioxidative activities, DPPH radical scavenging 
effects, hydroxyl radical scavenging effects, membrane protection, antihemolytic 
activity, and linoleic acid degradation efficacies were assayed. INM-7861 and 
INM-7862 activated NF-κB expression, as evidenced by reporter assay studies, and 
thereby contributed to overall radioprotective effect. INM-7862 exhibited best 
results. This study explicitly shows that the extracts of G. toebii have immense 
potential as a radiation countermeasure agent.

Gaseous phase hydration effect of extremely dehydrated thallus of the Antarctic 
lichenized fungus Turgidosculum complicatulum and of green alga Prasiola crispa 
was observed using hydration kinetics, sorption isotherm, 1H-NMR spectroscopy 
and relaxometry. Three bound water fractions were distinguished: (1) very 
tightly bound water, (2) tightly bound water and (3) a loosely bound water 
fraction detected at higher levels of hydration. Sorption isotherm was sigmoidal 
in form and well fitted using Dent model. The relative mass of water saturating 
primary water binding sites was ΔM/m 0 = 0.055 for T. complicatulum and ΔM/m 
0 = 0.131 for P. crispa. 1H-NMR free induction decays (FIDs) for T. 
complicatulum and for P. crispa were superpositions of a solid signal component, 
and one averaged liquid signal component for P. crispa thallus ([Formula: see 
text] ≈ 80 µs) or two liquid signal components coming from a tightly bound 
([Formula: see text]≈ 71 µs) and from a loosely bound water fraction ([Formula: 
see text]≈ 278 µs) for T. complicatulum. 1H-NMR spectra recorded for T. 
complicatulum and for P. crispa thalli revealed one averaged mobile proton 
signal component L. The total liquid signal component expressed in units of 
solid (L 1 + L 2)/S suggests the presence of water soluble fraction in T. 
complicatulum thallus.

In this work, we investigate the physiological responses to P deficiency (5μM 
KH2PO4=D), salt stress (400mM NaCl=C+S), and their combination (D+S) on the 
facultative halophyte Aeluropus littoralis to understand how plants adapt to 
these combined stresses. When individually applied, both P deficiency and 
salinity significantly restricted whole plant growth, with a more marked effect 
of the latter stress. However, the effects of the two stresses were not additive 
in plant biomass production since the response of plants to combined salinity 
and P deficiency was similar to that of plants grown under salt stress alone. In 
addition the observed features under salinity alone are kept when plants are 
simultaneously subjected to the combined effects of salinity and P deficiency 
such as biomass partitioning; the synthesis of proline and the K(+)/Na(+) 
selectivity ratio. Thus, increasing P availability under saline conditions has 
no significant effect on salt tolerance in this species. Plants cultivated under 
the combined effects of salinity and P deficiency exhibited the lowest leaf 
water potential. This trend was associated with a high accumulation of Na(+), 
Cl(-) and proline in shoots of salt treated plants suggesting the involvement of 
these solutes in osmotic adjustment. Proline could be involved in other 
physiological processes such as free radical scavenging. Furthermore, salinity 
has no significant effect on phosphorus acquisition when combined with a low P 
supply and it significantly decreased this parameter when combined with a 
sufficient P supply. This fact was probably due to salt's effect on P 
transporters. In addition, shoot soluble sugars accumulation under both P 
deficiency treatments with and without salt likely play an important role in the 
adaptation of A. littoralis plants to P shortage applied alone or combined with 
salinity. Moreover, there was a strong correlation between shoot and root 
intracellular acid phosphatase activity and phosphorus use efficiency which 
strengthens the assumption that intracellular acid phosphatase enzymes are 
involved in P remobilization in this species. Finally, our results showed that P 
availability has no significant effect on salt excretion in A. littorlais which 
suggests that independently of the P status in the plant, excretion remains 
priority over other functions requiring energy such as growth. This result could 
also indicate that salt excretion is not energy-dependent in this species.

The interactive effects of salinity and phosphorus availability on growth, water 
relations, nutritional status and photosynthetic activity were investigated in 
barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Manel). Seedlings were grown hydroponically under 
low or sufficient phosphorus (P) supply (5 or 180 μmol KH(2) PO(4) plant(-1) 
week(-1) , respectively), with or without 100 mm NaCl. Phosphorus deficiency or 
salinity significantly decreased whole plant growth, leaf water content, leaf 
osmotic potential and gas exchange parameters, with a more marked impact of P 
stress. The effect of both stresses was not additive since the response of 
plants to combined salinity and P deficiency was similar to that of plants grown 
under P deficiency alone. In addition, salt-treated plants exposed to P 
deficiency showed higher salt tolerance compared to plants grown with sufficient 
P supply. This was related to plant ability to significantly increase root:shoot 
DW ratio, root length, K(+)/Na(+) ratio, leaf proline and soluble sugar 
concentrations and total non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity, together with 
restricting Na(+) accumulation in the upper leaves. As a whole, our results 
indicate that under concomitant exposure to both salt and P deficiency, the 
impact of the latter constraint is pre-dominant.

Here, we combined flow cytometry (FCM) and phylogenetic analyses after cell 
sorting to characterize the dominant groups of the prokaryotic assemblages 
inhabiting two ponds of increasing salinity: a crystallizer pond (TS) with a 
salinity of 390 g/L, and the non-crystallizer pond (M1) with a salinity of 
200 g/L retrieved from the solar saltern of Sfax in Tunisia. As expected, FCM 
analysis enabled the resolution of high nucleic acid content (HNA) and low 
nucleic acid content (LNA) prokaryotes. Next, we performed a taxonomic analysis 
of the bacterial and archaeal communities comprising the two most populated 
clusters by phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene clone library. We show for 
the first time that the presence of HNA and LNA content cells could also be 
extended to the archaeal populations. Archaea were detected in all M1 and TS 
samples, whereas representatives of Bacteria were detected only in LNA for M1 
and HNA for TS. Although most of the archaeal sequences remained undetermined, 
other clones were most frequently affiliated to Haloquadratum and Halorubrum. In 
contrast, most bacterial clones belonged to the Alphaproteobacteria class 
(Phyllobacterium genus) in M1 samples and to the Bacteroidetes phylum 
(Sphingobacteria and Salinibacter genus) in TS samples.

Microbial proteolytic enzyme is one of the most important industrial enzymes 
that hydrolyze proteins. The applications of proteases under harsh industrial 
conditions like alkalinity, salinity, and temperature make them inactive and 
unstable. This suggests need for search for novel microbial sources for protease 
production having diverse properties. For this purpose, 54 bacterial strains 
were isolated from different salt mines of Karak, Pakistan and were investigated 
for their proteolytic activity on skim milk agar plates. The strain which showed 
maximum protease activity was characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. 
Furthermore, growth and protease production was optimized for the characterized 
bacteria under different physical factors, i.e., pH, temperature and salinity. 
The isolate BLK-1.5 exhibited strong protease production and was identified as 
Bacillus subtilis based on biochemical characteristics and 16S rRNA gene 
sequence analysis. Maximum production of protease was recorded at pH 10, 37 °C 
and 7 % (w/v) NaCl. Molecular weight of proteases was estimated 38 kDa and its 
optimum activity was observed at pH 10, 50 °C and 2 % (w/v) NaCl. In conclusion, 
the protease produced by halo-tolerant Bacillus subtilis strain BLK-1.5 has 
diverse characteristics and could be useful in various industrial applications.

GD-95 lipase from Geobacillus sp. strain 95 and its modified variants lacking 
N-terminal signal peptide and/or 10 or 20 C-terminal amino acids were 
successfully cloned, expressed and purified. To our knowledge, GD-95 lipase 
precursor (Pre-GD-95) is the first Geobacillus lipase possessing more than 80% 
lipolytic activity at 5 °C. It has maximum activity at 55 °C and displays a 
broad pH activity range. GD-95 lipase was shown to hydrolyze p-NP dodecanoate, 
tricaprylin and canola oil better than other analyzed substrates. Structural and 
sequence alignments of bacterial lipases and GD-95 lipase revealed that the 
C-terminus forms an α helix, which is a conserved structure in lipases from 
Pseudomonas, Clostridium or Staphylococcus bacteria. This work demonstrates that 
10 and 20 C-terminal amino acids of GD-95 lipase significantly affect stability 
and other physicochemical properties of this enzyme, which has never been 
reported before and can help create lipases with more specific properties for 
industrial application. GD-95 lipase and its modified variants GD-95-10 can be 
successfully applied to biofuel production, in leather and pulp industries, for 
the production of cosmetics or perfumes. These lipases are potential 
biocatalysts in processes, which require extreme conditions: low or high 
temperature, strongly acidic or alkaline environment and various organic 
solvents.

Samples of sediments and surrounding soda soils (SS) from the extremely saline 
and alkaline lakes of the Wadi el Natrun in the Libyan Desert, Egypt, were 
obtained in October 2000. Anaerobic enrichment cultures were grown from these 
samples, DNA isolated, and the bacterial diversity assessed by 16S rRNA gene 
clone analysis. Clones derived from lake sediments (LS) most closely matched 
Clostridium spp., Natronoincola histidinovorans, Halocella cellulolytica, 
Bacillus spp., and the Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides group. Similar clones 
were identified in the SS, but Bacillus spp. predominated. Many of the clones 
were most closely related to organisms already identified in alkaline or saline 
environments. Two genomic DNA libraries were made from the pooled LS enrichments 
and a single SS-enrichment sample. A novel cellulase activity was identified and 
characterized in each. The lake cellulase ORF encoded a protein of 1,118 amino 
acids; BLASTP analysis showed it was most closely related to an endoglucanase 
from Xanthomonas campestris. The soil-cellulase ORF encoded a protein of 634 
amino acids that was most closely related to an endoglucanase from Fibrobacter 
succinogenes.

The exposure of fresh sulfide-rich lithologies by the retracement of the Nevado 
Pastoruri glacier (Central Andes, Perú) is increasing the presence of heavy 
metals in the water as well as decreasing the pH, producing an acid rock 
drainage (ARD) process in the area. We describe the microbial communities of an 
extreme ARD site in Huascarán National Park as well as their correlation with 
the water physicochemistry. Microbial biodiversity was analyzed by FLX 454 
sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The suggested geomicrobiological model of the 
area distinguishes three different zones. The proglacial zone is located in the 
upper part of the valley, where the ARD process is not evident yet. Most of the 
OTUs detected in this area were related to sequences associated with cold 
environments (i.e., psychrotolerant species of Cyanobacteria or Bacteroidetes). 
After the proglacial area, an ARD-influenced zone appeared, characterized by the 
presence of phylotypes related to acidophiles (Acidiphilium) as well as other 
species related to acidic and cold environments (i.e., acidophilic species of 
Chloroflexi, Clostridium and Verrumicrobia). Sulfur- and iron-oxidizing 
acidophilic bacteria (Acidithiobacillus) were also identified. The post-ARD area 
was characterized by the presence of OTUs related to microorganisms detected in 
soils, permafrost, high mountain environments, and deglaciation areas 
(Sphingomonadales, Caulobacter or Comamonadaceae).

Na(V)BP, found in alkaliphilic Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4, is a member of the 
bacterial voltage-gated Na(+) channel superfamily. The alkaliphile requires 
Na(V)BP for normal chemotaxis responses and for optimal pH homeostasis during a 
shift to alkaline conditions at suboptimally low Na(+) concentrations. We 
hypothesized that interaction of Na(V)BP with one or more other proteins in 
vivo, specifically methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), is involved in 
activation of the channel under the pH conditions that exist in the extremophile 
and could underpin its role in chemotaxis; MCPs transduce chemotactic signals 
and generally localize to cell poles of rod-shaped cells. Here, 
immunofluorescence microscopy and fluorescent protein fusion studies showed that 
an alkaliphile protein (designated McpX) that cross-reacts with antibodies 
raised against Bacillus subtilis McpB co-localizes with Na(V)BP at the cell 
poles of B. pseudofirmus OF4. In a mutant in which Na(V)BP-encoding ncbA is 
deleted, the content of McpX was close to the wild-type level but McpX was 
significantly delocalized. A mutant of B. pseudofirmus OF4 was constructed in 
which cheAW expression was disrupted to assess whether this mutation impaired 
polar localization of McpX, as expected from studies in Escherichia coli and 
Salmonella, and, if so, whether Na(V)BP would be similarly affected. Polar 
localization of both McpX and Na(V)BP was decreased in the cheAW mutant. The 
results suggest interactions between McpX and Na(V)BP that affect their 
co-localization. The inverse chemotaxis phenotype of ncbA mutants may result in 
part from MCP delocalization.

The proteome of the radiation- and desiccation-resistant bacterium D. 
radiodurans features a group of proteins that contain significant intrinsically 
disordered regions that are not present in non-extremophile homologues. 
Interestingly, this group includes a number of housekeeping and repair proteins 
such as DNA polymerase III, nudix hydrolase and rotamase. Here, we focus on a 
member of the nudix hydrolase family from D. radiodurans possessing 
low-complexity N- and C-terminal tails, which exhibit sequence signatures of 
intrinsic disorder and have unknown function. The enzyme catalyzes the 
hydrolysis of oxidatively damaged and mutagenic nucleotides, and it is thought 
to play an important role in D. radiodurans during the recovery phase after 
exposure to ionizing radiation or desiccation. We use molecular dynamics 
simulations to study the dynamics of the protein, and study its hydration free 
energy using the GB/SA formalism. We show that the presence of disordered tails 
significantly decreases the hydration free energy of the whole protein. We 
hypothesize that the tails increase the chances of the protein to be located in 
the remaining water patches in the desiccated cell, where it is protected from 
the desiccation effects and can function normally. We extrapolate this to other 
intrinsically disordered regions in proteins, and propose a novel function for 
them: intrinsically disordered regions increase the ""surface-properties"" of the 
folded domains they are attached to, making them on the whole more hydrophilic 
and potentially influencing, in this way, their localization and cellular 
activity.

The thermophilic glycolytic anaerobe Thermoanaerobacter wiegelii grows over the 
pH range 5.1-7.7, and no growth is observed below pH 5.0 or above 7.7. When T. 
wiegelii was grown in pH-uncontrolled batch culture, glucose was fermented to 
ethanol, acetate, and lactate. Small amounts of lactic acid were produced once 
the external pH reached 6.0, and a fructose-1.6-diphosphate (FDP) activated 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was detected in cell-free crude extracts. Maximal 
activation of LDH by FDP was observed at pH 6.2. As the pH of the medium 
declined from 6.7 to 5.1 due to the production of acetate and lactate, the total 
protonmotive force (deltap) remained between - 110 and - 130mV, and the membrane 
potential (dekltapsi) decreased from -104 to -65mV. This decrease in deltapsi 
was paralleled by an increase in the chemical gradient of protons (ZdeltapH) 
from -31 to -62mV at pH 5.1. Based on these results, T. wiegelii maintained a 
small deltapH (0.3-0.9 units, inside alkaline) as the medium pH declined and 
interconverted deltapsi to ZdeltapH to maintain the total deltap relatively 
constant. Intracellular potassium decreased from 150 mM at pH 6.70 to 50 mM at 
pH 5.1, and this represented a 33-mV decline in the transmembrane chemical 
potential of potassium. The ability to synthesize ATP remained constant as the 
external pH declined, and therefore metabolic energy per se was not a critical 
aspect of pH sensitivity.

In this study we investigated the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide 
dismutases (SODs) and catalases (CATs)) and the ROS level in cells of Yarrowia 
lipolytica yeasts grown in a medium with different pH values (4.5, 5.5 and 9.0). 
It was shown that an increase in the cellular ROS level took place under both 
acid and alkaline conditions. The growth under extreme conditions was 
accompanied by a significant increase of SOD activity (by 2.5 times in the acid 
medium and by 4 times in the alkaline medium), but catalase activity did not 
change. A study of the electrophoretic profile of catalases showed the presence 
of three isoforms differing in inhibitor resistance. The electrophoretic 
profiles of SODs and their inhibitory analysis revealed there are two other 
isoforms, probably of mitochondrial origin, in addition to Cu and Zn SOD. The 
role of SOD in pH-adaptation of extremophilic Y. lipolytica yeasts is discussed.

The ribosomal RNA operons (rrn) of alkaliphilic Bacillus halodurans C-125 were 
characterized and compared with those of B. subtilis. We isolated clones 
containing rrn operons from a lambda phage library of the C-125 chromosome, and 
the complete nucleotide sequence of each was determined. Eight rrn operons were 
identified by PFGE analysis of the C-125 chromosome digested with I-CeuI. The 
transcriptional orientation of the rrn operons mapped on the chromosome by 
Southern hybridization analysis was the same as the direction of replication of 
the chromosome. These operons were designated as rrnA-H, starting from the oriC 
locus in clockwise rotation. Sequence and structural analyses of these operons 
suggested that six of the rrn operons in the C-125 chromosome, rrnA, rrnB, 
rrnC-rrnD, rrnE, and rrnH, correspond to rrnO, rrnA, rrnJ-rrnW, rrnI, and rrnD 
in B. subtilis, whereas the other rrn operons (rrnF and rrnG) were specifically 
observed in C-125. The rrn loci were positioned from 0 degrees to 90 degrees on 
the physical map, with the oriC locus assigned the position zero degrees. Two 
ORFs annotated as tnpA and ykfC, whose gene products are likely to act as 
transposases, were found downstream of these six operons. Comparative analysis 
of the 16S-23S and 23S-5S ITS (internally transcribed sequence) regions of B. 
halodurans C-125 and those of B. subtilis revealed that the ITS regions in C-125 
were much longer than those in B. subtilis. There was no substantial difference 
in the length of potential promoter sequences in B. halodurans and B. subtilis.

Molecular dynamics simulations of an archaeal membrane made up of bipolar 
tetraether lipids and a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipid membrane 
were performed and compared for the first time. The simulated archaeal membrane 
consists of a pure monolayer of asymmetrical lipids, analogous to the main polar 
lipid [MPL; Swain, M., Brisson, J.-R., Sprott, G.D., Cooper, F.P., and Patel, 
G.B., (1997) Identification of beta-L-Gulose as the Sugar Moiety of the Main 
Polar Lipid of Thermoplasma acidophilum, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1345, 56-64] 
found in T. acidophilum, an extremophile archaeal organism. This simulated 
membrane lipid contains two cyclopentane rings located on one of the two 
aliphatic chains of the lipid. The archaeal membrane is simulated at 62degreesC, 
slightly above the optimal growth temperature of T. acidophilum. We compared the 
organization of this tetraether lipid monolayer with a DPPC bilayer simulated at 
50degreesC, both of them being modeled in a partially hydrated state. Our 
results assess the singularity of the tetraether lipid organization, in 
particular the influence of the spanning structure on the molecular ordering 
within the archaeal membrane.

A novel Gram-positive facultatively alkaliphilic, sporulating, rod-shaped 
bacterium, designated as WW3-SN6, has been isolated from the alkaline washwaters 
derived from the preparation of edible olives. The bacterium is nonmotile, and 
flagella are not observed. It is oxidase positive and catalase negative. The 
facultative alkaliphile grows from pH 7.0 to 10.5, with a broad optimum from pH 
8.0 to 9.0. It could grow in up to 15% (w/v) NaCl, and over the temperature 
range from 4 degrees to 37 degrees C, with an optimum between 27 degrees and 32 
degrees C: therefore, it is both halotolerant and psychrotolerant. The bacterium 
is sensitive to a range of beta-lactam, sulfonamide, and aminoglycoside 
antibiotics, but resistant to trimethoprim. The range of amino acids, sugars, 
and polyols utilized as growth substrates indicates that this alkaliphile is a 
heterotrophic bacterium. D(+)-glucose, D(+)-glucose-6-phosphate, 
D(+)-cellobiose, starch, or sucrose are the substrates best utilized. The major 
membrane lipids are phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol, with 
smaller amounts of phosphatidylethanolamine and an unknown phospholipid. During 
growth at high pH, the proportion of phosphatidylglycerol is increased relative 
to phosphatidylethanolamine. The fatty acyl components in the membrane 
phospholipids are mainly branched chain, with 13-methyl tetradecanoic and 
12-methyl tetradecanoic acids as the predominant components. The G + C content 
of the genomic DNA is 41.1 +/- 1.0 mol%. The results of 16S ribosomal RNA 
sequence analysis place this alkaliphilic bacterium in a cluster, together with 
an unnamed alkaliphilic Bacillus species (98.2% similarity).

We cloned two genes for alkaline pectate lyase, pel-4A and pel-4B, from alkaline 
pectinase-producing alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain P-4-N. The pel-4B gene 
product Pel-4B was purified to homogeneity and characterized. The purified 
enzyme had an isoelectric point of pH 9.6 and a molecular mass of 35 kDa, values 
close to those of the pel-4A gene product Pel-4A. The pH and temperature optima 
for activity were as high as 11.5 and 70 degrees C, respectively, which are the 
highest among the pectate lyases reported to date. The mature Pel-4B (304 amino 
acids; 33,868 Da) was structurally related to the enzymes in the polysaccharide 
lyase family 1 and showed 35.6% identity with Pel-4A on the amino acid level. It 
showed significant homology to other pectate lyases in the same family, such as 
the enzymes from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strains KSM-P7 and KSM-P103 and the 
fungi Aspergillus nidulans and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. sp. malvae.

Three novel isolates of haloalkaliphilic archaea, strains IHC-005T, IHC-010, and 
N-1311T, from soda lakes in Inner Mongolia, China, were characterized to 
elucidate their taxonomic positions. The three strains were aerobic, 
Gram-negative chemoorganotrophs growing optimally at 37-45 degrees C, pH 
9.0-9.5, and 15-20% NaCl. Cells of strains IHC-005T/IHC-010 were motile rods, 
while those of strain N-1311T were non-motile pleomorphic flats or cocci. The 
three strains contained diphytanyl and phytanyl-sesterterpanyl diether 
derivatives of phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerophosphate methyl 
ester. No glycolipids were detected. On phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene 
sequences, they formed an independent cluster in the Natro group of the family 
Halobacteriaceae. Comparison of their morphological, physiological, and 
biochemical properties, DNA G + C content and 16S rRNA gene sequences, and 
DNA-DNA hybridization study support the view that strains IHC-005T/IHC-010 and 
strain N-1311T represent separate species. Therefore, we propose 
Natronolimnobius baerhuensis gen. nov., sp. nov. for strains IHC-005T (=CGMCC

Two hydrothermal springs (AI: 51 °C, pH 3; AIV: 92 °C, pH 8) were analysed to 
determine prokaryotic community composition. Using pyrosequencing, 93,576 
partial 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified with V2/V3-specific primers for 
Bacteria and Archaea were investigated and compared to 16S rRNA gene sequences 
from direct metagenome sequencing without prior amplification. The results were 
evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). While in site AIV 
Bacteria and Archaea were detected in similar relative abundances (Bacteria 
40 %, Archaea 35 %), the acidic spring AI was dominated by Bacteria (68 %). In 
spring AIV the combination of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and FISH revealed 
high abundance (>50 %) of heterotrophic bacterial genera like 
Caldicellulosiruptor, Dictyoglomus, and Fervidobacterium. In addition, 
chemolithoautotrophic Aquificales were detected in the bacterial community with 
Sulfurihydrogenibium being the dominant genus. Regarding Archaea, only 
Crenarchaeota, were detected, dominated by the family Desulfurococcaceae 
(>50 %). In addition, Thermoproteaceae made up almost 25 %. In the acidic spring 
(AI) prokaryotic diversity was lower than in the hot, slightly alkaline spring 
AIV. The bacterial community of site AI was dominated by organisms related to 
the chemolithoautotrophic genus Acidithiobacillus (43 %), to the heterotrophic 
Acidicaldus (38 %) and to Anoxybacillus (7.8 %). This study reveals differences 
in the relative abundance of heterotrophic versus autotrophic microorganisms as 
compared to other hydrothermal habitats. Furthermore, it shows how different 
methods to analyse prokaryotic communities in complex ecosystems can complement 
each other to obtain an in-depth picture of the taxonomic composition and 
diversity within these hydrothermal springs.

The genes of cytochrome bd-encoding cydAB were identified from a deep-sea 
bacterium Shewanella violacea DSS12. These showed significant homologies with 
known cydAB gene sequences from various organisms. Additionally, highly 
conserved regions that are important for the enzymatic function were also 
conserved in cydA of S. violacea. Based on the results, transcriptional analysis 
of cydAB operon and cydDC operon (required for assembly of cytochrome bd) of S. 
violacea in microaerobic condition was performed under the growth condition of 
various pressures. The gene of cydA was expressed even under the condition of 
atmospheric pressure and its expression was enhanced with pressurization. On the 
other hand, the expression of cydC was strongly depressed under the condition of 
atmospheric pressure compared with the case under high pressure. It appeared 
spectrophotometrically that loss of cytochrome bd in S. violacea under 
atmospheric pressure shown in previous study is caused mainly by the loss of 
cydDC. Further, under the growth condition of atmospheric pressure, either less 
amount or no d-type cytochrome was expressed compared with the case of 
high-pressure condition even if the organism was grown under alkaline condition 
or in the presence of uncoupler, which are the inducible condition of d-type 
cytochrome in Escherichia coli. These results suggested that the significant 
amount of d-type cytochrome expression is specific event under the growth 
condition of high pressure.

OBJECTIVE: To isolate and characterize alkaliphilic bacteria with protease 
activity.
METHODS: Protease-producing alkaliphiles were isolated by skim milk agar method. 
The morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics, 16S rRNA gene 
sequence and DNA-DNA hybridization were determined to identify the taxonomic 
position of strain ZL223. Meanwhile, the enzyme characterization of the protease 
including optimal temperature and pH range, stability and oxidation resistance 
were tested by using casein hydrolysis test.
RESULTS: A new strain named ZL223 was isolated from Bange Lake in Tibet, China. 
Cells were Gram-positive, spore-forming, motile rods. Growth pH range was from 
7.0 to 10.0, optimum at pH 9.0. Growth temperature range was from 15 degrees C 
to 45 degrees C, optimum at 37 degrees C. The G + C content of DNA was 40.4 
mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the 
strain belonged to the genus Bacillus and most closely related to Bacillus 
pseudofirmus OF4 with 98.6% sequence similarity. DNA-DNA hybridization analysis 
confirmed the close relationship of strain ZL223 with Bacillus pseudofirmu OF4 
(86% relatedness). Strain ZL223 produced extracellular alkaline protease and its 
maximal enzyme activity was observed at 40 degrees C and pH 12.0.
CONCLUSION: Base on polyphasic taxonomy, strain ZL223 was a new member of 
Bacillus pseudofirmus. It produced alkaline protease which was worth further

Facultatively alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain YN-2000 was isolated from an 
indigo ball. Although the strain has been extensively investigated as a 
representative strain of alkaliphilic bacillus, its taxonomic position is not 
yet known. Morphological, biochemical, and physiological characteristics and 
chemotaxonomic properties indicated that the strain was closely related to 
Bacillus cohnii; this was confirmed by the high homology of the 16S rRNA 
sequence and the construction of a phylogenetic tree on the basis of the 16S 
rRNA sequence and DNA-DNA relatedness data. Strain YN-2000 contained a larger 
amount of unsaturated fatty acids compared with Bacillus subtilis and the 
obligate alkaliphile, Bacillus alcalophilus, regardless of its culture pH. When 
the cells were grown at pH 10, the unsaturated fatty acid content and 
anteiso-/iso-branched fatty acid ratio became lower than those at pH 7. This 
result suggests that membrane fluidity decreases when the cells are grown at pH 
10 compared to those of pH 7. In the cells of strain YN-2000 grown at pH 10, the 
cell-surface aspect was rougher, the cell shape was longer, and the cell-surface 
layer was thicker compared with those of the cells grown at pH 7. The 
cell-surface structural change might be related to adaptation to an alkaline 
environment.

OBJECTIVE: To isolate and identify an alkaliphilic mannanase producing 
bacterium, purify and characterize mannanase thereof.
METHODS: Mannanase-producing alkaliphilic bacterium HMTS15 was isolated by 
alkaline agar with konjak from water sample of Hamatai Lake in Inner Mongolia, 
China. The morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics and 16S 
rRNA gene were analyzed to identify the taxonomic position of strain HMTS15. 
Mannanase produced by strain HMTS15 was purified by four steps including 
(NH4)2SO4 precipitation, cellulose DEAE-sepharose, twice Superdex 200. The 
enzyme properties including optimal temperature, optimal pH, thermal stability, 
pH stability, NaCl tolerance, metal ion tolerance, EDTA and SDS tolerance were 
tested.
RESULTS: Strain HMTS15 was Gram-positive rod. Its growth pH ranged from 7.0 to 
11.0 and growth temperature ranged from 10 degrees C to 45 degrees C. The G + C 
content of the DNA was 40 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene 
sequence comparisons indicated that strain HMTS15 was a member of Bacillus. The 
extracellular mannanase from strain HMTS15 was purified as a single band with 
molecular weight of about 45 kD on SDS-PAGE. The optimal catalytic activity was 
showed at 75 degrees C and pH 10. The mananase was stable up to 60 degrees C and 
retained about 60% residual activity at 65 degrees C for 30 min. The ions Fe2+, 
Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Ag+, Hg2+ and EDTA inhibited the acitivity of the mannanase.
CONCLUSION: Polyphasic taxonomy revealed that strain HTMS15 was a new member of 
Bacillus agaradhaerens. The alkaline mannanase produced by strain HMTS15 hold 
the valuable property in stability at high temperature and broad range of pH.

The [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin from the extreme haloarchaeon Halobacterium salinarum is 
stable in high (>1.5 M) salt concentration. At low salt concentration the 
protein exhibits partial unfolding. The kinetics of unfolding was studied in low 
salt and in presence of urea in order to investigate the role of salt ions on 
the stability of the protein. The urea dependent unfolding, monitored by 
fluorescence of the tryptophan residues and circular dichroism, suggests that 
the native protein is stable at neutral pH, is destabilized in both acidic and 
alkaline environment, and involves the formation of kinetic intermediate(s). In 
contrast, the unfolding kinetics in low salt exhibits enhanced rate of unfolding 
with increase in pH value and is a two state process without the formation of 
intermediate. The unfolding at neutral pH is salt concentration dependent and 
occurs in two stages. The first stage, involves an initial fast phase 
(indicative of the formation of a hydrophobic collapsed state) followed by a 
relatively slow phase, and is dependent on the type of cation and anion. The 
second stage is considerably slower, proceeds with an increase in fluorescence 
intensity and is largely independent of the nature of salt. Our results thus 
show that the native form of the haloarchaeal ferredoxin (in high salt 
concentration) unfolds in low salt concentration through an apparently 
hydrophobic collapsed form, which leads to a kinetic intermediate. This 
intermediate then unfolds further to the low salt form of the protein.

A new alkaliphilic and moderately halophilic, strictly anaerobic, fermentative 
bacterium (strain IMP-300(T)) was isolated from a groundwater sample in the zone 
of the former soda lake Texcoco in Mexico. Strain IMP-300(T) was Gram-positive, 
non-sporulated, motile and rod-shaped. It grew within a pH range from 7.5 to 
10.5, and an optimum at 9.5. The organism was obligately dependent on the 
presence of sodium salts. Growth showed an optimum at 35 degrees C with absence 
of growth above 45 degrees C. It fermented peptone and a few amino acids, 
preferentially arginine and ornithine, with production of acetate, propionate, 
and ammonium. Its fatty acid pattern was mainly composed of straight chain 
saturated, unsaturated, and cyclopropane fatty acids. The G + C content of 
genomic DNA was 40.0 mol%. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that 
the new isolate belongs to the genus Tindallia, in the low G + C Gram-positive 
phylum. Phylogenetically, strain IMP-300(T) has Tindallia californiensis, as 
closest relative with a 97.5% similarity level between their 16S rDNA gene 
sequences, but the DNA-DNA re-association value between the two DNAs was only 
42.2%. On the basis of differences in genotypic, phenotypic, and phylogenetic 
characteristics, strain IMP-300(T) is proposed as a new species of the genus 
Tindallia, T. texcoconensis sp. nov. (type strain IMP-300(T ) = DSM 18041(T) = 
JCM 13990(T)).

A possibility of dissimilatory MnO(2) reduction at extremely high salt and pH 
was studied in sediments from hypersaline alkaline lakes in Kulunda Steppe 
(Altai, Russia). Experiments with anaerobic sediment slurries demonstrated a 
relatively rapid reduction of colloidal MnO(2) in the presence of acetate and 
formate as electron donor at in situ conditions (i.e., pH 10 and a salt content 
from 0.6 to 4 M total Na(+)). All reduced Mn at these conditions remained in the 
solid phase. A single, stable enrichment culture was obtained from the slurries 
consistently reducing MnO(2) at pH 10 and 0.6 M total Na(+) with formate. A pure 
culture of a haloalkaliphilic Mn-reducing bacterium obtained from the positive 
enrichment was phylogenetically closely related to the anaerobic 
haloalkaliphilic Bacillus arseniciselenatis isolated from Mono Lake (CA, USA). 
Bacillus sp. strain AMnr1 was obligately anaerobic, able to grow either by 
glucose fermentation, or respiring few nonfermentable substrates by using MnO(2) 
as the electron acceptor. Optimal growth by dissimilatory MnO(2) reduction was 
achieved with glycerol as electron donor at pH 9.5-10 and salt content between 
0.4 and 0.8 M total Na(+).

The binding affinity of the two substrate-water molecules to the water-oxidizing 
Mn₄CaO₅ catalyst in photosystem II core complexes of the extremophilic red alga 
Cyanidioschyzon merolae was studied in the S₂ and S₃ states by the exchange of 
bound ¹⁶O-substrate against ¹⁸O-labeled water. The rate of this exchange was 
detected via the membrane-inlet mass spectrometric analysis of flash-induced 
oxygen evolution. For both redox states a fast and slow phase of water-exchange 
was resolved at the mixed labeled m/z 34 mass peak: kf=52 ± 8s⁻¹ and ks=1.9 ± 
0.3s⁻¹ in the S₂ state, and kf=42 ± 2s⁻¹ and kslow=1.2 ± 0.3s⁻¹ in S₃, 
respectively. Overall these exchange rates are similar to those observed 
previously with preparations of other organisms. The most remarkable finding is 
a significantly slower exchange at the fast substrate-water site in the S₂ 
state, which confirms beyond doubt that both substrate-water molecules are 
already bound in the S2 state. This leads to a very small change of the affinity 
for both the fast and the slowly exchanging substrates during the S₂→S₃ 
transition. Implications for recent models for water-oxidation are briefly 
discussed.

Anaerobranca gottschalkii strain LBS3 T is an extremophile living at high 
temperature (up to 65 degrees C) and in alkaline environments (up to pH 10.5). 
An assembly of 696 DNA contigs representing about 96% of the 2.26-Mbp genome of 
A. gottschalkii has been generated with a low-sequence-coverage 
shotgun-sequencing strategy. The chosen sequencing strategy provided rapid and 
economical access to genes encoding key enzymes of the mono- and polysaccharide 
metabolism, without dilution of spare resources for extensive sequencing of 
genes lacking potential economical value. Five of these amylolytic enzymes of 
considerable commercial interest for biotechnological applications have been 
expressed and characterized in more detail after identification of their genes 
in the partial genome sequence: type I pullulanase, cyclodextrin 
glycosyltransferase (CGTase), two alpha-amylases (AmyA and AmyB), and an 
alpha-1,4-glucan-branching enzyme.

As a model for natural archaebacterial bolalipids, we have synthesized 
omega-hydroxybehenylphosphocholine (HBPC, 
HO-(CH(2))(22)-OP(O(-)(2))O-(CH(2))(2)-N+(CH(3))(3)) and investigated it, by 
Fourier-transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy and differential scanning 
calorimetry, both as fully hydrated dispersions (varying temperature) and as 
aligned films (varying hydration) in terms of particular structural features 
predestining such bipolar lipids for their occurrence in extremophilic 
organisms. The phase behavior of HBPC in dispersions depends on sample 
pretreatment as it comprises metastabilities in annealed samples. However, main 
transition proceeds consistently near 81 degrees C. Some (extra) deal of 
headgroup (phosphate) hydration accompanying a gel-gel phase transition near 66 
degrees C appears to precede chain melting. Studies with HBPC films revealed 
lamellar interdigitated-like solid phases with an extraordinarily strong 
omega-OH--OPO(-) omega-OH--OPO(-) omega-OH hydrogen-bond pattern formed along 
both sides of the resulting monolayers. The ""clamping"" effect inherent to such 
structures provides a clue to explain the relatively high main-transition 
temperature of HBPC assemblies.

The broad host range plasmid pJP4, which carries genes for the degradation of 
2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, and 
3-chlorobenzoic acid, was used in conjugation experiments with mixed cultures 
enriched from water and sediment samples from an alkaline pond in the area of 
Szegedi Fehértó, a soda lake in south Hungary. pJP4-encoded mercury resistance 
was used as a selection marker. One of the transconjugants, the alkaliphilic, 
moderately halophilic strain EF43, stably maintained the plasmid and was able to 
degrade 2,4-D and 3-chlorobenzoate under alkaline conditions in the presence of 
an additional carbon source such as pyruvate, benzoate, or alpha-ketoglutarate, 
indicating that the degradative genes of pJP4 were expressed in this strain. 
However, it was unable to grow on these chloroaromatic substrates when the 
substrate was the sole source of carbon and energy. Chemostat cultivation 
experiments revealed that the 2,4-D degradation rate during growth on benzoate 
or pyruvate was limited by the low activity of chlorocatechol-degrading enzymes, 
particularly chloromuconate cycloisomerase. Strain EF43 was identified as 
Halomonas sp. on the basis of 16S rRNA sequencing and additional taxonomic 
studies. 16S rRNA sequence analysis revealed that strain EF43 is closely related 
to typical soda lake isolates belonging to the genus Halomonas.

Relevance of sequence statistics for the properties of extremophilic proteins.

The amino acid composition of proteins from mesophilic and extremophilic 
organisms is commonly assumed to reflect the mechanisms of molecular adaptation 
to extremes of physical conditions. In this context, halophilic behaviour has 
been attributed to significantly increased numbers of aspartic and glutamic acid 
residues. However, extending the analysis to a statistically relevant set of 
related proteins, dihydrofolate reductase from Halobacterium volcanii, as an 
example, shows that the increase in negative charge is found to be less 
significant than other exchanges of amino acids (e.g., Ala, Asn, Arg, Lys, Phe, 
Ser). Thus, the high water binding capacity of negatively charged residues 
cannot be unambiguously correlated with the anomalous stability of halophilic 
proteins. A similar caveat holds for generalizations regarding the thermal 
stability of proteins. In this case, D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima was compared with a 
number of mesophilic and moderately thermophilic homologs. Again, 'traffic rules 
of stabilization', in terms of amino acid changes in going from mesophilic to 
thermophilic proteins, cannot be given.

Respiratory electron transfer systems in two alkaliphilic Bacillus species, YN-1 
and YN-2000, were investigated In the cyanide-sensitive pathway of the obligate 
alkaliphilic Bacillus YN-1, the terminal enzyme was a caa3-type cytochrome c 
oxidase constituting up to just 10% of the total oxygen-reducing activity, while 
90% of the respiratory activity was due to cyanide-insensitive, nonproteinaceous 
material with a molecular weight of 662. These results were consistent with the 
cyanide-tolerant growth of the bacterium. The molecular and catalytic properties 
of the nonproteinaceous material were not identical with those of menaquinones 
extracted from the bacterium. Furthermore, the nonproteinaceous material was 
also found in the facultative alkaliphilic Bacillus YN-2000, when that bacterium 
was cultivated in alkaline conditions. A new respiratory oxygen-reducing 
mechanism comprising a nonproteinaceous component and a catalase is proposed for 
these alkaliphilic Bacillus species.

We describe an original chaperonin-based reactor that yields folded and active 
proteins from denatured materials. We used the 920-kDa chaperonin of the 
archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, which does not require any protein partner for 
its full activity and assists in vitro folding with low substrate specificity. 
The reactor consists of an ultrafiltration cell equipped with a membrane that 
retains the chaperonin in a functional state for folding in solution and permits 
the flowthrough of the folded substrates. By studying the ATP-dependent 
functional cycle of the chaperonin, we were able to use the reactor for repeated 
refolding processes. The scale-up of the reactor is made possible by the 
overproduction of chaperonin in Sulfolobus solfataricus cells that acquired 
thermotolerance upon appropriate heat shock.

The potentially toxic effects of soluble lanthanide (L) ions, although 
microbially induced mineralization can facilitate the formation of tractable 
materials, has been one factor preventing the more widespread use of L-ions in 
biotechnology. Here, we propose a new mixed-L precursor method as compared to 
the traditional direct addition technique. L (Nd, Gd, Tb, Ho and Er)-substituted 
magnetites, L( y )Fe(3 - y )O(4) were microbially produced using L-mixed 
precursors, L( x )Fe(1 - x )OOH, where x = 0.01-0.2. By combining lanthanides 
into the akaganeite precursor phase, we were able to mitigate some of the 
toxicity, enabling the microbial formation of L-substituted magnetites using a 
metal reducing bacterium, Thermoanaerobacter sp. TOR-39. The employment of 
L-mixed precursors enabled the microbial formation of L-substituted magnetite, 
nominal composition up to L(0.06)Fe(2.94)O(4), with at least tenfold higher 
L-concentration than could be obtained when the lanthanides were added as 
soluble salts. This mixed-precursor method can be used to extend the application 
of microbially produced L-substituted magnetite, while also mitigating their 
toxicity.
