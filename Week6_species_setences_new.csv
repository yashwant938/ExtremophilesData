A. alcalica,40169,36250323,9672858," Using in situ hybridisation, we demonstrate robust, localised gene expression of Rhbg, rhcg1 and rhcg2 in the gill tissue in both A. alcalica embryos and adults, similar to that in other ammoniotelic fish.;  In contrast, the expression of these genes in A. grahami gills is much lower than in A. alcalica, suggesting the rapid evolution of a molecular mechanism underlying the complete ureotelism of A. grahami.; The cichlids of the subgenus Alcolapia, nested within the genus Oreochromis (Ford et al., 2019), are a unique radiation of extremophile fishes found in the East African soda lakes Magadi (A. grahami) and Natron (A. alcalica, A. ndalalani and A. latilabris) (Ford, 2015; Seegers et al., 1999).;  We tested the hypothesis that this feature may be lost after several generations of lab breeding under temperate conditions and found that while lab bred A. alcalica living in the same aquarium excretes some of its waste as ammonia, A. grahami continues to be fully ureotelic.;  We suggest that this differential expression of Rh protein genes provides a molecular mechanism whereby A. grahami does not excrete ammonia and A. alcalica does.;  The data suggest that these genomic regions derive from the same ancestral genomic region and that the A. alcalica genes identified in this work are homologous to those previously studied in zebrafish (Nakada et al., 2007b; Shih et al., 2013), and points to Rhcg2a (rhcgl1) arising from a gene duplication in D. rerio.;  Sequence data for the A. alcalica rhesus protein genes has been submitted to NCBI [accession numbers: {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MW448158"",""term_id"":""1997175937"",""term_text"":""MW448158""}}MW448158 (rhbg), {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MW448159"",""term_id"":""1997175946"",""term_text"":""MW448159""}}MW448159 (rhcg1), {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MW448160"",""term_id"":""1997175960"",""term_text"":""MW448160""}}MW448160 (rhcg2)].; Identification of rhesus protein genes in A. alcalica. (A) Evolutionary relationships among the four Rhesus glycoproteins.; A computationally derived model of the A. alcalica Rhbg protein displays a 12 transmembrane helices structure with a long C-terminal tail; the tail is a feature known to be highly variable within the Amt/Mep/Rh family and has been posited to facilitate a protein–protein interaction in one member from Nitrosomonas europaea (Li et al., 2007; Lupo et al., 2007) (Fig. 2A).;  The model of A. alcalica Rhbg displays high confidence across most of its sequence, with the notable exception of the C-tail, which is to be expected given its divergent sequence across the Rh family.;  The extracellular side of A. alcalica Rhbg contains the highly negatively charged surface characteristic of the Rh family (Fig. 2C).;  In contrast, the intracellular side typically contains a higher prevalence of basic residues, although in A. alcalica the presence of acidic residues at the intracellular pore opening creates a mixed environment (Fig. 2D).;  The structural features predicted by this modelling are consistent with A. alcalica Rhbg acting as an ammonia transporter which we went on to test using two heterologous expression systems.;  The predicted protein structure of A. alcalica Rhbg monomer was generated using AlphaFold as detailed in Jumper et al., 2021. (A) Three dimensional model of Alcolapia Rhbg reveals 12 transmembrane helices and a long C-terminal tail.; To determine whether A. alcalica rhesus proteins are able to move ammonium in vivo, synthetic mRNA coding for A. alcalica Rhbg was injected into zebrafish embryos and ammonia excretion was measured after 24 h.;  Analysis of nitrogenous waste produced by injected and uninjected control embryos shows that overexpression of A. alcalica Rhbg significantly increases the amount ammonia detected in holding water, while the small increase resulting from overexpressing D. rerio Rhbg is not statistically significant (Fig. 3A).;  Ammonia and urea concentration represented as µM of nitrogen are shown for control embryos, embryos injected with 150pg of mRNA coding for D. rerio Rhbg or A. alcalica Rhbg (P-value *<0.05, ns: not significant). (C) Saccharomyces cerevisiae growth on minimal media (pH 6.1) containing NH4 as a sole nitrogen source was measured for 40 h.; To further examine the biological activity of Rhbg proteins from Alcolapia and D. rerio, expression plasmids were generated such that A. alcalica Rhbg and D. rerio Rhbg were constitutively expressed in a S. cerevisiae strain lacking its endogenous Mep ammonium transporters.;  Fig. 3C shows that at 1 mM NH4+ the expression of Rhbg, from both A. alcalica and D. rerio, facilitated growth.; To determine the percentage of nitrogen excreted as either ammonia or urea by A. alcalica, the amount of NH4 and urea in the water holding either adult or embryonic A. alcalica was measured and compared to the same analysis using D. rerio (Fig. 4A and B).;  As expected, both adult and embryonic A. alcalica excreted much more of their nitrogenous waste as urea than D. rerio.;  Adult A. alcalica excreted 64% (n=6) of their nitrogenous waste as urea compared to 14% in adult D. rerio (n=14) (Fig. 4A).;  A. alcalica embryos excreted 79% of their nitrogenous waste as urea (n=7) compared to 18% in D. rerio embryos (n=5) (Fig. 4B).; Nitrogenous waste excreted by ammonotelic D. rerio and ureotelic A. alcalica and A. grahami. (A) Adult D. rerio (N=14) and A. alcalica (N=6) produce significantly different amounts of urea over a 3 h period, where in A. alcalica urea represents over 60% of their nitrogenous waste and in zebrafish this is about 10% (P-value<0.0001 as determined by Student's T test). (B) Embryos at 5 dpf show a similar profile of waste produce over a 6 h period, where A. alcalica embryos (groups of six embryos; N=7 groups) produce significantly more urea than ammonia as waste (∼80%), while only about 10% urea is excreted by D. rerio embryos (groups of 30 embryos; N=5 groups).;  Calculated as a percentage of total nitrogenous waste produced {[Urea-N/ (Urea-N+Ammonia-N)]×100}. (C) Adult A. alcalica (N=4) and A. grahami (N=4) housed under the same conditions were assayed for the excretion of NH4 and urea and shown as a percentage of nitrogenous waste produced.; Our finding that A. alcalica are not fully ureotelic as has been previously reported for A. grahami (Randall et al., 1989) is surprising given the very close genetic relatedness between the two species and that they both live in similar soda lakes with high pH.;  We speculated that this difference could be due to the A. alcalica being kept under more benign laboratory conditions for over two years, while the published urea excretion rates in A. grahami were derived from wild fish.;  To test this hypothesis, we assessed urea excretion in A. alcalica and A. grahami that had both been housed for multiple generations in the same system water (pH 8.1).;  We found that A. alcalica excrete 42-64% of their nitrogenous waste as urea, compared to 91-100% in A. grahami (Fig. 3C).; In situ hybridisation using DIG labelled cRNA probes for Rh protein genes was used to analyse gene expression in A. alcalica embryos at 5 dpf (Fig. 5).;  A. alcalica embryos show a restricted expression domain where Rhbg (Fig. 5A,B), rhcg1 (Fig. 5D,E), and rhcg2 (Fig. 5G,H) are detected only in gill tissue (arrows).;  S1) and conclude that the expression patterns of A. alcalica rhesus protein genes are well conserved with that of D. rerio embryos and gill tissue (see Table S2).; In situ hybridisation of Rhesus glycoproteins (Rh) in A. alcalica embryos at 5 dpf and adult gills.

(H) Rhcg2 expression, ventral view of the head. (I) Rhcg2 expression in adult gills.; Gills were dissected from A. grahami and A. alcalica adults that had been housed in the same environmental conditions for several generations.;  The expression of these genes in A. alcalica was detected within 90 min after adding the substrate (BM Purple, Roche), while none were seen in A. grahami (Fig.;  Fig. 6A-C shows robust expression of Rhbg (Fig. 6A), Rhcg1 (Fig. 6B), and Rhcg2 (Fig. 6C) in gills of A. alcalica detected after 16 h in substrate.;  Fig. 6D-F shows the corresponding low-level expression of Rhbg (Fig. 6D), Rhcg1 (Fig. 6E), and Rhcg2 (Fig. 6F) in gills of A. grahami analysed in parallel, alongside A. alcalica and photographed after the same period of time.;  Fig. 6G shows the relative amount of expression of these genes in A. grahami as compared to A. alcalica.; Rh glycoprotein gene expression is dramatically downregulated in A. grahami compared to A. alcalica. (A-F) Expression analysis using in situ hybridisation of Rhesus glycoproteins (Rh) genes in adult gills dissected from A. alcalica (top row, A-C) and A. grahami (Bottom row, D-E) is shown: rhbg (A and D), rhcg1 (B and E) and rhcg2 (C and F). (G) Rhesus protein gene expression analysed using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. cDNA prepared from RNA extracted from the gills of adult A. alcalica and A. grahami was amplified using the same primer sets designed to rhbg, rhcg1, rhcg2 and eF1a.;  The average intensity of PCR products amplified from A. grahami gills is shown relative to the average intensity detected in A. alcalica gills for rhbg, rhcg1 and rhcg2.; This work demonstrates that the extremophile fish A. alcalica can excrete a proportion of its nitrogenous waste as ammonia, while A. grahami does not.;  This observation is consistent with the robust expression of functional ammonium transporters, including Rhbg, in A. alcalica.;  We show that A. alcalica Rhbg (as well as Rhcg1 and Rhcg2) are expressed in the gill in both A. alcalica embryos and adults and that Alcolapia Rhbg protein is capable of moving ammonium in two heterologous expression systems, zebrafish embryos and a yeast growth assay.;  The much higher gene expression of rhbg, rhcg1 and rhcg2 in A. alcalica may also be reflected at the level of protein expression, but this analysis has yet to be undertaken.;  While the protein coding regions of the Rhesus protein genes are almost identical between A. alcalica and A. grahami, their differential expression suggests divergence in a regulatory region that controls levels of transcription in the gills.;  It is intriguing to speculate that there is a strong transcriptional silencer acting to repress these genes in A. grahami that is not present in the very closely related A. alcalica; more molecular genetic studies should be undertaken to inform further on this.; The evolution of obligatory ureotelism in A. grahami but not in A. alcalica may be an adaptive response to the more extreme conditions of Lake Magadi.;  Lake Natron (where A. alcalica live) is much larger than Lake Magadi (∼5× surface area) and has two inflowing rivers and several perennial streams that provide an influx of freshwater (Tebbs et al., 2013).; Our in situ hybridisation experiments demonstrate that the expression of Rh genes in A. alcalica is largely restricted to adult and embryonic gills, with expression patterns similar to that in D. rerio (Nakada et al., 2007a; Zimmer and Perry, 2020) and other species such as rainbow trout (Tsui et al., 2009), mangrove killifish (Hung et al., 2007) and common carp (Sinha et al., 2016).; Like other members of the Rh family, and unlike the Amt family, no defined NH4+ binding site is present in A. alcalica Rhbg.;  The model of A. alcalica Rhbg presented in this report strongly supports a protein that functions as a typical Rh protein.; Given the near identical sequence of Rhbg in A. alcalica and A. grahami (99.5%; see Fig.;  Whether this precise mechanism also occurs in the Rh family is unknown, but a multiple sequence alignment of A. alcalica rhesus proteins and D. rerio Rhbg with E. coli AmtB shows conservation of key ammonium transport residues.; The evidence presented here indicates that Alcolapia Rhbg protein is capable of transporting ammonia; this is consistent with our finding that A. alcalica excrete a proportion of their nitrogenous waste as ammonia.; In York, a stand-alone, recirculating aquarium (Aquatic Habitats) was adapted to house A. alcalica in 10 or 30 L tanks at a constant temperature of 30°C, pH between 9.0 and 9.5 (buffered with a 40X stock of 2 M sodium bicarbonate and 2 M sodium carbonate) and salt concentration of 3800 µS (using Instant Ocean and magnesium sulphate).;  In Hull, A. grahami and A. alcalica bred for 3-4 generations in aquaria were kept in 120 L species stock tanks on the same recirculatory system, maintained at 26-29°C, pH 8.1.; To generate plasmids for probes to use for in situ hybridisation analysis, and for synthesising full-length mRNAs, we used reverse transcriptase PCR to clone A. alcalica rhesus protein genes.;  RNA was extracted from 5-day-old A. alcalica embryos using TriReagent (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's guidelines.;  A. alcalica cDNA was amplified using gene specific primers (Table S2) and cloned into pGEM T-Easy (Promega) for in situ probes using run-off transcription was used to incorporate a DIG labelled UTP analogue into an antisense cRNA probe.; Since A. alcalica Rhbg appears to have evolved under positive selection, we used AlphaFold to predict the extent to which whether the amino acid changes may have altered its structure and its ability to transport ammonia.;  The AlphaFold model of A. alcalica Rhbg was calculated using the protein sequence of Rhbg from A. alcalica (accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MW448158"",""term_id"":""1997175937"",""term_text"":""MW448158""}}MW448158) on the AlphaFold Google Colab platform (Jumper et al., 2021).;  A. alcalica embryos were collected at 5 days post fertilisation (between 15 and 20 embryos) and gills were dissected from adult A. alcalica and A. grahami.;  Total RNA extracted from adult gills of A. alcalica and A. grahami using TriReagent (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's guidelines followed by purification on an RNA clean and concentrator column (Zymo Research). cDNA was synthesised from 1 µg of total RNA using random hexamers (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and superscript IV (Invitrogen).;  Gene specific primers (Table S2) were designed to amplify Alcolapia Rhbg, Rhcg1, Rhcg2, and eF1ɑ. The nucleotides sequences in these regions are identical in A. alcalica and A. grahami so the same primers and PCR conditions were used (22 cycles).;  To test the activity of Alcolapia Rhbg in moving ammonia we included uninjected embryos and embryos where Rhbg had been overexpressed by injection of synthetic mRNA from either Danio or A. alcalica.; In order to test the ability of the A. alcalica rhesus protein genes to move ammonium in yeast, the Rhbg genes from A. alcalica and D. rerio were cloned into the vector pDR195 by homologous recombination and transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae 31019b (MATα ura3 mep1Δ mep2Δ::Leu2 mep3Δ::KanMX2), a yeast mutant with deletions in the three endogenous ammonium-transporter genes and defective in ammonium transport.; The concentrations of ammonia and urea excreted into surrounding water was measured for adult and embryonic A. alcalica and D. rerio and adult A. grahami.;  For adults: single adult A. grahami, A. alcalica and D. rerio were incubated in 600 ml of water from their respective tanks for 3 h, after which each fish was individually weighed before being returned to their home systems.;  For embryos, 5-day-old embryos were grouped (five embryos for A. alcalica and 30 embryos for D. rerio) in 30 mm petri dishes in 2 ml of tank water for 6 h on a rocker at 28°C, after which water was collected and stored at −20°C until processing."
A. grahami,87886,36250323,9672858," In contrast, the expression of these genes in A. grahami gills is much lower than in A. alcalica, suggesting the rapid evolution of a molecular mechanism underlying the complete ureotelism of A. grahami.; The cichlids of the subgenus Alcolapia, nested within the genus Oreochromis (Ford et al., 2019), are a unique radiation of extremophile fishes found in the East African soda lakes Magadi (A. grahami) and Natron (A. alcalica, A. ndalalani and A. latilabris) (Ford, 2015; Seegers et al., 1999).; The presence of Rhbg and Rhcg2 transcripts in Alcolapia gill tissue is surprising since these fish are thought to excrete all nitrogenous waste as urea, as has been reported for A. grahami (Randall et al., 1989; Wood et al., 2013).; A. grahami is reported to be fully ureotelic when assayed in its harsh native environment (Randall et al., 1989).;  We tested the hypothesis that this feature may be lost after several generations of lab breeding under temperate conditions and found that while lab bred A. alcalica living in the same aquarium excretes some of its waste as ammonia, A. grahami continues to be fully ureotelic.;  We suggest that this differential expression of Rh protein genes provides a molecular mechanism whereby A. grahami does not excrete ammonia and A. alcalica does.; Nitrogenous waste excreted by ammonotelic D. rerio and ureotelic A. alcalica and A. grahami. (A) Adult D. rerio (N=14) and A. alcalica (N=6) produce significantly different amounts of urea over a 3 h period, where in A. alcalica urea represents over 60% of their nitrogenous waste and in zebrafish this is about 10% (P-value<0.0001 as determined by Student's T test). (B) Embryos at 5 dpf show a similar profile of waste produce over a 6 h period, where A. alcalica embryos (groups of six embryos; N=7 groups) produce significantly more urea than ammonia as waste (∼80%), while only about 10% urea is excreted by D. rerio embryos (groups of 30 embryos; N=5 groups).;  Calculated as a percentage of total nitrogenous waste produced {[Urea-N/ (Urea-N+Ammonia-N)]×100}.

(A-F) Expression analysis using in situ hybridisation of Rhesus glycoproteins (Rh) genes in adult gills dissected from A. alcalica (top row, A-C) and A. grahami (Bottom row, D-E) is shown: rhbg (A and D), rhcg1 (B and E) and rhcg2 (C and F). (G) Rhesus protein gene expression analysed using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. cDNA prepared from RNA extracted from the gills of adult A. alcalica and A. grahami was amplified using the same primer sets designed to rhbg, rhcg1, rhcg2 and eF1a.;  The average intensity of PCR products amplified from A. grahami gills is shown relative to the average intensity detected in A. alcalica gills for rhbg, rhcg1 and rhcg2.; This work demonstrates that the extremophile fish A. alcalica can excrete a proportion of its nitrogenous waste as ammonia, while A. grahami does not.;  The Rhbg protein sequence is almost identical in these two species, suggesting that at the biochemical level A. grahami has the means/tools to move ammonia, but does not, even under temperate environmental conditions.; While we show that A. grahami expresses transcripts of Rhesus protein genes in the gill, and the expression of rhbg and rhcg2 proteins have previously been detected in A. grahami gill tissue (Wood et al., 2013), our comparison of gene expression levels reveals a large difference in expression levels in the two species.;  While the protein coding regions of the Rhesus protein genes are almost identical between A. alcalica and A. grahami, their differential expression suggests divergence in a regulatory region that controls levels of transcription in the gills.;  The data we present here suggest that the comparatively low level of Rhesus protein gene expression in A. grahami explains their ureotelism.;  Even after generations in non-extreme conditions, there is no recovery of Rhbg/cg expression in A. grahami and they remain fully ureotelic.;  It is intriguing to speculate that there is a strong transcriptional silencer acting to repress these genes in A. grahami that is not present in the very closely related A. alcalica; more molecular genetic studies should be undertaken to inform further on this.; The evolution of obligatory ureotelism in A. grahami but not in A. alcalica may be an adaptive response to the more extreme conditions of Lake Magadi.;  In contrast, Lake Magadi (where A. grahami are found) lacks any inflowing streams.;  This difference in native environment could provide an evolutionary explanation for the entrenched transcriptional downregulation of the rhesus protein genes in A. grahami.; Given the near identical sequence of Rhbg in A. alcalica and A. grahami (99.5%; see Fig.;  S4) it can be expected that A. grahami Rhbg also forms a functional ammonia transporter, aligning with previous work showing that Rh proteins facilitate ammonia excretion under high environmental ammonia (HEA) exposure based on the response of A. grahami Rhbg at both the mRNA and protein level in the gills under HEA stress (Wood et al., 2013).;  However, while A. grahami retain and express the genes coding for the rhesus protein genes, they do not excrete ammonia, even after generations in temperate aquarium conditions; this is likely underpinned by an A. grahami species-specific mechanism maintaining very low expression of the Rh protein genes.;  In Hull, A. grahami and A. alcalica bred for 3-4 generations in aquaria were kept in 120 L species stock tanks on the same recirculatory system, maintained at 26-29°C, pH 8.1.;  A. alcalica embryos were collected at 5 days post fertilisation (between 15 and 20 embryos) and gills were dissected from adult A. alcalica and A. grahami.;  Total RNA extracted from adult gills of A. alcalica and A. grahami using TriReagent (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's guidelines followed by purification on an RNA clean and concentrator column (Zymo Research). cDNA was synthesised from 1 µg of total RNA using random hexamers (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and superscript IV (Invitrogen).;  Gene specific primers (Table S2) were designed to amplify Alcolapia Rhbg, Rhcg1, Rhcg2, and eF1ɑ.

Natrialba magadii,13769,22559199,3403918,"Natrialba magadii is an aerobic chemoorganotrophic member of the Euryarchaeota and is a dual extremophile requiring alkaline conditions and hypersalinity for optimal growth.; The genus Natrialba within Halobacteria is a heterogeneous group of halophiles including those that thrive in neutral as well as alkaline environments [9]. The type species Natrialba asiatica, which was isolated from a beach in Japan, is non-alkaliphilic and requires a pH of 6.6 to 7.0 for optimum growth [10]. Natrialba magadii (formerly Natronobacterium magadii, a strictly aerobic chemoorganotroph isolated from Lake Magadi in Kenya) is an obligately haloalkaliphilic archaeon that requires 20% (3.5 M) NaCl, pH 9.5, and 37 to 40°C for optimum growth [9,11]. In contrast to the white-yellow color of Nab. asiaticaNab. magadii is red-orange colored due to the presence of carotenoid pigments in the cell membrane [12]. Furthermore, Nab. magadii lacks glycolipids, whereas Nab. asiatica contains bis-sulfated glycolipid S2-DGD {2, 3-diphytanyl- or phytanyl-sesterterpenyl-1-[2, 6-(HSO3)2-α-Manp-1 → 2-Glcp]-sn-glycerol} [9,13]. Previous work has demonstrated that Nab. magadii synthesizes and accumulates 2-sulfotrahalose as an osmolyte under hypersaline conditions [14]. The biochemical features of the flagellar apparatus, a nucleoside diphosphate kinase, a leucine dehydrogenase, and an extracellular serine protease of Nab. magadi have also been characterized since its discovery [15-18].; Characteristics of the replicons ofNatrialba magadiiATCC 43099;  Alignment of the large chromosomes ofNatrialba magadiiATCC 43099 andHaloterrigena turkmenicaDSM 5511 using MAUVE 2.;  B.

Arabidopsis,3702,24214268,3894706," Ectopic overexpression of TsTIP1;2 in Arabidopsis significantly increased plant tolerance to drought, salt and oxidative stresses.;  For example, tobacco NtAQP1 can conduct water and CO2 (Uehlein et al. 2003), rice OsNIP2;1 can conduct selenite and silicon (Zhao et al. 2010), tobacco NtTIPa can conduct water, glycerol and urea (Gerbeau et al. 1999), and rice OsLsi1 and Arabidopsis AtNIP5;1 can conduct silicon, boron and arsenic (Mitani-Ueno et al. 2011).;  In the present study, we identified and functionally characterized a tonoplast aquaporin gene (TsTIP1;2) from Thellungiella salsuginea (salt cress), which is a close relative of Arabidopsis thaliana and is considered a model halophyte plant (Inan et al. 2004, Volkov and Amtmann 2006, Taji et al. 2008, Amtmann 2009, Wu et al. 2012).;  We show that the expression of TsTIP1;2 increased in response to various stresses in T. salsuginea, and ectopic overexpression of TsTIP1;2 enhanced tolerance to drought, salt and oxidative stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis.;  Phylogenetic analysis of TIPs from T. salsuginea and A. thaliana was conducted and the T. salsuginea TIPs were named based on their phylogenetic relationships with Arabidopsis TIPs.;  As Arabidopsis has been used frequently in functional characterization of genes from extremophytes, we employed this model glycophyte plant as our experimental system.;  To see which is the case for TsTIP1;2, three independent transgenic Arabidopsis lines with high transgene expression (Fig. 3A) were tested for their tolerance to salt and drought stress.; Effects of drought stress on wild-type (WT) and TsTIP1;2 transgenic Arabidopsis plants.

Arabidopsis,3702,34256694,8278772," Furthermore, one of PIP1 gene, CrPIP1;5, was identified as functional using a yeast expression system and transgenic overexpression in Arabidopsis.; Unlike the AQP members in yeast (only two genes, AQY1 and AQY2) [23] or animals (only 13 AQPs in mammals) [24], plants AQPs comprised large, highly diverse gene families that may be linked to plants’ greater adaptability to local conditions given their sessile nature [11, 25]. Many AQP gene families have been identified using cDNA and whole-genome analyses in a wide variety of plant species, including Arabidopsis (35 members) [26], maize (31 members) [27], and rice (34 members) [28]. Given advances in whole genome sequencing, AQP-related research has recently gained traction in studies of plant adaptation, especially for halophyte and drought-tolerant plants.;  As a close relative of Arabidopsis, Eutrema salsugineum has been considered a model extremophile used to identify mechanisms of salt tolerance.;  Based on multiple alignments, a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed with the amino acid sequences of AQPs from C. rosea, Arabidopsis, and soybean (Fig. 1).;  We also compared the number of AQP genes in C. rosea with other plant genomes (Table ​(Table2),2), including four Leguminosae species (bean [Phaseolus vulgaris, 41 genes], chickpea [Cicer arietinum, 40], wild peanut A [Arachis duranensis, 32], and wild peanut B [Arachis ipaensis, 36]), two Brassicaceae species (Arabidopsis [Arabidopsis thaliana, 35] and salt cress [Eutrema salsugineum, 35]), and three Gramineae species (rice [Oryza sativa, 33], maize [Zea mays, 31], and foxtail millet [Setaria italica, 39]).; Phylogenetic relationships of the 37 CrAQPs from C. rosea, the 75 GmAQPs from soybean, and the 35 AtAQPs from Arabidopsis.; To further assess the effects of CrPIP1;5, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants that ectopically expressed CrPIP1;5 under the control of 35S promoters.; We found that GFP-fused CrPIP1;5 was constitutively expressed (under the control of CaMV 35S) in transgenic Arabidopsis plants.;  Root tip fluorescence of roughly three- to four-day-old transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings was easily discerned by confocal microscopy; the GFP-CrPIP1;5 protein was visible in the plasma membranes of transgenic plants, while in control plant roots, the GFP signal was distributed evenly in the whole cytoplasm (Figure S6).;  This is largely because AQP genes are seen as candidates for use in genetic modification of crops to increase agricultural productivity [39, 40]. The saltbush Atriplex canescens is highly tolerant of saline-alkaline soils, drought, heavy metals, and cold, and the AQP genes AcPIP2 and AcNIP5;1 have been shown to be involved in abiotic stress tolerance in this species, and their overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis caused altered tolerance to drought and salt [41, 42]. Compared with cultivated soybean, the wild Glycine soja is relatively salt-alkaline tolerant.;  Two AQP genes from G. soja, GsTIP2;1 and GsPIP2;1, minimized tolerance to salt and dehydration stress when overexpressed in Arabidopsis, implying they have negative impacts on stress tolerance by regulating water potential [43, 44]. In most functional analyses conducted in transgenic plants, the overexpression of AQP genes caused elevated tolerance to salt and drought, such as in Malus zumi (gene MzPIP2;1) [45], Sesuvium portulacastrum (SpAQP1) [46], Stipa purpurea (SpPIP1) [47], Simmondsia chinensis (ScPIP1) [48], Thellungiella salsuginea (TsPIP1;1) [49], and Phoenix dactylifera (PdPIP1;2) [50]. The elevated expression of AQP genes in plants can lead to cellular changes in water potential, which cause alterations in water uptake and transpiration, and ultimately modify tolerance to water deficit stress.;  We assessed the overexpression of CrPIP1;5 in transgenic Arabidopsis, and CrPIP1;5 lead to slightly reduced saline-alkaline and drought tolerance, which showed the exact opposite phenotype compared with CrPIP2;3’s overexpression in Arabidopsis [36]. This also suggests that CrPIP1;5 could play a key role in water transport.;  Here we speculated that as a foreign AQP gene, CrPIP1;5 might be involved in modifying the function of endogenous PIPs of Arabidopsis, or function more in water flowing out than water absorption in transgenic Arabidopsis roots, thereby resulted in sensitivity to salt and drought stresses.;  The overexpression of CrPIP1;5 in transgenic Arabidopsis is in contrast to most previous findings [40, 54], suggesting that overexpression of plant PIPs results in specificities of abiotic stress tolerance or sensitivity, which also might be attributed to the protein interaction, post-translational modifications (PTM), protein trafficking of the foreign AQP.;  For example, tobacco PIP1 member, NtAQP1, caused a decline of root hydraulic conductivity and decreased resistance of plants to water stress [57]. Transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants overexpressing AtPIP1;4 and AtPIP2;5 displayed rapid water loss under dehydration stress and showed enhanced water flow under drought stress [58]. The Glycine soja gene GsPIP2;1 negatively impact salt and drought stress tolerance by regulating water potential when overexpressed in transgenic Arabidopsis [44]. In addition, Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AcPIP2 (a PIP gene from saltbush A. canescens) exhibited drought-sensitive phenotypes [41]. This can be explained by the nature and intensity of stresses, combining with the cooperation between the over-expressed foreign AQPs and the endogenous AQPs.;  In our study, the over-expression of CrPIP1;5 showed some sensitivity both in yeast and in Arabidopsis, which only reflect CrPIP1;5 did involve in water stress responses in vivo.;  That, combined with our previous related research about CrPIP2;3 [36], suggested that overexpression of these two PIP genes in transgenic Arabidopsis promoted plant responses to abiotic stressors by maintaining water homeostasis, as well as decreasing the damage caused by water-deficit stress.; A bootstrap neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed based on multiple alignments of the identified AQPs from C. rosea with AQPs from Arabidopsis and soybean using MEGA 6.0 with 1,000 bootstraps.;  The sequences of GmAQPs (from soybean; Glycine max) and AtAQPs (from Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana) were downloaded from the phytozome database (https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/).;  Thus, transgenic Arabidopsis plants (col-0 genotype, three overexpression lines, OX 1#, OX 5#, and OX 10#) were generated.; In brief, seed germination rate of the CrPIP1;5 transgenic Arabidopsis (OX 1#, OX 5#, OX 10#, and WT) was measured under the following stress treatments: NaCl (175 mM, 200 mM, and 225 mM; salt stress); 5 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 95 mmol/L NaCl (pH 8.2), 7.5 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 92.5 mmol/L NaCl (pH 8.2), and 10 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 90 mmol/L NaCl (pH 8.2; alkaline stress); mannitol (200 mM, 300 mM, and 400 mM) stress.;  The goal of these treatments was to detect the effect of the overexpression of CrPIP1;5 on affecting the salt/alkaline/osmotic tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis seeds during germination.;  Additionally, root length was calculated to evaluate the influence of the overexpression of CrPIP1;5 on transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings under abiotic stress (100 mM, 150 mM, and 200 mM NaCl for salt stress; 0.5 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 99.5 mmol/L NaCl, 0.75 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 99.25 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L NaHCO3 plus 99 mmol/L NaCl, pH 8.2 for alkaline stress; 200 mM, 300 mM, and 400 mM mannitol for osmotic stress.;  Wild-type Arabidopsis and Murashige&Skoog medium (MS) or MS plus 100 mM NaCl (pH 8.2) medium were used as controls.;  The seed germination and seedling growth experiments were both performed on MS plates with or without stress factors, in the same greenhouse environment used to grow the Arabidopsis plants.;  Drought and salt/alkaline tolerance assays were also performed on transgenic adult Arabidopsis plants.;  For drought tolerance assay, thirty to forty plants of each OX lines and WT control were cultured in growth chamber as described above without watering for another 20 days, since the original vermiculite humidity could ensure regular growth of Arabidopsis plants.;  For salt tolerance assay, the ten-day-old seedlings of WT and transgenic Arabidopsis (OX 1#, OX 5#, and OX 10#) growing in square pots were irrigated with 200 mM NaCl solution (50 mL each pot) and the phenotype was recorded after 7 days.; Subcellular localization of CrPIP1;5 in Arabidopsis was also detected using GFP fusion protein in seedling roots."
C. rosea,3825,34256694,8278772," In C. rosea, AQP diversity, protein features, and their biological functions are still largely unknown.; We describe the action of AQPs in C. rosea using evolutionary analyses coupled with promoter and expression analyses.;  A total of 37 AQPs were identified in the C. rosea genome and classified into five subgroups: 11 plasma membrane intrinsic proteins, 10 tonoplast intrinsic proteins, 11 Nod26-like intrinsic proteins, 4 small and basic intrinsic proteins, and 1 X-intrinsic protein.;  Analysis of RNA-Seq data and targeted qPCR revealed organ-specific expression of aquaporin genes and the involvement of some AQP members in adaptation of C. rosea to extreme coral reef environments.;  We also analyzed C. rosea sequences for phylogeny reconstruction, protein modeling, cellular localizations, and promoter analysis.; Our results indicate that AQPs play an important role in C. rosea responses to saline-alkaline soils and drought stress.;  These findings not only increase our understanding of the role AQPs play in mediating C. rosea adaptation to extreme environments, but also improve our knowledge of plant aquaporin evolution more generally.; Canavalia rosea (Sw.) DC. (also called bay bean) is an extremophile halophyte and nitrogen-fixing legume species that is widely distributed in coastal areas of tropical and subtropical regions and is highly adapted to seawater and drought conditions [1]. The seeds of C. rosea have nutritional and medicinal value and this species constitutes an important wild plant resource.;  Notably, C. rosea presents better growth potential than most of native species, thereby plays basic and pioneering roles in island greening, sand fixation, and ecological restoration of tropical and subtropical coral islands and coastal zones [2]. Sandy soils, salinization, and seasonal drought are factors that limit growth for many plants in coastal areas or coral reefs.;  Understanding the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms of C. rosea’s adaptation to the special habitats would help to illuminate extremophile adaptations to adverse conditions.;  Saline-alkaline soils and drought stress both cause plant cellular water deficits [3] and result in water imbalances, from root water uptake to leaf transpiration [4]. Identification of genes involved in responding to water-deficit stress in C. rosea may be valuable for molecular breeding improvement of saline-alkaline and drought-related traits through genetic engineering.;  It is therefore of particular interest to identify the complete set of AQPs within C. rosea (CrAQPs) and to perform comparative analyses to understand their evolutionary relationships, particularly regarding the adaptability of this species to coastal and coral reef habitats.; In our study, the availability of whole genome sequence data for C. rosea facilitated genome-wide analysis to identify the evolutionary relationships between C. rosea AQPs and those of related leguminous species.; Base on the protein BLAST research and Hidden Markov model profile (Pfam ID: PF00230) search, a total of 37 CrAQP members were identified and annotated in the C. rosea genome database.;  Based on multiple alignments, a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed with the amino acid sequences of AQPs from C. rosea, Arabidopsis, and soybean (Fig. 1).;  The clustering results clearly showed that there was only one sequence encoding for the XIP protein in C. rosea.;  In addition, the SIP subfamily in C. rosea (CrSIP) had a smaller but more conserved cluster than other three subfamilies in C. rosea (CrNIP, CrPIP, and CrTIP).;  We also compared the number of AQP genes in C. rosea with other plant genomes (Table ​(Table2),2), including four Leguminosae species (bean [Phaseolus vulgaris, 41 genes], chickpea [Cicer arietinum, 40], wild peanut A [Arachis duranensis, 32], and wild peanut B [Arachis ipaensis, 36]), two Brassicaceae species (Arabidopsis [Arabidopsis thaliana, 35] and salt cress [Eutrema salsugineum, 35]), and three Gramineae species (rice [Oryza sativa, 33], maize [Zea mays, 31], and foxtail millet [Setaria italica, 39]).; Nomenclature and subcellular localization of AQPs identified from C. rosea genome; Phylogenetic relationships of the 37 CrAQPs from C. rosea, the 75 GmAQPs from soybean, and the 35 AtAQPs from Arabidopsis.; Conserved amino acid residues (Asn-Pro-Ala, NPA) motifs, aromatic/arginine (ar/R) filters and Froger’s positions (FPs) and trans-membrane (TM) domains of AQPs in C. rosea;  There are eleven chromosomes in the C. rosea genome and CrAQP genes were found on all except chromosome 5.; a Locations of the 37 CrAQPs on 11 chromosomes of C. rosea. b The distribution of segmental duplication of CrAQPs in C. rosea chromosomes;  The distribution of segmental duplication of CrAQPs in C. rosea chromosomes was simply showed in Fig. 2b.The selection pressure acting on CrAQP genes was inferred from the ratio of non-synonymous (Ka) to synonymous (Ks) substitution values.; Phylogenetic relationships, genes’ structure, and motif compositions of the AQP genes in C. rosea. a The phylogenetic tree on the left side is constructed using MEGA 6.0.; To further investigate the function of AQPs in C. rosea, MEME was used to identify the conserved domains of CrAQP proteins.;  We also focused on the comparison of CrAQPs’ expression levels in adult C. rosea leaves collected from various habitats (YX Island and SCBG), and the results indicated that the most of CrAQPs expressed higher in the YX sample than in the SCBG sample, particularly the CrPIP members (Fig. 5b).;  These results suggest that CrAQPs might play diverse roles in the growth and development of C. rosea, and in this extremophile halophyte’s adaptation to coral reef habitats.; Heatmaps showing (A) the expression levels of the 37 CrAQPs in the root, vine, leaf, flower bud, and young fruit of C. rosea plant and (B) expression differences of the 37 CrAQPs in mature C. rosea leaves planting in South China Botanical Garden (SCBG) and in Yongxing Island (YX); We performed a gene expression analysis on different C. rosea tissues to examine the expression patterns of CrPIP genes under various abiotic stress conditions and an ABA hormone treatment.;  Combining these results with the RNA-Seq data (Fig. 5), it is evident that these genes maintained higher expression levels than the other CrAQP genes across different tissues and habitats, suggesting that they may be involved in maintaining basic and primary water homeostasis during C. rosea growth and development.;  These results indicate the role these genes play in multiple abiotic stress responses and ABA signaling response in C. rosea.; Quantitative RT-PCR detection of the expression levels of the 11 CrPIPs responding to different stresses (600 mM NaCl, 150 mM NaHCO3, 300 mM mannitol, and 100 mM ABA) in C. rosea seedling plants. a 5 CrPIP1s. b 6 CrPIP2s.; A previous study indicated that plant PIP1 and PIP2 members can associate together in heterodimers and tetramers [35]. In our previous study, we have functional identified a C. rosea PIP2 gene, CrPIP2;3, being involved in drought tolerance in transgenic plant [36]. CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3 were both initially isolated from C. rosea cDNA library, and these two members showed much higher expression level in different tissues of C. rosea than other CrAQPs (Fig. 5a), which might indicate their relative importance of maintaining water balance in vivo.;  Aquaporins have been reported to play crucial roles in plant water balance and homeostasis under adverse growing conditions [5, 21] and in response to specific biotic challenges [37, 38]. In this study, we performed genome-wide identification and characterization of AQPs in C. rosea to understand the evolution of this family and its molecular roles.; The AQP protein family within the C. rosea genome was characterized and 37 putatively functional CrAQP isoforms (based on Pfam domain sequences) were identified, belonging to the PIP (11 isoforms), TIP (10), NIP (11), SIP (4), and XIP (1) subfamilies (Table ​(Table1).1).;  We performed whole genome sequencing of C. rosea, and our result indicates that this species is diploid, with a 534.94 Mbp genome size (data not published).;  This indicates that the number of AQPs and sequence specificity may not be directly related to the adaptation of C. rosea to extreme environments.;  In this respect, understanding the distribution, expansion, regulation, phylogenetic diversity, and evolutionary selection of AQP genes in extremophile plants like C. rosea is an important step toward potentially improving the water utilization abilities and drought adaptations of other plant species, including agricultural crops.;  Similar to previous reports showing very few or no intronless AQP genes in other plant species [30, 31, 53], only one intronless AQP was identified in C. rosea.;  This promoter analysis was also partly support by the experimental expression analyses some of selected CaAQPs, while was not absolutely consistent with the expression patterns of CaAQPs [32]. Furthermore, the expression profiles of CrAQPs in different tissues revealed by RNA-Seq indicate that some of the CrPIP and CrTIP subfamilies had higher expression levels than other subfamilies (Fig. 5a), and habitat-specific RNA-Seq data acquired from leaves further indicated the most of the CrPIP members had greater expression levels in coastal C. rosea (YX) than in inland C. rosea (SCBG; Fig. 5b).;  The qRT-PCR results also showed some of PIP members showed much higher expression level in drought-tolerant genotype chickpea than in drought-tolerant genotype chickpea [32]. Our results suggest that differential expression of CrPIPs might be associated with different water use strategies in different habitats, and the higher expression level of CrAQPs in coastal C. rosea plants might be an adaptive mechanism to deal with intracellular and extracellular water-deficit signals.;  Broadly, our results suggest a role for PIPs in regulating C. rosea hydraulics and probably adaptation to the challenging environmental conditions found on tropical coral reefs and islands.;  These data are especially helpful for characterizing AQP-interacting protein complexes involved in C. rosea’s adaptations to harsh environmental conditions such as low water availability and saline-alkaline soils.;  We also found that high levels of salt, alkaline, and ABA slightly decreased the expression of CrPIP1;5 in C. rosea, this further suggests that this gene is highly important for water movement between cells and tissues, and is indeed involved in a stress response pathway that protects yeast cells or plants from water loss under high salinity conditions and promotes water release under high osmotic stress or drought (Figs. 8b and ​and9).9).;  While in C. rosea, our results about the expression pattern of CrPIP1;5 regarding to different tissues or habitats (Fig. 5), as well as the transcriptional changes responding to salinity/alkaline, high osmotic stress, and ABA treatment (Fig. 6a), indicated that CrPIP1;5 might be boiled down to a “housekeeping gene” for basic water homeostasis, to some degree.;  Even the CrPIP1;5 showed higher expression level in YX sample than in SCBG sample (leaves) (Fig. 5b), which might be probably due to the long-term adaptive mechanism that C. rosea plants on YX island have to deal with much tougher water-deficit adversities than plants in SCBG, including water absorption from the external environment and water transportation in vivo.;  The slightly decreased expression of CrPIP1;5 in C. rosea seedlings caused by stress factors or ABA (Fig. 6a), which might be an emergency protection for alleviating the damages caused by water disturbances, since we only checked the CrPIP1;5’s expression changes in 24 h challenged by different factors.;  Overall, as an active water channel protein with high expression levels in C. rosea different tissues or challenged by different factors, the CrPIP1;5, as well as the CrPIP2;3, might be basic sustainers for water homeostasis during the development of C. rosea plants.; The leguminous nitrogen-fixing plant, C. rosea, presents extreme saline-alkaline and drought resistance and is used as pioneer species on islands and reefs for artificial vegetation construction.;  In the present study, we conducted a genome-wide analysis and characterization of AQPs in C. rosea.;  Expression profiling of CrAQPs revealed higher expression of PIP-associated genes in almost every tissue of C. rosea plants, suggesting that this subfamily likely plays important roles in developmental processes and abiotic stress responses.;  We also functionally identified one of the CrPIP1 members, CrPIP1;5, given its highest expression levels in different tissues of C. rosea.;  Although our results showed that overexpression of CrPIP1;5 could increase sensitivity to saline-alkaline and drought conditions in yeast and plants, combining the high and regulatable expression of CrPIP1;5 in C. rosea, it can be inferred that CrPIP1;5 is one of basic and important functional genes for facilitating water transportation in vivo, and might be involved in the C. rosea ecological adaptation to tropical coral reef.;  The identification of CrAQPs in this study will be useful for further investigation of the roles that AQPs play in the various developmental stages and physiological processes of C. rosea, as well as elucidating the possible ecological adaptation mechanisms of C. rosea to extreme environments, and identification candidate genes for potential introduction into transgenic agricultural crops.;  The C. rosea plants growing in SCBG were introduced gradually from coastal area in Hainan Province since 2012, and grew steadily for one to seven years with regular water and fertilizer supply in Guangzhou, China.;  To analyze tissue-specific transcriptional patterns of the identified CrAQPs, roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits were gathered from C. rosea plants grown in SCBG.;  In addition, to investigate the involvement of the CrAQPs in adaptation to different habitats, adult leaves were gathered from C. rosea plants growing in both YX and SCBG.;  In brief, the C. rosea tissues were collected outdoors and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, then the samples were stored at − 80 °C for subsequent RNA-seq analysis.; To identify all putative CrAQP genes, the genome database of C. rosea (data not published) was used to obtain DNA and protein sequences (Table S1).;  In brief, DIAMOND [59] and InterProscan (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/search/sequence/) were used to identify all C. rosea proteins with conserved domains and motifs (e < 1e−5), and all proteins were annotated using InterPro and Pfam databases (http://pfam.xfam.org/).;  Next, the selected CrAQPs were named based on their sequence homology with known AQPs and C. rosea genome annotation.; A bootstrap neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed based on multiple alignments of the identified AQPs from C. rosea with AQPs from Arabidopsis and soybean using MEGA 6.0 with 1,000 bootstraps.;  Aquaporins were mapped on C. rosea chromosomes according to positional information of the CrAQP genes in the C. rosea genome database and displayed using MapInspect software (http://mapinspect.apponic.com/).; Putative CrAQP promoter sequences (2,000 bp upstream of ATG) were retrieved from the C. rosea genomes database (Table S1).; A transcriptome database of C. rosea was constructed using Illumina HiSeq X sequencing technology.;  The quality of the RNA-Seq datasets created from seven different tissues (roots, vines, young leaves, flowers, and young siliques collected from C. rosea growing in SCBG; mature leaves from C. rosea growing in SCBG and on YX Island) was examined using FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), which produced 40 Gb clean reads.;  In brief, five different tissue samples were collected from similar young C. rosea plants (two-year-old with flowers and young siliques planted in SCBG), then these samples were cleaned and frozen quickly with liquid nitrogen for organ-specific RNA-Seq analysis.;  As to the habitat-specific RNA-Seq analysis, the mature leaves gathered separately from C. rosea plants growing in SCBG (seven-year-old plants) or native plants in YX Island, then the mature leaf samples were frozen with liquid nitrogen for future use.;  Clean reads were mapped to the C. rosea reference genome using Tophat v.2.0.10 (http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/).; To investigate the involvement of the CrAQP genes in abscisic acid (ABA) and in various stress responses, C. rosea was germinated from seed and 30-day-old seedlings were exposed to stressors.;  In brief, total RNA was extracted from C. rosea seedling tissues under the stress/ABA treatments and reverse transcribed to cDNA.; The full-length cDNAs of CrPIP1;5 (GenBank accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MT787665"",""term_id"":""2063684758""}}MT787665) and CrPIP2;3 (GenBank accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MT787666"",""term_id"":""2063684760""}}MT787666) were isolated from the cDNA library of C. rosea seedlings, in which all cDNAs were inserted into a yeast expression vector (pYES-DEST52) using Gateway® techniques (Life Technologies)."

Furthermore the AQP gene family of cassava (Manihot esculenta), a drought-tolerant tuber that is an important food resource in many African countries, has been characterized in terms of its evolution, structure, and expression patterns [33]. Canavalia rosea is more tolerant to drought, high salinity, heat, and low nitrogen and phosphorous than most of leguminous plants.; Canavalia rosea is a salt- and alkaline-tolerant and drought-adapted halophyte, and abiotic stressors, such as saline-alkaline soil, seasonal drought, strong solar irradiance, and high temperatures, are the main limiting factors that induce osmotic stress and disturb water balance for this species and other tropical seaside plants.; Canavalia rosea plants growing on Yongxing Island (YX, 16˚83′93′′ N, 112˚34′00′′ E) and in the South China Botanical Garden (SCBG, 23˚18′76′′ N, 113˚37′02′′ E) were used in this study.; We sincerely thank several unknown workers who provided us Canavalia rosea plants and seeds gathered from Hainan province, China."

yeast,4932,34256694,8278772," Furthermore, one of PIP1 gene, CrPIP1;5, was identified as functional using a yeast expression system and transgenic overexpression in Arabidopsis.; Unlike the AQP members in yeast (only two genes, AQY1 and AQY2) [23] or animals (only 13 AQPs in mammals) [24], plants AQPs comprised large, highly diverse gene families that may be linked to plants’ greater adaptability to local conditions given their sessile nature [11, 25]. Many AQP gene families have been identified using cDNA and whole-genome analyses in a wide variety of plant species, including Arabidopsis (35 members) [26], maize (31 members) [27], and rice (34 members) [28]. Given advances in whole genome sequencing, AQP-related research has recently gained traction in studies of plant adaptation, especially for halophyte and drought-tolerant plants.;  To explore CrPIP1;5-CrPIP2;3 interactions, a series of DNA constructs were prepared for a yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 7a).;  BD and AD vectors were co-transformed into yeast AH109.;  Together, these results indicate that, at least in yeast cells, these two CrPIP members can interact with themselves and each other to form active pores for water and small molecule transport across membranes.; Homodimer or Heterodimer of the CrPIP1; 5 and the CrPIP2;3 detection by yeast two-hybrid assay. a Maps of different constructs. b Both the CrPIP1;5 and the CrPIP2;3 showed self-interacting. c The CrPIP1;5 and the CrPIP2;3 could interact each other; We performed functional identification of CrPIP1;5 using a yeast expression system, constructing with a CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 recombinant vector (Fig. 8a).;  However, with the addition of PEG8000 or sorbitol, W303 transformed with CrPIP1;5 showed an obvious growth lag compared to yeast containing the pYES2 control.;  When NaCl was added to the SDG medium, the W303 yeast containing CrPIP1;5 showed better growth than the control (Fig. 8b).;  We also checked H2O2 transport activity using the yeast expression system.;  CrPIP1;5 resulted in increased H2O2 sensitivity of yeast and lower growth rates, while both the BY4741 strain and the H2O2-sensitive mutant strain skn7Δ showed similar growth performance to the SDG control plate (Fig. 8c).;  These results indicate that, at least in yeast cells, CrPIP1;5 is an active H2O and H2O2 transporter.; The spot assays for stress tolerance confirmation of the CrPIP1;5 expression in yeast. a Map of the CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 construct. b High osmotic stress and salt tolerance confirmation in yeast.;  The growth state of yeast cells (WT, BY4741) transformed with CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 and empty vector pYES2 with or without PEG8000, sorbitol, or NaCl on SDG-Ura plates.;  The concentration of these stress factors for each treatment was labeled on the left. c H2O2 oxidative stress tolerance confirmation in yeast.;  The growth state of yeast cells (WT and H2O2-sensitive mutant strain skn7Δ) transformed with CrPIP1;5-pYES-DEST52 and empty vector pYES2 with or without H2O2 on SDG-Ura plates.; In our previous research, we have characterized CrPIP2;3 as a salt/drought stress related gene [36]. Here we performed protein–protein interaction studies using yeast two-hybrid assays and found that two CrPIP members, encoded by CrPIP1;5 and CrPIP2;3, that were highly expressed in all tested tissues and almost constitutively expressed under the abiotic stress challenges and ABA treatment (Figs. 5a and ​and6).6).; Our results from the yeast overexpression system indicate that CrPIP1;5 is an active transmembrane H2O and H2O2 transporter (Fig. 8).;  We also found that high levels of salt, alkaline, and ABA slightly decreased the expression of CrPIP1;5 in C. rosea, this further suggests that this gene is highly important for water movement between cells and tissues, and is indeed involved in a stress response pathway that protects yeast cells or plants from water loss under high salinity conditions and promotes water release under high osmotic stress or drought (Figs. 8b and ​and9).9).;  In our study, the over-expression of CrPIP1;5 showed some sensitivity both in yeast and in Arabidopsis, which only reflect CrPIP1;5 did involve in water stress responses in vivo.;  Although our results showed that overexpression of CrPIP1;5 could increase sensitivity to saline-alkaline and drought conditions in yeast and plants, combining the high and regulatable expression of CrPIP1;5 in C. rosea, it can be inferred that CrPIP1;5 is one of basic and important functional genes for facilitating water transportation in vivo, and might be involved in the C. rosea ecological adaptation to tropical coral reef.; The full-length cDNAs of CrPIP1;5 (GenBank accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MT787665"",""term_id"":""2063684758""}}MT787665) and CrPIP2;3 (GenBank accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MT787666"",""term_id"":""2063684760""}}MT787666) were isolated from the cDNA library of C. rosea seedlings, in which all cDNAs were inserted into a yeast expression vector (pYES-DEST52) using Gateway® techniques (Life Technologies).;  Constructed vectors including activation domain (AD) and binding domain (BD) were co-transformed into AH109-competent yeast cells in pairs, and transformants were plated on SD/-Leu-Trp and SD/-Leu-Trp-His mediums to test protein interactions.;  The yeast strain W303 was provided by Zhou et al. [62]. The WT (Y00000) and skn7Δ (Y02900) strains were obtained from Euroscarf (http://www.euroscarf.de/index.php?name=News).;  Plasmids were introduced into yeast strains using a standard polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lithium acetate-based transformation protocol.;  The yeast spot assay for NaCl, PEG, sorbitol, and H2O2 tolerance were performed as previously described [63]."

 One of the most deeply rooted member of the Bacilli class, the thermoalkaliphile Caldalkalibacillus thermarum strain TA2.A1 (Peddie et al. 1999).;  C. thermarum TA2.A1 has a large thirteen-mer c-subunit ring (Meier et al. 2007), and its ATP synthase has been extensively researched (Cook et al. 2003; McMillan et al. 2007, 2016).; Oxford Nanopore Technology’s MinION platform enables us to sequence long reads (up to 200 kb), which should resolve the problem of repetitive regions in the genome of C. thermarum TA2.A1.;  In this research paper, we sequenced C. themarum TA2.A1 using the abovementioned techniques.; Caldalkalibacillus thermarum strain TA2.A1 was cultured as described previously (McMillan et al. 2009).;  C. thermarum TA2.A1 was grown aseptically in a shaking incubator (180 rpm) at 65 °C in an alkaline basal medium containing 10 g L−1 trypticase peptone at pH65 °C 9.5 or as indicated.; Comparison and Alignment of old and new genetic data of Caldalkalibacillus thermarum strainTA2.A1. a Statistical analysis of the assembled and annotated genome sequence of C. thermarum TA2.A1 from this manuscript compared to the 2011 publication 24. b The new circular genome is used a reference to which the old data is aligned.;  The new, annotated C. thermarum TA2.A1 sequence was uploaded to the NCBI database, with accession number: PRJNA638815.; A full genome gives us the possibility of analyzing the phylogenetic relationship of C. thermarum TA2.A1 within the Firmicutes phylum (Fig.;  The phylogenetic analysis shows that based on amino acid sequences of single copy marker genes C. thermarum TA2.A1 is part of the “Caldalkalibacillales” order, almost all by itself.;  C. thermarum TA2.A1 is joined in its order by Bacillus mannanilyticus JCM 10596 T, which is an mesophilic, moderately halotolerant, alkaliphilic chemoorganotroph (Nogi et al. 2005).; Caldalkalibacillus thermarum strain TA2.A1 is in a novel order “Caldalkalibacillales” lacement of C. thermarum TA2.A1 within the class Bacilli based on phylogenetic analysis of concatenated partial amino acid sequences of 120 bacterial conservative proteins 40 by maximum likelihood inference; taxonomic designations correspond with Genome Taxonomy DataBase 40.;  In light of this limitation we decided to compare C. thermarum TA2.A1 with environmentally similar well-describe alkaliphilic Bacillus sp., the mesophilic Bacillus sp, and the thermophilic Geobacillus stearothermophilus.;  In agreement with the analysis in Fig. 2 and Figure S1, C. thermarum TA2.A1 is the most phylogenetically ancient member of the genus Bacillus examined (Fig.; Initially, we attempted to find the origin of replication of C. thermarum TA2.A1.;  The genome of C. thermarum TA2.A1 also has a region spanning from dnaA to gyrB, which could contain the origin of replication (i.e. the oriC region).;  The 4.7 kb space between gyrB and gyrA is seemingly unique to C. thermarum TA2.A1 and it contains import machinery for magnesium and molybdate, and, most crucially, the regulator cysL, which has been described to regulate the sulfite reductase operon in B. subtilis (Guillouard et al. 2002).;  Organisms included are C. thermarum TA2.A1, B. pseudofirmus OF4 (accession: {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""CP001878"",""term_id"":""315111345""}}CP001878), B. halodurans C-125 (accession: {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AB013492"",""term_id"":""5672640""}}AB013492) and B. subtilis (accession {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""X02369"",""term_id"":""40012""}}X02369).; Within the genome of C. thermarum TA2.A1, we find nine genes encoding for CRISPR-associated proteins; three copies of the Cas1 and Cas2 adaptation genes, two copies of Cas3 and a single copy of Cas9.;  The presence of two Cas3 genes suggests that C. thermarum TA2.A1 has two different type I systems and the single Cas9 gene indicates a single type II system.;  Collectively these give C. thermarum TA2.A1 a strong capacity for defense against phages (Pougach et al. 2010).;  With this in mind, the presence of three CRISPR/Cas systems in C. thermarum TA2.A1 suggests that phages existing in thermoalkaliphilic conditions must have relatively low mutation rates making them potentially useful molecular tools.;  The genome of C. thermarum TA2.A1 contains a total of six copies of smc, the gene responsible for chromosome partitioning and at least three annotated operons dealing with spore germination, encoded by gerABC and yndE.;  C. thermarum TA2.A1 has three complete copies of pdhABCD, the operon for pyruvate dehydrogenase.; A selection of transporters and membrane proteins present in C. thermarum TA2.A1 based on the annotated genome.;  Fermentable substrates enable C. thermarum TA2.A1 to adapt to a far greater variety of conditions than substrates that have to be consumed through the TCA cycle; Previous publications on C. thermarum TA2.A1 have heavily focused on particular aspects of cellular physiology in isolation, such as transporter activity (Peddie et al. 1999, 2000), cell physiology(McMillan et al. 2009), siderophore production (McMillan et al. 2010), and the F-type ATP synthase (Meier et al. 2006; McMillan et al. 2007).;  C. thermarum TA2.A1 is no exception, while being reported to grow on a wide variety of carbon sources while remaining strictly aerobic (Fig. 4), and has a particular proclivity for growth on glutamate (McMillan et al. 2009).; Caldalkalibacillus thermarum TA2.A1 has a broad variety of substrate/sugar transporters, for (in-) organic substrates and siderophores.;  While symporters are mass-transport type, TRAP transporters are regarded as scavenging, indicating that while C. thermarum TA2.A1 is clearly capable of growth on C4-dicarboxylates (McMillan et al. 2009), it is unlikely that these are very bioavailable in an environmental setting.;  Intriguingly, C. thermarum TA2.A1 also has ccmL and ccmM (Fig. 4), genes used for inorganic carbon concentration and capture (Ludwig et al. 2000).;  Capturing inorganic carbon should be wholly useless for a heterotrophic, aerobic organism such as C. thermarum TA2.A1, these systems are usually found in photosynthetic organisms.;  C. thermarum TA2.A1 has been reported to produce a siderophore composed of catecholate and hydroxamate (McMillan et al. 2010) chemical groups, but unfortunately this molecule could not be isolated.;  Unsurprisingly, C. thermarum TA2.A1 has multiple siderophore import mechanisms to gather siderophores produced by other microbes (see Fig. 4).;  Lastly, C. thermarum TA2.A1 also has FAD/FMN export machinery (yeeO), the purpose of this is totally unknown.; Caldalkalibacillus thermarum TA2.A1 is an aerobic, chemoheteroorganotrophic organism, preferably growing on glutamate or sucrose, which are mainly converted to CO2 and acetate (McMillan et al. 2009).;  After substrate import, C. thermarum TA2.A1 has a relatively straightforward catabolism consisting of the glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (see Figs.;  For classical glycolytic sucrose consumption, the compound is imported via a phosphotransferase system, but in C. thermarum TA2.A1 symport is the dominant mechanism (Peddie et al. 2000) (see Fig. 4), and performs the split into fructose and glucose thereafter (Fig.;  Glutamate catabolism in C thermarum TA2.A1 is intriguing, as it seems to differ from known pathways (Buckel and Barker 1974; Buckel 2001).;  C. thermarum TA2.A1 lacks the genes for those pathways and instead we hypothesize it feeds glutamate directly into the TCA cycle via a one-step catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (Fig. 5), an enzyme that confusingly enough has glutamate deaminase activity (Crozier et al. 1987).; Proposed catabolic model for C. thermarum TA2.A1.;  However, nothing in the central metabolism suggests why C. thermarum TA2.A1 growth using glutamate as a carbon source has a consistently shorter lag phase and grows ~ 30% faster than when using sucrose (Fig. 6a-b), especially since both carbon sources are imported using ΔNa+-driven symport (Fig. 4).;  It is noted that this is not due to a change in cell size, since the dry weight also has a ~ 30% higher mass when C. thermarum TA2.A1 is grown on glutamate after 16 h (Fig.; C. thermarum TA2.A1 growth on glutamate vs. sucrose and influence of starting pH.; source on the growth of C. thermarum TA2.A1 in flask batch-culture using alkaline basal medium supplemented with either 10 g L−1l-glutamate or sucrose.;  C. thermarum TA2.A1 has both putative type I (ndh1) and characterized type II (ndh2) NADH dehydrogenases (Heikal et al. 2014; Godoy-Hernandez et al. 2019) (Fig. 4).;  Curiously, the iron-sulfur cluster of C. thermarum TA2.A1′s cyt.b6c1 also shows similarities to the iron-sulfur cluster in cyt.b6f of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.; At the electron-accepting end of the respiratory chain, C. thermarum TA2.A1 has extreme plasticity.;  In cytochromes aa3, ba3 and bb3C. thermarum TA2.A1 has three types of proton-translocating terminal oxidases.;  This, together with a non-proton pumping cytochrome bd leads to the notion that the variation is there for extreme optimization since C. thermarum TA2.A1 lives in an extremely proton-poor environment and that membrane potential is likely playing a greater role than pH for oxidative phosphorylation.;  Lastly, C. thermarum TA2.A1 has an extensively studied (Cook et al. 2003; Keis et al. 2004, 2006; Stocker et al. 2005; Meier et al. 2007) proton-coupled F1Fo-type ATP synthase (see Fig. 4) which is only capable of ATP synthesis, but not hydrolysis (McMillan et al. 2007, 2016).;  In the context of C. thermarum TA2.A1 the use of ferredoxin may be involved in glutamate synthesis from glutamine and α-ketoglutarate (van den Heuvel et al. 2003), giving another possible reason why the microorganism grows so well on this substrate (i.e. it does not have to synthesize glutamate because it is bioavailable).; An important feature of C. thermarum TA2.A1 is that while it is indeed an obligate alkaliphile when grown on C4-dicarboxylates, it is a facultative alkaliphile when grown on fermentable substrates such as sucrose.;  This naturally means C. thermarum TA2.A1 has to be able to adapt to neutral pH conditions in which more protons are located outside of the cell than in (Krulwich and Guffanti 1989), and an inverted ΔpH at alkaline conditions (Yumoto 2002).;  Interestingly enough, C. thermarum TA2.A1 does this without altering its maximum specific growth rate, propping up the dearth of its proton motive force—a decline of − 164 mV at pH 7.5 to − 78 mV at pH 10—with a − 100 mV sodium motive force (Olsson et al. 2003).;  If the balance of cations is wholly disrupted, H+ export is undesirable, or H+ import impossible, C. thermarum TA2.A1 has ‘emergency override systems’. ATP-dependent uniporters for Na+ (natCAB) and K+ (pstS) are present for such a situation (see Fig. 4).; Caldalkalibacillus thermarum TA2.A1 has three annotated toxin-antitoxin systems.; This article outlines the first report of a complete circular chromosome of the thermoalkaliphile Caldalkalibacillus thermarum TA2.A1.;  Finally, we describe how its many monovalent cation antiporters are capable of enabling the facultative alkaliphilic lifestyle of C. thermarum TA2.A1.;  Daran for advice in the genome assembly of Caldalkalibacillus thermarum TA2.A1."
Arthrospira,35824,28045976,5207672," Throughout the whole water column the photosynthetic biomass was dominated (>97% of total biovolume) by the filamentous cyanobacteria Arthrospira sp. with a straight morphotype.;  A single taxon, belonging to the genus Arthrospira, was found responsible for almost all photosynthetic primary production.; In freshwaters, very high microbial densities and metabolic rates are usually transient and linked to bloom events, occasionally related to nutrient inputs [12, 13], whereas saline and alkaline lakes have permanently high biomass and production rates [11, 14, 15]. Saline and alkaline lakes are, therefore, considered to be among the most productive aquatic systems on Earth [16]. For example, the saline lakes in the Rift Valley harbor high biomasses of cyanobacteria belonging to the genus Arthrospira, with a transient dominance of diatoms or chlorophytes (e.g.; Microscopic examination revealed that a filamentous cyanobacterium corresponding to the morphology of a straight Arthrospira (Fig 5A and 5B) dominated, accounting for 99.2 and 97.5% of the total biomass in 2010 and 2011, respectively (Table 2).;  Classification of this cyanobacterium into the Arthrospira genus was based on the following morphological characteristics: trichome cylindrical, not or slightly constricted at the cross-walls, gradually attenuated at the ends, apical cell rounded often with thickened outer cell wall, cells shorter than wide (8.02–9.45 μm wide, 3.4–3.65 μm long), cross-wall visible (under light microscope), motile (gliding, rotation), cell content olive-green with numerous aerotopes.;  The identification as Arthrospira using the morphological approach was confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses on the two cultivated isolates (PMC 737.11 and 738.11).;  Molecular analyses revealed that this cyanobacterium shared 99% sequence identity with Arthrospira platensis and A. maxima (Fig 6).; (A) Total phytoplankton community after Lugol staining with large Arthrospira sp. trichomes (1), thin filaments belonging to the Leptolyngbyaceae family (2), unidentified coccoidal cells (3), and large eukaryotic colored flagellate (4).

(D) Epifluorescence microscopy picture after SybrGold staining of nucleic acids, highlighting bacterioplankton morphological diversity.; Clustering of Dziani Dzaha Arthrospira sp. (in bold) with related Oscillatoriales species is provided with accession number and collection codes.; This high chlorophyll a biomass was dominated by a large, straight filamentous planktonic cyanobacterium belonging to the genus Arthrospira (up to 97.7% of the total biomass, Table 2).;  This genus is typically characterized by tightly or loosely coiled trichomes [39]. Transformations from helical to straight morphotypes have been observed in laboratory-grown cultures and production plants, however the control factors triggering such changes are still unknown [60, 61]. The genus Arthrospira is found in a wide range of saline habitats, and appears well adapted to saline-alkaline and even hypersaline environments [61]. Arthrospira is known to produce mass growth in many soda lakes in Africa as well as in alkaline lakes in Kenya [7]. This dominance affects the phytoplankton diversity, which is very low in Dziani Dzaha (up to 6 morphotypes were found during this survey).;  Indeed, Arthrospira harbors particular metabolic pathways to withstand these harsh conditions [61, 62]. Characterizing the cyanobacterial metabolites in Dziani Dzaha communities or from isolated strains is one way of gaining a better understanding of their dominance and high biomass.;  In agreement with the diversity / productivity relationship for phytoplankton communities [75], the high biomass and production in Dziani Dzaha is associated with low phytoplankton diversity and the biomass is dominated by a single taxon represented by the filamentous cyanobacterium Arthrospira.;  In most tropical saline lakes, species belonging to the genus Arthrospira often appear coiled, and are responsible for high phytoplankton biomasses that are normally transferred to upper trophic levels [76–78]. A combination of polyphasic taxonomy methods using both ultrastructural characterization and 16S rRNA gene analyses is currently in progress to describe the members of the cyanobacteria community found in this lake."

RES, a pridinyl bisphosphonate, inhibits bone resorption by changing osteoclast cytoskeleton protein [11], and induces osteoclast apoptosis [12]. RES has been previously used for the curing osteoporosis in menopausal women [13]. Topical treatments with RES (at a concentration of 0.02% and 2.5 mg/kg/day) in OVX rat and/or mice have shown sustained bone biomechanical and microstructural features [14, 15]. Hence, after OVX, oral administration of risedronate sodium (2.5 mg/kg per day) was employed as a positive-control.; In this study, we aimed to investigate the optimal compositions of EAP:TM mixtures that are associated with clear synergistic anti-osteoporotic potential compared with the single formulations, using bilateral OVX female mice, a renowned rodent model for studying human osteoporosis [7, 9].; One hundred and sixty virgin female SPF/VAF (CrljOri:CD1 [ICR]; 7-weeks old) mice, purchased from OrientBio, Seungnam, Republic of Korea, were acclimatized for 8 days and then used for these experiments.;  Four mice were assigned per polycarbonate cage and reared in a humidity (45–55%), and temperature (20–25 °C), −controlled room.;  In this experiment, 150 mice were allocated as OVX-operated osteoporosis model and 10 mice were allocated as sham-operated control.;  After 34 days of OVX operation, 8 mice from each group were chosen depending on body weight deviations (OVX-mice: 37.38 ± 2.71 g, range of 34.2 ~ 44.4 g; sham-operated mice: 33.86 ± 2.53 g, range of 30.3 ~ 37.5 g).;  The bilateral OVX surgery was not performed in the sham operated mice group (2nd group).;  At the initiation and termination of sample administration as well as on the day of OVX, all trial mice were starved for approximately 18 h (only water was supplied) to decrease alterations due to feeding.;  SPSS ver. 14 (IBM-SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the statistical analyses [52]. To estimate the effectiveness of the test material, the percent fluctuations between treated-mice and the OVX-control were estimated respectively by Eq. [5], and Eq.

All OVX-control groups revealed significant increases in body weights.;  Furthermore, significantly (p < 0.01; p < 0.05) higher body weight gains were observed in OVX-mice during the 5-weeks of OVX recovery/induction period.;  Although, obvious decreases in body weights were noticed during some periods of treatment with EAP:TM 1:1, 1:5, 3:1, and 7:1 as compared with the OVX-mice; animals treated with all EAP and TM formulations showed significant (p < 0.01) decreases in body weight gains.;  Specifically, EAP:TM (3:1) treated OVX mice revealed significant (p < 0.05) reductions in body weight gains as compared with mice treated with other formulations.;  RES (2.5 mg/kg)-treated mice showed no significant variations in body weights and body weight gains throughout the entire experimental period (Table 1;

 In particular, EAP:TM (3:1)-treated mice showed significantly (p < 0.01) increased inhibition of bone mass depletion and destruction of structures induced by OVX.;  RES treated groups also displayed increases in TV/BV, Tbn, and Tbl of the left femur, but femur Cbt and Tbt showed no significant differences compared with that of OVX mice (Tables ​(Tables44 and ​and5;5; Fig. ​Fig.5;5; Additional file 7).; OVX control mice displayed increased femur Ocn and OS/BS ratios as compared with the sham control mice.;  Although RES-treated mice exhibited comparable left femur Ocn as that of the OVX control mice, OS/BS ratios were significantly deceased as compared to that in the OVX controls (Table 5; Fig. ​Fig.5;5; Additional file 8).;  During this experiment, we used bilateral OVX mice, a renowned rodent model for studying human osteoporosis [7–9], to observe the synergistic anti-osteoporotic potential of mixtures containing different proportions of EAP and TM compared with that of the single formulation of each herbal extract.; OVX mice showed noticeable increases in body weight, weight gain, and serum osteocalcin levels, as well as decreases in serum bALP activity, femur wet, dry, and ash weights, femur Ca and IP contents, BMD, and strength as compared to sham vehical control.;  Hence, EAP:TM 3:1 demonstrated favorable anti-osteoporotic effects in OVX mice that were comparable to RES (2.5 mg/kg) treatment.; During the present study, the observed increases in weight gain and body weights in the OVX groups were distinct signs of estrogen-deficient condition in the tested mice, however the differences were inconsistent.;  Lorden and Caudle (1986) as well as Bain et al. (1993) reported increases in body weight after OVX [55, 56], while other studies failed to report the same [57, 58]. Generally, decreases in body weight or weight gain have been considered a sign of toxicity in normal states but in disease states, such as obesity, it is regarded as a favorable sign [7, 9]. During this study, noteworthy decreases in bodyweight gains were observed in all mice treated with EAP:TM formulations, particularly in EAP:TM 3:1-formulation.; Changes in bone weight are not considered a significant parameter for detecting the efficacy of an anti-osteoporotic agent [59]. However, increases in relative bone weights have been deliberated as a valued indicator of anti-osteoporotic property [7, 9]. In the present study, OVX mice showed noteworthy decreases in femur absolute and relative dry and ash weights, as well as relative wet-weights.;  Conversely, marked enhancements in femur dry, wet, and ash weights were noticed in mice treated with all test materials, including RES (2.5 mg/kg).;  However, all EAP:TM single or mixed formulations and especially, mice treated with EAP:TM 3:1-formualtion showed increases in serum bALP activity and decreases in osteocalcin levels.;  Nevertheless, marked increases in femur Ca and IP levels were noticed in all mice administered the test materials, including EAP:TM 1:1, compared with that in OVX control mice.;  In particular, EAP:TM 3:1-treated mice also revealed marked increases in Ca and IP contents in the right femur.;  Especially, EAP:TM 3:1 (g/g)-treated mice showed significant enhancement in femur mean BMD, total body and femur strength as compared to those of EAP or TM single formulations.;  In particular, EAP:TM 3:1-treated mice showed greater inhibition of the histopathological reduction in osteoclast activation and femur bone mass compared to mice administered with the TM or EAP single formulations.; Raw data on body weight gain in sham-operated and OVX mice.;  Values are expressed mean ± S.D. of eight mice. *All animals were overnight fasted.

B. clausii,79880,24915287,4051777," Whereas ABTS, promazine, and phenyl hydrazine activities vs. pH were similar, the activity of B. clausii cotA was shifted upwards by ∼0.5–2 pH units for the simple phenolic substrates DMP, SGZ, and caffeic acid.;  This shift is not due to substrate affinity (KM) but to pH dependence of catalytic turnover: The kcat of B. clausii cotA was 1 s−1 at pH 6 and 5 s−1 at pH 8 in contrast to 6 s−1 at pH 6 and 2 s−1 at pH 8 for of B. subtilis cotA.;  While both proteins were heat activated, activation increased with pH and was larger in cotA from B. clausii.;  The B. clausii cotA had ∼20 minutes half-life at 80°C, less than the ∼50 minutes at 80°C for cotA from B. subtilis.;  While cotA from B. subtilis had optimal stability at pH∼8, the cotA from B. clausii displayed higher combined salt- and alkali-resistance.; We found that the cotA from B. clausii has activity profiles shifted towards higher pH compared to B. subtilis cotA, notably for DMP, SGZ, and caffeic acid.;  This finding is in accordance with the optimal growth conditions of B. clausii.;  Both enzymes displayed substantial heat activation, as previously reported for B. subtilis spores [15], but for B. clausii cotA, the activation was much larger at higher pH.; The gene of B. clausii cotA (see sequence alignment in Figure S1 in File S1) was identified using protein BLAST with B. subtilis cotA as template against the genomic sequence of B. clausii KSM-K16.; The protein stability was investigated at 50°C and 70°C for the B. clausii and B. subtilis laccases in parallel, by incubating both enzymes at these temperatures and at pH 8, 9, or 10 for variable amounts of time. 200 µL laccase solutions in 20 mM buffer was incubated in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube on a temperature calibrated Eppendorf themomixer, and at different time points, 10 µL was retracted and immediately placed in a chilled 96-plate well with 90 µL milliQ water.; A Michaelis-Menten experiment was performed at pH 8.5 (∼pHopt for B. clausii cotA) using an apparent enzyme concentration of 1 nM.; 
B. clausii KSM-16 encodes a cotA gene, has optimal growth at pH 9 at 40°C [38], compared to optimal growth at pH 8 for B. subtilis, suggesting a slightly higher alkaline tolerance.;  The M protease from B. clausii belongs to the high-alkaline subtisilin group with maximum activity at pH 12.3.;  These two biological observations suggest higher spore stability at higher pH values and prompted our cloning, expression, and characterization of B. clausii cotA.; 
Figure 1A shows a sequence-derived nearest neighbor tree of homologous cotA enzymes created using MEGA 5.2 [43] started from the first 100 BLAST hits of B. clausii cotA against the Uniref90 database, and then reduced to only the high-scoring branches after a 1000-step bootstrap validation.;  It can be seen that the B. clausii cotA clusters together with a B. alcalophilus cotA in a different clade from that of B. subtilis cotA, showing a closer homology to this protein from an extremophilic bacteria.;  The B. clausii KSM-K16 cotA protein sequence was found to have 59% identity and 74% homology (BLOSUM62) with B. subtilis cotA, with most differences positioned within surface loops.;  The most notably difference between the two primary sequences is that B. clausii cotA lacks the cystine forming loop present in B. subtilis cotA.; (A) Nearest-neighbor tree of B. clausii cotA as described in the text.;  Bootstrap values are given at the base of each branch. (B) The substrate binding pocket of cotA highlighting the differences between B. subtilis (green) and B. clausii (purple) cotA as described in the text.;  Amino acid changes are numbered on the B. subtilis cotA sequence and annotated with the B. clausii cotA amino acid last. (C) The water exit channel of cotA with similar highlighting.; 
Figures 1B and 1C show the superpositions of a structure of B. clausii from homology modeling (purple) on the B. subtilis cotA structure 3ZDW [45], (green).;  The tertiary structure of B. clausii cotA was constructed with Phyre2 [46], giving a homology model that was overall similar in tertiary and secondary structure to structure 3ZDW of B. subtilis cotA.;  Two residues in contact with the substrate are substituted in B. clausii cotA; G417V and A227F, using the residue numbering from B. subtilis cotA.;  The pHopt∼7 is also consistent with that reported previously for B. subtilis cotA [35]. The notable difference between the two enzymes is that the laccase from B. clausii remains active at a higher pH than its ortholog from B. subtilis and keeps 50% of the activity at pH 9 at which the B. subtilis cotA displays almost no activity.; In terms of the phenolic substrate DMP (Figure 2C), we found an optimal turnover for B. subtilis cotA at pH∼7, which is in agreement with previously reported pHopt for this protein and substrate [35]. In contrast, the cotA from B. clausii was most effective above pH 8, showing a significant shift in pHopt (∼1.3) compared to the cotA from B. subtilis, further indicating enhanced alkalophilicity of the cotA from B. clausii.;  The pH activity profile (Figure 2D) shows an optimal pH shifting from 6 for B. subtilis cotA to 7 for B. clausii cotA.;  Similar to SGZ, the activity of B. clausii cotA broadens into the alkaline range with 40% activity at pH 8 compared to none for B. subtilis cotA.;  The laccase from B. clausii and B. subtilis were found to have slightly different pHopt shifting from ∼4.5 in B. subtilis cotA to ∼5 with B. clausii cotA.;  Tannic acids have been reported to inhibit tyrosinases [50]. The optimal pH activity profiles for oxidation of tannic acid (Figure 2G) are similar for both enzymes, with pH optima of ∼7.5±0.5, although the curve of B. clausii cotA shifted ∼0.5 pH units towards more alkaline conditions.;  First, promazine, ABTS, bilirubin, and to some extent phenylhydrazine and tannic acid show similar activity profiles vs. pH for the enzymes, with similar pHopt, despite some enhanced loss of B. clausii cotA activity at low pH for ABTS and phenylhydrazine.; Second and in contrast, caffeic acid, SGZ, and DMP (and to some extent the polyphenol tannic acid) all have their active pH range increased for B. clausii cotA, compared to B. subtilis cotA.;  Interestingly, the pH optima follow the pKa values with 7, 7, and 8 for B. clausii cotA and 6, 6.6, and 7 for B. subtilis cotA, with a general trend of the B. clausii laccase being more active at higher pH.; A third trend, potentially related to the second one, is a shoulder in the activity profile in the pH range 8–9 for B. clausii cotA, which makes the activity profiles skewed towards higher pH.;  As this effect was seen for all the measured substrates that have activities in this pH range and since the effect did not follow the pKa of substrates, it suggests that B. clausii cotA has adapted to a generally more alkaline environment, consistent with an optimal growth at pH 9 of its host organism [38]. This non-substrate-specific activity effect coincides with the emerging OH− inhibition at above-neutral pH.;  B. clausii cotA has a glutamic acid (V110E) on the brim of the exit channel, which in itself, via electrostatic repulsion, might reduce OH− affinity for the channel, or it can possibly make an interaction with the other variable amino acid 427Q to reduce OH− entry during catalytic turnover.; In conclusion, the activity of the newly characterized cotA from B. clausii is in some ways similar to that of the cotA from B. subtilis, but its increased pHopt and the broadened activity profiles up to 1–2 units higher pH for the phenolic substrates DMP, caffeic acid, and SGZ suggest a mechanism of alkali-tolerance that is explored further below.;  To investigate the stability of the newly characterized cotA from B. clausii we first measured the activity of protein samples that had been stored in buffers at pH 3–10 and incubated at 30°C and 50°C for five hours (See Figure S4 and Figure S5 in File S1).;  From these experiments, the stability of B. subtilis cotA appears to be maximal in the range 7.6–8.6, while the B. clausii cotA shows a monotonic increase in activity as the pH becomes more alkaline.; To investigate the temperature behavior of the newly characterized cotA from B. clausii in more detail, we studied its residual activity after incubation at various times at 50°C, 70°C, and 80°C, as described in the Methods section.;  This was especially prominent for B. clausii laccase and complicates the analysis of the thermostability.; (A) B. subtilis cotA at 50°C; (B) B. subtilis cotA at 70°C; (C) B. subtilis cotA at 80°C; (D) B. clausii cotA at 50°C; (E) B. clausii cotA at 70°C; (F) B. clausii cotA at 80°C.; Heat activation is visible at pH(circles, solid line), 9 (squares, broken line) and 10 (triangles, dotted line). (A) B. subtilis cotA at 50°C; (B) B. subtilis cotA at 70°C; (C) B. clausii cotA at 50°C; (D) B. clausii cotA at 70°C.;  A similar fit was not possible for B. clausii due to its substantial heat activation but it is clear that its stability at pH 8 and 9 is slightly higher than at pH 10.;  Still, a plateau resulting from combined activation and degradation is visible within the first 20 minutes for both laccases except at pH 10 for cotA from B. clausii, which is degraded quickly at this high temperature.;  This compares well with the 56 minutes that can be read from the data in the original B. subtilis cotA characterization from 80°C incubation at pH 7.6 [15]. We estimated the corresponding t½(80°C) of B. clausii cotA to be ∼20 minutes at pH 8 and substantially less pH-dependent than cotA from B. subtilis.; From all measurements, B. clausii cotA had similar apparent stabilities in pH 8 and pH 9 and slightly lower stability in pH 10.;  A similar reading of B. clausii cotA at pH 9 gives 18%. These data thus show that the new cotA from B. clausii is slightly less thermostable than the cotA from B. subtilis, but has traded some of this thermostability for a higher stability at pH 9–10, whereas cotA from B. subtilis is found to be clearly most stable at pH 8.; From the short-time interval measurements shown in Figure 4, we can see that at 50°C, cotA from B. subtilis (Figure 4A) displayed no thermal activation at any pH whereas the laccase from B. clausii (Figure 4C) was activated three-fold within the first 300 minutes at pH 10, and two-fold at pH 8.;  The unusual, higher activation at higher pH for B. clausii cotA was consistent across the measured rates at pH 8, 9, and 10, and thus significant.;  At 70°C, the cotA from B. clausii (Figure 4D) displayed activation up to 220% within 20–40 minutes and then started to degrade.;  This heat-favored release may further be more pronounced in proteins with specific residues in the channels that favor anion release, such as the negative charge of B. clausii cotA.; 
Figure 5 shows the activity (initial rates of SGZ product formation) of cotA from B. subtilis and B. clausii as a function of both NaCl concentration and pH.; (A) B. subtilis cotA; (B) B. clausii cotA; (C) Intersection at 400 mM NaCl and (D) intersection at 1000 mM NaCl, with B. clausii cotA in full lines and B. subtilis cotA in broken lines.;  From these figures, it is more clear that the cotA from B. subtilis loses activity quickly above pH 8, whereas the cotA from B. clausii preserves substantial activity at higher pH, consistent with the results from the activity profiles vs. pH, Figure 2.; Heat activation is common for laccases, but for B. clausii we also observed similar effect from high pH incubation and NaCl.;  The profiles were fitted with a Gaussian using a mean pH of 7.7 and an amplitude of 30.8 for B. subtilis cotA and 8.1 and 4.0 for B. clausii cotA, respectively.;  The ratios of the two parameters depend similarly on pH (Figure 6C), although the optimum for cotA from B. clausii is at ∼0.4 higher pH, as obtained from a Gaussian fitting.;  This finding confirms that the performance of cotA from B. clausii at higher pH is enhanced by activity associated with the copper sites, not the substrate binding step, and is consistent with an enhanced ability to prevent anion inhibition.;  The measured KM for B. clausii cotA was 1.02 mM, similar to cotA from B. pumilus with reported KM 0.822 mM towards DMP at pH 7 and 37°C [58].;  We accounted for this activation in the calculation of protein concentration and kcat for B. clausii using a factor of 3 as indicated by Figure 3 and used absorption at 600 nm for concentration estimation (File S1, Figure S8).;  The values of kcat deduced from the analysis (Figure 6) are for B. subtilis cotA ∼6 s−1 at pH 6 and ∼2 s−1 at pH 8 and for B. clausii cotA 1 s−1 at pH 6 and 5 s−1 at pH 8.;  Moreover, since we performed the Michaelis-Menten analysis at various pH-values, we also observed that this inhibition is absent at acidic pH but initiates at pH∼6 for B. subtilis cotA and at pH∼7 for B. clausii cotA.;  Thus, the pH-dependence of the non-competitive inhibition is also consistent with the alkaline advantage of cotA from B. clausii.; We have reported the cloning, expression and characterization of a cotA from B. clausii, strictly benchmarked against its well-known ortholog from B. subtilis, expressed heterologously and characterized fully in parallel.;  We find that cotA from B. clausii has a shift in optimal pH for oxidation of phenolic substrates and a high salt resistance at high pH, compared to its ortholog from B. subtilis.; The stabilities of the two enzymes were substantial, with half-times of inactivation of 50 and 20 minutes for cotAs from B. subtilis and B. clausii, respectively, at pH 8 and 80°C.;  This advantage is, as shown in this work, further enhanced by the interplay of salt and pH at alkaline conditions where the cotA enzymes, in particular the cotA from B. clausii, work well.; The additional proficiency of cotA from B. clausii could be due to substitutions relative to its B. subtilis ortholog that may repel anion inhibitors in the water exit channel (notably V110E, Figure 1), although this requires further investigation, as does the complex interplay between pH and salt.;

B. subtilis,1423,24915287,4051777," We report the cloning, expression, and characterization of the bacterial cotA from Bacillus clausii, a supposed alkalophilic ortholog of cotA from B. subtilis.;  This shift is not due to substrate affinity (KM) but to pH dependence of catalytic turnover: The kcat of B. clausii cotA was 1 s−1 at pH 6 and 5 s−1 at pH 8 in contrast to 6 s−1 at pH 6 and 2 s−1 at pH 8 for of B. subtilis cotA.;  Overall, kcat/KM was 10-fold higher for B. subtilis cotA at pHopt.;  The B. clausii cotA had ∼20 minutes half-life at 80°C, less than the ∼50 minutes at 80°C for cotA from B. subtilis.;  While cotA from B. subtilis had optimal stability at pH∼8, the cotA from B. clausii displayed higher combined salt- and alkali-resistance.; We found that the cotA from B. clausii has activity profiles shifted towards higher pH compared to B. subtilis cotA, notably for DMP, SGZ, and caffeic acid.;  Both enzymes displayed substantial heat activation, as previously reported for B. subtilis spores [15], but for B. clausii cotA, the activation was much larger at higher pH.; The gene of B. clausii cotA (see sequence alignment in Figure S1 in File S1) was identified using protein BLAST with B. subtilis cotA as template against the genomic sequence of B. clausii KSM-K16.; The protein stability was investigated at 50°C and 70°C for the B. clausii and B. subtilis laccases in parallel, by incubating both enzymes at these temperatures and at pH 8, 9, or 10 for variable amounts of time. 200 µL laccase solutions in 20 mM buffer was incubated in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube on a temperature calibrated Eppendorf themomixer, and at different time points, 10 µL was retracted and immediately placed in a chilled 96-plate well with 90 µL milliQ water.;  We used the extinction coefficient as previously reported for B. subtilis cotA of 4000 M−1cm−1[40], which is similar to those of other bacterial laccases (e.g. 3900 M−1cm−1[19]), making this assignment robust.;  The impressive characteristics of B. subtilis cotA are surprising in the context of the native host being a mesophile, and we thus aimed at identifying orthologs from more extremophilic hosts.; 
B. clausii KSM-16 encodes a cotA gene, has optimal growth at pH 9 at 40°C [38], compared to optimal growth at pH 8 for B. subtilis, suggesting a slightly higher alkaline tolerance.;  It can be seen that the B. clausii cotA clusters together with a B. alcalophilus cotA in a different clade from that of B. subtilis cotA, showing a closer homology to this protein from an extremophilic bacteria.;  The B. clausii KSM-K16 cotA protein sequence was found to have 59% identity and 74% homology (BLOSUM62) with B. subtilis cotA, with most differences positioned within surface loops.;  The most notably difference between the two primary sequences is that B. clausii cotA lacks the cystine forming loop present in B. subtilis cotA.;  Bootstrap values are given at the base of each branch.

Figures 1B and 1C show the superpositions of a structure of B. clausii from homology modeling (purple) on the B. subtilis cotA structure 3ZDW [45], (green).;  The tertiary structure of B. clausii cotA was constructed with Phyre2 [46], giving a homology model that was overall similar in tertiary and secondary structure to structure 3ZDW of B. subtilis cotA.;  The two loops that are connected by the cystine bridge in B. subtilis cotA are generally similar for the two proteins, apart from the tight GCGGD turn that allows the cysteines to bind.;  Two residues in contact with the substrate are substituted in B. clausii cotA; G417V and A227F, using the residue numbering from B. subtilis cotA.; We first compare our obtained activity of the cotA from B. subtilis with previous work, in particular the pH optima with ABTS, SGZ, and DMP [15], [35]. As seen in Figure 2A, the ABTS oxidation rate of cotA from B. subtilis has maximum near pH∼4.;  This value is consistent with the pHopt(ABTS) of ∼4 obtained previously for cotA from B. subtilis
[35]. Furthermore, the activity behavior vs. pH is quite similar for the new cotA across the pH range, given similar pHopt for this substrate.;  The pHopt∼7 is also consistent with that reported previously for B. subtilis cotA [35]. The notable difference between the two enzymes is that the laccase from B. clausii remains active at a higher pH than its ortholog from B. subtilis and keeps 50% of the activity at pH 9 at which the B. subtilis cotA displays almost no activity.; In terms of the phenolic substrate DMP (Figure 2C), we found an optimal turnover for B. subtilis cotA at pH∼7, which is in agreement with previously reported pHopt for this protein and substrate [35]. In contrast, the cotA from B. clausii was most effective above pH 8, showing a significant shift in pHopt (∼1.3) compared to the cotA from B. subtilis, further indicating enhanced alkalophilicity of the cotA from B. clausii.;  The pH activity profile (Figure 2D) shows an optimal pH shifting from 6 for B. subtilis cotA to 7 for B. clausii cotA.;  Similar to SGZ, the activity of B. clausii cotA broadens into the alkaline range with 40% activity at pH 8 compared to none for B. subtilis cotA.;  The laccase from B. clausii and B. subtilis were found to have slightly different pHopt shifting from ∼4.5 in B. subtilis cotA to ∼5 with B. clausii cotA.; Second and in contrast, caffeic acid, SGZ, and DMP (and to some extent the polyphenol tannic acid) all have their active pH range increased for B. clausii cotA, compared to B. subtilis cotA.;  Interestingly, the pH optima follow the pKa values with 7, 7, and 8 for B. clausii cotA and 6, 6.6, and 7 for B. subtilis cotA, with a general trend of the B. clausii laccase being more active at higher pH.; In conclusion, the activity of the newly characterized cotA from B. clausii is in some ways similar to that of the cotA from B. subtilis, but its increased pHopt and the broadened activity profiles up to 1–2 units higher pH for the phenolic substrates DMP, caffeic acid, and SGZ suggest a mechanism of alkali-tolerance that is explored further below.;  From these experiments, the stability of B. subtilis cotA appears to be maximal in the range 7.6–8.6, while the B. clausii cotA shows a monotonic increase in activity as the pH becomes more alkaline.;  Again, we performed all measurements completely in parallel also for the cotA from B. subtilis, to enable a strict benchmark for characterization.; (A) B. subtilis cotA at 50°C; (B) B. subtilis cotA at 70°C; (C) B. subtilis cotA at 80°C; (D) B. clausii cotA at 50°C; (E) B. clausii cotA at 70°C; (F) B. clausii cotA at 80°C.; Heat activation is visible at pH(circles, solid line), 9 (squares, broken line) and 10 (triangles, dotted line). (A) B. subtilis cotA at 50°C; (B) B. subtilis cotA at 70°C; (C) B. clausii cotA at 50°C; (D) B. clausii cotA at 70°C.;  An attempt to fit an exponential decay to the B. subtilis cotA data is given in Figure 3B, where only the data after 120 minutes have been used in the fitting procedure.;  B. subtilis cotA show best stability at pH 8 with an approximate t½(70°C) of 250 minutes compared to 110 minutes at pH 9 and pH 10.;  The exponential decay function for B. subtilis cotA where the first 20 minutes have been disregarded in the fitting procedure is given in Figure 3C.;  This compares well with the 56 minutes that can be read from the data in the original B. subtilis cotA characterization from 80°C incubation at pH 7.6 [15]. We estimated the corresponding t½(80°C) of B. clausii cotA to be ∼20 minutes at pH 8 and substantially less pH-dependent than cotA from B. subtilis.;  In contrast, B. subtilis cotA exhibited highest apparent stabilities at pH 8.;  At pH 8 B. subtilis cotA has 30% activity after 100 minutes of incubation at 80°C.;  A similar reading of B. clausii cotA at pH 9 gives 18%. These data thus show that the new cotA from B. clausii is slightly less thermostable than the cotA from B. subtilis, but has traded some of this thermostability for a higher stability at pH 9–10, whereas cotA from B. subtilis is found to be clearly most stable at pH 8.; From the short-time interval measurements shown in Figure 4, we can see that at 50°C, cotA from B. subtilis (Figure 4A) displayed no thermal activation at any pH whereas the laccase from B. clausii (Figure 4C) was activated three-fold within the first 300 minutes at pH 10, and two-fold at pH 8.;  At an incubation temperature of 70°C, the cotA from B. subtilis began to display some thermal activation up to 140% at pH 10, but no activation at pH 8 (Figure 4B).; 
Figure 5 shows the activity (initial rates of SGZ product formation) of cotA from B. subtilis and B. clausii as a function of both NaCl concentration and pH.; (A) B. subtilis cotA; (B) B. clausii cotA; (C) Intersection at 400 mM NaCl and (D) intersection at 1000 mM NaCl, with B. clausii cotA in full lines and B. subtilis cotA in broken lines.;  From these figures, it is more clear that the cotA from B. subtilis loses activity quickly above pH 8, whereas the cotA from B. clausii preserves substantial activity at higher pH, consistent with the results from the activity profiles vs. pH, Figure 2.;  However, activation has been observed up to 150% for natively expressed cotA in B. subtilis spores at 80°C [15], and activation up to 130% has been observed at 37°C for B. pumilius laccase [58], which is within the optimal temperature range for growth of the native host.; Introduction of a lysine into B. subtilis HR03 CotA [59] has been shown to significantly increase the potential heat activation to an extreme 900%. This was explained by the introduction of a new ionic interaction between two domains.;  The profiles were fitted with a Gaussian using a mean pH of 7.7 and an amplitude of 30.8 for B. subtilis cotA and 8.1 and 4.0 for B. clausii cotA, respectively.;  Our KM derived from non-linear fitting at pH 7 was 0.34 mM for cotA from B. subtilis, somewhat larger than the 0.23 mM determined by Durao et al. [40] As outlined in the supporting information (Figures S6 and S7 in File S1), DMP kinetics give rise to substrate inhibition.;  The values of kcat deduced from the analysis (Figure 6) are for B. subtilis cotA ∼6 s−1 at pH 6 and ∼2 s−1 at pH 8 and for B. clausii cotA 1 s−1 at pH 6 and 5 s−1 at pH 8.;  The reported kcat of B. subtilis cotA is in the lower end of the previously reported range 7–30 s−1 at pH 7 [40]. The kcat/KM curves generally follow the pH-dependent activities of Figure 2.;  The kcat/KM values resulting from Gaussian fitting (Figure 6) are 10-fold higher for B. subtilis cotA, suggesting that the alkali-salt tolerance discussed above has been achieved at the expense of catalytic proficiency.;  Moreover, since we performed the Michaelis-Menten analysis at various pH-values, we also observed that this inhibition is absent at acidic pH but initiates at pH∼6 for B. subtilis cotA and at pH∼7 for B. clausii cotA.; We have reported the cloning, expression and characterization of a cotA from B. clausii, strictly benchmarked against its well-known ortholog from B. subtilis, expressed heterologously and characterized fully in parallel.;  We find that cotA from B. clausii has a shift in optimal pH for oxidation of phenolic substrates and a high salt resistance at high pH, compared to its ortholog from B. subtilis.; The stabilities of the two enzymes were substantial, with half-times of inactivation of 50 and 20 minutes for cotAs from B. subtilis and B. clausii, respectively, at pH 8 and 80°C.; The additional proficiency of cotA from B. clausii could be due to substitutions relative to its B. subtilis ortholog that may repel anion inhibitors in the water exit channel (notably V110E, Figure 1), although this requires further investigation, as does the complex interplay between pH and salt.;  While this shift is consistent with higher alkali-salt tolerance and potentially explained by increased anion repulsion in the water exit channel, this tolerance has been at the expense of 10-fold lower kcat/KM (DMP) compared to cotA from B. subtilis.;

Since expression and handling protocols affect protein activation and consequently observed activities, as shown in this paper, to enable a strict benchmark for characterization, we simultaneously characterized the cotA from Bacillus subtilis 168 after expressing it in the same E. coli strain."
B. pseudofirmus OF4,398511,18048917,2556953," Here, immunofluorescence microscopy and fluorescent protein fusion studies showed that an alkaliphile protein (designated McpX) that cross-reacts with antibodies raised against Bacillus subtilis McpB co-localizes with NaVBP at the cell poles of B. pseudofirmus OF4.;  A mutant of B. pseudofirmus OF4 was constructed in which cheAW expression was disrupted to assess whether this mutation impaired polar localization of McpX, as expected from studies in Escherichia coli and Salmonella, and, if so, whether NaVBP would be similarly affected.;  In our initial studies, we therefore turned to B. pseudofirmus OF4, in which the ncbA gene that encodes the NaChBac homologue NaVBP could be deleted in order to probe the physiological roles of the channel (Ito et al., 2004b).; B. pseudofirmus OF4 grows on non-fermentative carbon sources in a pH range from 7.5 to > 11.; Schematic diagram of the Na+ cycle of alkaliphilic B. pseudofirmus OF4.; Bioenergetic studies on an ncbA mutant of B. pseudofirmus OF4, lacking NaVBP, showed that the channel plays a role in Na+ re-entry in support of pH homeostasis at pH 10.5 under low [Na+] conditions and low concentrations of solutes whose entry is coupled to Na+. The ncbA mutant also displayed a motility defect at high pH even though it possessed the motPS genes that are a required stator-force generating Na+ channel required for flagella rotation (Ito et al., 2004a; Ito et al., 2004b).;  If NaVBP interacts with polar MCPs and/or the kinase/adaptor proteins that are complexed with them in B. pseudofirmus OF4, the channels should also localize to the cell poles.;  We conducted an immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) analysis of B. pseudofirmus OF4 cells to confirm the polar localization of MCPs and compare it with the localization pattern of NaVBP.;  Channel localization was also probed using a plasmid expressing a NaVBP-cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) fusion protein in B. pseudofirmus OF4.;  Alkaliphilic B. pseudofirmus OF4 wild-type (strain 811M) (Clejan et al., 1989) and its derivative strains were grown aerobically in semi-defined malate-yeast extract (MYE) medium (pH 10) (Sturr et al., 1994) at 37°C. pH 10 medium replaced the pH 10.5 medium used in most of our studies because the SC34 strain that lacked a functional NaVBP exhibited a significant deficit in mid-logarithmic growth at the higher pH value; earlier studies of SC34 growth had examined yield at stationary phase and a defect at high pH was not observed (Ito et al., 2004b).;  Two independent PCRs were performed on B. pseudofirmus OF4 wild-type chromosomal DNA template with the primer sets del-AW-F1-BH1 and del-AW-R1, del-AW-F2 and del-AW-R2-ER1.;  The plasmid was transformed into B. pseudofirmus OF4-811M protoplasts.;  Two independent PCRs were performed on B. pseudofirmus OF4 wild-type chromosomal DNA template with the primer sets NC-F1-SC2 and NC-R1-1, NC-F2-1 and NC-R2-BH1.;  The schematic diagram of the ncbA locus of wild-type B. pseudofirmus OF4 chromosome indicates the primers used in construction of a ncbA-ecfp fragment (A) and ecfp fragment (B) by PCR.;  The plasmids were transformed into B. pseudofirmus OF4-SC34 protoplasts (Ito et al., 1997).; B. pseudofirmus OF4 wild-type and its derivative mutant strains were grown overnight on MYE medium as described above. 1 ml of overnight culture was inoculated into 100 ml of fresh MYE medium pH 10, and grown to OD600=0.6.; The following antibodies and reagents were used for detection in immunoblot analyses: for McpB (B. subtilis) and McpX (B. pseudofirmus OF4), 1/2000 rabbit anti-B. subtilis McpB antibody and 1/3000 Goat anti-Rabbit HRP (Bio-Rad); and for NaVBP-CFP and CFP, 1/250 (whole cell analyses) or 1/1000 (membrane fraction analyses) rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Clontech), 1/3000 Goat anti Rabbit HRP (Bio-Rad), and Can Get SignalTM Immunoreaction Enhancer Solution (TOYOBO).; The method described by Hiraga et al. (Hiraga et al., 1998) was adapted for B. pseudofirmus OF4 strains.; B. pseudofirmus OF4-SC34 cells (ΔncbA) were transformed with plasmid pSC-CFP (yielding the SC34/pSC-CFP transformant) or pCFP (yielding the SC34/pCFP transformant).;  B. pseudofirmus OF4 wild-type and its derivative mutant strains were grown in MYE medium overnight and then grown to logarithmic phase on MYE, pH 10, as described above.;  Migration assay of B. pseudofirmus OF4 wild-type and its derivative strains in soft agar were conducted on plates containing MYE medium (pH 10) (Sturr et al., 1994) and solidified by the addition of 0.3% Noble agar.; B. pseudofirmus OF4 wild-type and its derivative strains were grown as described above.; The MCPs of B. pseudofirmus OF4, and the genes encoding them, have not yet been characterized, because the genome-sequence of this microorganism has not been determined.;  Before undertaking IFM, confirmation was sought that anti-B. subtilis McpB antibody could detect an MCP of B. pseudofirmus OF4 by assessing the heterogeneity of any cross-reacting proteins in the alkaliphile on immunoblot analyses (Fig. 3).;  In whole cells of wild type B. pseudofirmus OF4 (811M), a single band was detected at almost the same location as McpB of B. subtilis 168.;  We designated this MCP of B. pseudofirmus OF4 as McpX.; Immunoblot analyses of B. subtilis 168 McpB and B. pseudofirmus OF4 McpX in whole cells.;  The location of bands for McpB in B. subtilis 168 and McpX in B. pseudofirmus OF4 wild-type and its mutant derivatives SC34, SC34R and 811M-cheAW are indicated with an arrow.; IFM of NaVBP and McpX was then conducted in B. pseudofirmus OF4 wild-type and its mutant derivatives to assess the localization of these proteins.; Immunofluorescence microscopy analyses of the cellular localization of NaVBP and McpX in B. pseudofirmus OF4.;  Evidence against this line of reasoning was the earlier observation that the NaVBP channel inhibitor nifedipine caused inverse chemotaxis behavior of wild-type B. pseudofirmus OF4 toward the chemoattractant aspartate when the inhibitor added to the chemotaxis assay buffer (at 50 μM) (Ito et al., 2004b).; Transformants of B. pseudofirmus OF4-SC34 (ΔncbA) cells with plasmid pSC-CFP (SC34/pSC-CFP), in which CFP is fused to the channel, or control pCFP (SC34/pCFP) were grown in MYE, pH 10, and subjected to immunoblot analyses using antibodies against GFP.; Immunoblot analyses of NaVBP-CFP and CFP in whole cells and membrane fractions of B. pseudofirmus OF4 wild-type and its mutant derivatives.; Migration assays in soft agar and observations of the tumbling bias in liquid medium were conducted on B. pseudofirmus OF4 wild-type and its derivative mutant strains to ascertain whether the effects of ncbA status on polar localization of McpX correlated with swarming capacity in soft agar and tumbliness (Fig. 7, Table 5).; Migration assay of B. pseudofirmus OF4 wild-type and its derivative strains in soft agar.; Swarming assay and tumbling bias of B. pseudofirmus OF4 strains; NaVBP had earlier been shown to have a role in pH homeostasis, motility and chemotaxis in B. pseudofirmus OF4 (Ito et al., 2004b).;  This raises the possibility that the lag in motility in the channel mutant could be a result of sub-optimal pH homeostasis since the pH range for optimal swimming of B. pseudofirmus OF4 is below the highest values for optimal non-fermentative growth (Fujinami et al., 2007).;  Rather, we hypothesize that the effect of NaVBP status on the chemotaxis behavior of B. pseudofirmus OF4 is related to the interaction between NaVBP and chemotaxis proteins.;  On the other hand, the pattern of NaVBP localization did not correlate well with the pattern of peritrichous flagellum location in wild-type B. pseudofirmus OF4.;  Perhaps association of NaVBP and McpX is sufficient to allow a low level of polar co-localization in B. pseudofirmus OF4.;  This supports the possibility that NaVBP-mediated fluctuations in membrane potential could play a role in the signaling pathway for chemotaxis of B. pseudofirmus OF4, as was raised for channels not yet identified in earlier studies of chemotaxis in Spirochaeta aurantia (Goulbourne & Greenberg, 1983) and E. coli (Tisa et al., 1993; Tisa et al., 2000)."

B. subtilis,1423,30266724,6238051," Using stratospheric balloon flights and a simulation chamber, we demonstrate that yeasts isolated from an extreme environment are capable of surviving all stressors found in the stratosphere, including intense UV irradiation, scoring an even higher survival than B. subtilis spores.;  Two strains, Naganishia (Cryptococcus) friedmannii 16LV2 and Exophiala sp. strain 15LV1, survived full exposures to the stratosphere in larger numbers than did B. subtilis spores.;  Using stratospheric balloon flights and a simulation chamber, we demonstrate that yeasts isolated from an extreme environment are capable of surviving all stressors found in the stratosphere, including intense UV irradiation, scoring an even higher survival than B. subtilis spores.;  Error bars represent the standard deviation between three distinct spots. **, only one spot of B. subtilis spores was recovered from the exposed assay of the first flight; *, no CFU observed for exposed H. watticus on both balloon flights.;  Desiccation and exposure to stratospheric conditions without UV nearly did not affect the viability of B. subtilis spores, as expected.; Differential decompression rates did not affect the survival of the desiccated yeasts and B. subtilis spores (Fig. 4B).;  Decompression assay A (40 min evacuating, 10 min plateau, 40 min venting) resembles the decompression rates observed at the balloon flight. (B) Survival of B. subtilis spores and tested yeasts to differential decompression rates.;  No significant differences were observed between treatments. (C) Differential cooling speeds used for the assays, in comparison with the balloon flight. (D) Survival of B. subtilis spores and tested yeasts to cooling down at the AstroCam and at the desiccator covered with dry ice.;  However, when considering a scenario where cells are fully exposed to all stratospheric conditions, including solar radiation, N. friedmannii and Exophiala sp. strain 15LV1 scored a greater survival than B. subtilis spores (Fig. 2A and ​andB),B), even in the simulation chamber assays (Fig. 3D), in which viability was already impaired due to desiccation and exposure to low temperatures (Fig. 4D).;  Desiccation is the first challenge faced by these yeasts, but not for metabolically inert B. subtilis spores, which are extremely resistant to this type of stress (34).;  This differs from B. subtilis spores, which can tolerate even abrupt desiccation events.; N. friedmannii 16LV2 and Exophiala sp. 15LV1 achieved a significant survival after direct exposure to the high-altitude atmospheric environment, including UV irradiation, even higher than the survival of B. subtilis spores (Fig. 2A and ​andB).B).;  The laboratory simulation was somewhat more lethal for the yeasts than the real exposure to the stratosphere (Fig. 2 and ​and3D),3D), although N. friedmannii and Exophiala sp. 15LV1 still recorded a higher survival than B. subtilis spores at the full simulation with UV exposure.;  Independently of this explanation, an interesting observation can be made, in that B. subtilis spores seem to be indifferent to such variations to low temperature stresses, but yeast cell viability is likely to be more affected.; Importantly, these data highlight that survival in desiccation and low temperature is a key factor dictating the final survival of yeasts to stratosphere exposure, whereas for B. subtilis spores, these factors seem less important (Fig. 4), and UV plays a more relevant role in final survival (Fig. 2).;  Nevertheless, even considering the more extensive loss in viability to desiccation and low temperature, N. friedmannii and Exophiala sp. 15LV1 still survived exposure to full stratospheric conditions under our simulated conditions, more so than did B. subtilis spores (Fig. 3D), probably due to the remarkably high UV resistance of these yeasts.;  Nevertheless, considering that the stratospheric full-exposure assays (Fig. 1 and ​and2)2) and the stratosphere simulation (Fig. 3) deeply affected the B. subtilis spores to near-complete inactivation (5-log drop in viability), the survival observed for the yeasts was remarkably high.;  The achieved survival rates were even higher than those of B. subtilis spores, which are commonly studied as potential spacecraft contaminants in the context of planetary protection within the field of astrobiology (24).;  CFU were quantified on YM plates (malt extract, 3 g · liter−1; yeast extract, 3 g · liter−1; peptone, 5 g · liter−1; glucose, 10 g · liter−1; agar, 20 g · liter−1) for the yeasts and on LB plates (tryptone, 10 g · liter−1; yeast extract, 5 g · liter−1; NaCl, 10 g · liter−1; agar, 15 g · liter−1) for B. subtilis.; The cultures were centrifuged, washed twice with a 0.9% (wt/vol) NaCl solution, and diluted, if necessary, to reach a suspension with a final concentration of ∼5 × 107 CFU · ml−1 for the yeasts and ∼2 × 108 CFU · ml−1 for the B. subtilis spores.;  Also, parts of the exposed samples were lost during landing (spots from B. subtilis and a complete loss of other exposed microorganisms not discussed in this work).;  UV fluxes were calibrated according to the UV parameters used by Smith et al.

(B) Survival of B. subtilis spores and tested yeasts to differential decompression rates.;  No significant differences were observed between treatments. (C) Differential cooling speeds used for the assays, in comparison with the balloon flight. (D) Survival of B. subtilis spores and tested yeasts to cooling down at the AstroCam and at the desiccator covered with dry ice.; The viability of Bacillus subtilis spores remained virtually unaffected when exposed to stratospheric parameters while shielded from solar radiation, whereas for all yeasts, even the most resistant ones, a decrease in cell viability during stratospheric conditions without UV irradiation was observed (Fig. 2 to ​to4).4).;  Therefore, when considering a scenario where cells are shielded from UV, spores scored a better survival than with yeasts.;  H. watticus had a large reduction in its viability, even without solar radiation exposure, and suffered total inactivation when exposed to UV, demonstrating that this yeast does not seem to be adapted to aerial transport and stratospheric exposure, even considering UV-shielded cells.;  Desiccation is the first challenge faced by these yeasts, but not for metabolically inert B. subtilis spores, which are extremely resistant to this type of stress (34).;  The yeasts N. friedmannii and Exophiala sp. 15LV1 were shown to have a reasonable resistance toward desiccation, even as vegetative cells.;  Survival, as obtained in our results (using a suspension of washed cells), was only achieved by using stationary-phase cultures, high cell densities, and low dehydration rates, factors already known to improve the resistance of yeasts toward desiccation (35).;  Even the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, considered to be desiccation tolerant, requires high cell densities at the stationary phase to survive this type of treatment (35, 36).;  These yeasts were already shown to possess high resistance to UV-C, UV-B, and environmental UV radiation (UV-A + UV-B) under laboratory conditions (30).;  Considering that UV is the most deleterious factor to cells exposed to high altitudes (12), broad UV resistance probably is a key factor in tolerating the stratospheric environment and might account for the survival observed for our yeasts (Fig. 2A and ​andB).B).;  It is supposed that other still-uncharacterized protection systems may play a role in this yeast's UV tolerance.;  The exception of our group of extremophilic yeasts was H. watticus 16LV1, which presented a large loss in viability upon desiccation, increased loss in viability after exposure to low pressure and temperature, and complete loss in viability after UV exposure (Fig. 2).;  The laboratory simulation was somewhat more lethal for the yeasts than the real exposure to the stratosphere (Fig. 2 and ​and3D),3D), although N. friedmannii and Exophiala sp. 15LV1 still recorded a higher survival than B. subtilis spores at the full simulation with UV exposure.;  The main observed difference is due to the increased lethality during the desiccation plus stratosphere treatment, which reduced the viability of the tested yeasts 1 to 1.5 log at the simulation chamber (Fig. 3D), compared to 0.2- to 0.3-log reductions at the balloon flights (Fig. 2).;  Interestingly, we observed that the yeasts' survival inside the cooled desiccator is similar to the observed survival at the balloon flights (Fig. 4D and ​and2),2), whereas the cooling system used in the AstroCam was significantly more lethal to the yeast cells (Fig. 4D).;  Independently of this explanation, an interesting observation can be made, in that B. subtilis spores seem to be indifferent to such variations to low temperature stresses, but yeast cell viability is likely to be more affected.; Importantly, these data highlight that survival in desiccation and low temperature is a key factor dictating the final survival of yeasts to stratosphere exposure, whereas for B. subtilis spores, these factors seem less important (Fig. 4), and UV plays a more relevant role in final survival (Fig. 2).;  Nevertheless, even considering the more extensive loss in viability to desiccation and low temperature, N. friedmannii and Exophiala sp. 15LV1 still survived exposure to full stratospheric conditions under our simulated conditions, more so than did B. subtilis spores (Fig. 3D), probably due to the remarkably high UV resistance of these yeasts.; It is important, however, to note that probably not all extremophilic yeast groups are equally fit for air transportation.;  As our data showed, H. watticus suffered a great loss in viability already upon desiccation, which is the most critical step for yeasts for airborne transportation (Fig. 2 and ​and3).3).;  It is an interesting observation considering that this yeast, although not as resistant to UV as N. friedmannii 16LV1 and Exophiala sp. 15LV1 under laboratory conditions, was isolated from a high-elevation volcanic area in the Atacama Desert and nevertheless presented a considerable UV resistance in our previous study (30).;  In fact, even when considering the best survival of our yeasts, exposure to the total stratospheric environment still inactivated about 90% of the viable cells of N. friedmannii and Exophiala sp. 15LV1 (Fig. 2, at the second and first flight for each yeast, respectively).;  Therefore, it is likely that prolonged exposure to stratospheric UV would have a greater impact on the survival of our yeasts, reducing their viability even more.;  Also, desiccation followed by a low-temperature treatment seems to affect more yeasts than bacterial spores (Fig. 4).;  Nevertheless, considering that the stratospheric full-exposure assays (Fig. 1 and ​and2)2) and the stratosphere simulation (Fig. 3) deeply affected the B. subtilis spores to near-complete inactivation (5-log drop in viability), the survival observed for the yeasts was remarkably high.;  These results strengthen previous assumptions that yeasts, like N. friedmannii and Exophiala sp. 15LV1, can be good eukaryotic models for astrobiology (30, 31).;  In addition, in our previous study, Exophiala sp. 15LV1 scored the highest survival for UV-C and UV-B of our tested yeasts (30), and here, we show that it can endure several conditions found in a Mars-like environment.;  Once sequences are available, deeper molecular investigations, including classic molecular biology approaches (e.g., gene deletion, overexpression, and heterologous gene expression in other yeasts) will be possible, allowing a better understanding of the mechanisms of N. friedmannii to cope with multiple stress conditions and to expand our knowledge about the limits of eukaryotic life.; The yeasts Exophiala sp. 15LV1, Naganishia friedmannii 16LV2 (formerly Cryptococcus friedmannii), and Holtermanniella watticus 16LV1, previously isolated from a volcanic region at the Atacama Desert (30), were grown in GYMP broth (glucose, 20 g · liter−1; yeast extract, 5 g · liter−1; malt extract, 5 g · liter−1; NaH2PO4, 2 g · liter−1) at 15°C into the late-stationary phase, which corresponds to roughly 20 days of growth (Fig.;  CFU were quantified on YM plates (malt extract, 3 g · liter−1; yeast extract, 3 g · liter−1; peptone, 5 g · liter−1; glucose, 10 g · liter−1; agar, 20 g · liter−1) for the yeasts and on LB plates (tryptone, 10 g · liter−1; yeast extract, 5 g · liter−1; NaCl, 10 g · liter−1;

P. euphratica,75702,35587636,9241684," The research showed that endophytic bacteria of P. euphratica in an extremely saline environment had low species diversity, especially in sap tissue.;  The predictive analysis of KEGG pathways and enzymes showed that the abundance of some enzymes and metabolic pathways of endophytes of P. euphratica increased with the increase of soil salinity, and most of the enzymes were related to energy metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism.;  P. euphratica has a long growth cycle and a high growth rate, which can break wind, fix sand, green the environment, and protect farmland, making it an important afforestation tree species in arid and semiarid areas.;  The area of P. euphratica in Xinjiang accounts for 91.1% of its area in China.;  Studying the endophytic bacteria of P. euphratica can give people a systematic understanding of it and the adaptability of the endogenous flora to the host and special environments.;  In this study, by analyzing the endophytic bacteria of P. euphratica in different saline-alkali regions of Xinjiang, it was found that the bacteria in different tissues of P. euphratica changed with the change of soil salinity.;  Especially in the sap tissue of P. euphratica under extremely high salinity, the diversity of endogenous bacteria was significantly lower than that in other tissues.;  Not only that, we also selected a strain of Bacillus with high stress resistance from the tissues of P. euphratica, which can survive under the extreme conditions of 10% NaCl and pH 11.;  Therefore, this study was of great significance for the understanding of endophytic bacteria in P. euphratica and the acquisition of extremophilic microbial resources.;  P. euphratica has a long growth cycle and a high growth rate, which can break wind, fix sand, green the environment, and protect farmland, making it an important afforestation tree species in arid and semiarid areas (7).;  Due to the high adaptability of P. euphratica to the extreme desert environment, it has become an important model species for studying the effects of abiotic stresses on trees (8).;  Research on the molecular biology of P. euphratica has made progress in genetic diversity (9) and functional genes, genome, and transcriptomics (10).; However, the research on the endogenous bacteria of P. euphratica mainly focuses on the isolation and identification of culturable endophytic microorganisms (12) and the performance of single bacteria isolated from Populus euphratica (13), while the understanding of the diversity and community structure of its endophytic bacteria is still lacking.;  In China, P. euphratica is primarily distributed in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Gansu, and Ningxia.;  Among them, the area of P. euphratica growth in Xinjiang accounts for 91.1% of its growth in China.;  Studying the endophytic bacteria of P. euphratica can give people a systematic understanding of it and the adaptability of the endogenous flora to the host and special environments.; Therefore, this study analyzed the endophytic bacteria of P. euphratica on different saline-alkali soils in Xinjiang, observed whether the endophytic bacterium was stable or changed with the increase of the salt-alkali concentration, and clarified whether the endogenous bacteria of P. euphratica were related only to its own saline-alkali environment or would alter with variations in the external environment.;  If there is a change, is it related to the function of the endophytic bacteria? The findings could provide clues for the systematic recognition of endogenous bacterial groups in P. euphratica, especially the response of endophytic bacteria to the changes of salt environment, and the description of the interaction between the environment and the endogenous bacteria of the plant.; We collected and detected the physicochemical properties of the soils where P. euphratica grows, and the results showed that SO42− and Cl− were the predominant anions in the soils from both areas.;  Since P. euphratica grows poorly in a hot, moist climate and heavy clay soil, it mostly lives in a dry climate (14).;  We did not observe the growth of P. euphratica in healthy soil under the natural environment of Xinjiang, so we could compare the differences in the endophytic microbial community of P. euphratica only under various salinities.;  There was no way to use P. euphratica grown in nonsaline soil as a control.; In order to understand the endophytic microbial community of P. euphratica in different saline environments, we analyzed the alpha diversity index of each sample by MiSeq high-throughput sequencing, including the read numbers, coverage, Shannon index, and Chao index of each sample at a genetic distance of 3% (Table 2).;  The samples collected from the P. euphratica forest can be divided into three types: sap, xylem, and soil.; Alpha diversity index of each sample of P. euphratica;  The results showed that the Shannon index and Chao index of the sap tissue of P. euphratica under extremely high salinity were modest compared with other groups, indicating that its microbial number and diversity were both lower.;  However, the Shannon and Chao indexes of xylem and soil samples of P. euphratica under different salinities did not differ greatly.;  Therefore, we can speculate that when the soil salinity is too high, it will affect the diversity of the endogenous bacteria of the sap tissue of P. euphratica but will not have much impact on the xylem.; For further investigation of the composition of endophytic bacteria in each tissue sample of P. euphratica under different salinities, we constructed a Venn diagram to identify the number of OTUs presented in these groups (Fig. 1).;  For the different tissues of P. euphratica under various salinities (Fig. 1B), the sap tissue of P. euphratica under extremely high salinity had the fewest OTUs (218), which was consistent with the results of alpha diversity analysis.; Comparison of OTUs of P. euphratica under different salinities (A) and from different tissues (B) by Venn diagram (sequence similarity greater than 97% is classified as an OTU).;  Figure 2 showed the community composition at the phylum level in varied tissues (Fig. 2A) and different salinities (Fig. 2B to ​toE)E) of P. euphratica (combining the species that account for less than 1% of the abundance in the sample as “others”).; Microbiota composition of different tissues (A) and different salinities (B to E) of P. euphratica at phylum level (the phyla that account for less than 1% of the abundance in the sample are merged into “others”).; From the bar chart (Fig. 2A), we can see that the endophytes of P. euphratica were mainly concentrated in 13 phyla including Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Deinococcus-Thermus, Verrucomicrobia, Gemmatimonadetes, Saccharibacteria, Planctomycetes, Cyanobacteria, Parcubacteria, and Acidobacteria.; It is worth noting that Firmicutes was another dominant phylum in the tissues of P. euphratica, and the relative abundance ranged from 0.25% to 25.36% (Fig. 2A).;  From the higher abundance of Firmicutes, it can be inferred that the high-saline environment will affect the composition of the endophytic microbiota of P. euphratica, and the Firmicutes with high stress resistance can survive to a greater degree in a high-pH and high-salt environment, so that P. euphratica can survive better under these conditions, too.; In previous research in the laboratory, 44 strains of cultivable endophytic bacteria were screened and identified from the tissue of P. euphratica by using LB medium with a salt content of 3%, and they belonged to 5 genera, namely, Bacillus, Planococcus, Nesterenkonia of Firmicutes, Oerskovia of Actinobacteria, and Halomonas of Proteobacteria.;  Therefore, we speculated that the Firmicutes containing Bacillus were of great significance for the endophytes of P. euphratica and the host’s resistance to a saline-alkali environment.; There was also a special phylum, Deinococcus-Thermus, in the tissues of P. euphratica.;  Moreover, its relative abundance was the highest in the sap and xylem of the moderate saline group of P. euphratica, reaching 7.15% and 5.32%, respectively (Fig. 2A).;  The high abundance of Deinococcus-Thermus in the tissues of P. euphratica in semiarid areas with moderate salinity indicated that this phylum was drought tolerant but not saline tolerant.;  Cluster analysis showed that endophytic flora of the tissues of P. euphratica under the same salinity had a correlation.;  The dominant genera of sap of P. euphratica under extreme salinity were very different from those of other groups, including Nesterenkonia, unclassified_f_Micrococcaceae, unclassified_f_Carnobacteriaceae, Bogoriella, Alkalibacterium, and Cellulomonas.;  Cellulomonas in sap of P. euphratica under extreme salinity can produce xylanase to degrade cellulose (32).; It can also be seen from the principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA) results that the microbial community of P. euphratica under different salinities had an obvious trend of separation, indicating that with the change of salinity of soil, the microbial community will change accordingly (Fig. 4).;  The separation trend of sap samples ZP_1 and ZP_2 of P. euphratica under extreme salinity compared with other samples was very obvious, indicating that the community composition structure was very different, and the same was true for the alpha diversity (Table 2) and community composition at the phylum level (Fig. 2A) and the genus level (Fig. 3).;  This may be due to the special growth environment of P. euphratica.;  In order to adapt to the high-saline-alkali environment, P. euphratica removes the excess salt absorbed in the soil into white crystals on the trunk or branches to maintain its own osmotic balance.;  Therefore, the salinity of the sap of P. euphratica is relatively high, resulting in a great difference between the microbial community structure of the sap and that of other tissues.; Principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA) using Bray-Curtis metric distances of beta diversity in the samples of P. euphratica from different salinities at the OTU level.; However, although the diversity of the tissue of P. euphratica was reduced under extremely high salinity, most of the surviving bacteria were associated with salinity tolerance.;  Culturable bacteria such as Bacillus and Halomonas screened from the tissue of P. euphratica in the early stage of the laboratory work also had literature showing that they can improve the salt tolerance of plants as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (33).;  Therefore, based on the data of this study and combined with the reported data, we support the idea that endophytes with low diversity can still improve the salinity tolerance of P. euphratica under extremely high salinity.; The above results suggested that different salinity will affect the composition of the endogenous microbial community of P. euphratica.;  Some stress-resistant bacteria in P. euphratica can better help it resist the external stress environment.;  For example, the highly abundant Firmicutes of P. euphratica under high salinity can help it resist extreme conditions by producing endospores.;  The high-abundance Deinococcus-Thermus in tissues of P. euphratica with moderate salinity are not salt tolerant but are tolerant of drought, high temperature, and radiation.;  Some salt-tolerant or alkali-tolerant bacteria such as Nesterenkonia, Bogoriella, Alkalibacterium, Cellulomonas, and Cytophagaceae that exist in tissues of P. euphratica under extreme salinity will have potential application value if they can be used well.; Since the endogenous bacterial community of P. euphratica would change with the change of environmental salinity, we used the PICRUSt2 (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) tool to predict the function of endophytic bacteria of P. euphratica and compared the microbial metabolic functional abundances in different salinity groups.; Based on the results, we can see that the abundance of some predicted enzymes and metabolic pathways of endophytes of P. euphratica changed with the change of soil salinity (Tables 3 and ​and4).4).; As mentioned above, we screened a salt-tolerant strain, Bacillus haynesii P19, from the tissue of P. euphratica.; In this study, we report the endogenous bacterial community structure of P. euphratica in different saline environments.; We compared the differences of microorganisms in different salinities; alpha diversity showed that the endogenous bacterial diversity of P. euphratica in different saline environments and different tissues was varied; in particular, the Shannon index and Chao index of the sap of P. euphratica under extreme salinity were lower than those in other groups.;  At the phylum level, in the endophytes of P. euphratica, the high-abundance Firmicutes under high salinity can form endospores to resist extreme conditions.;  At the genus level, the dominant genera of sap of P. euphratica under extreme salinity were very different from those of other groups, almost all of which were related to saline-alkali tolerance.;  The LEfSe analysis suggested that the endogenous bacteria in P. euphratica were significantly varied at the different taxonomic levels, indicating that the different growth environments of P. euphratica can affect the abundance of its endogenous bacteria.; By predicting the function of endophytic bacteria of P. euphratica, we found that the abundance of some enzymes and metabolic pathways of endophytes of P. euphratica increased with the increase of soil salinity.; The saline-alkali-tolerant strain Bacillus haynesii P19 screened from the tissue of P. euphratica can still grow well under the conditions of 60 g/L NaCl and pH 10.; Taken together, this study has systematically described the endogenous bacterial flora of P. euphratica and compared the microbial divergences in different salinities.;  We found that different saline environments will affect the composition of the endogenous flora of P. euphratica.;  On the other hand, we found that the endophytes of P. euphratica may be involved in some of the metabolic pathways that tolerate salt stress.; We collected four samples of P. euphratica xylem, three samples of P. euphratica sap, and two samples of rhizosphere soil from a P. euphratica forest (high-saline soil) in Zephyr, Xinjiang, China (E76°57.935′, N38°01.848′), and collected four samples of P. euphratica xylem, three samples of P. euphratica sap, and two rhizosphere soil samples as controls from a P. euphratica forest (mild saline soil) in Darbancheng, Xinjiang, China (E87°91.531′, N43°52.026′).;  Since the location of the sample collection was in the P. euphratica forest reserve, in order to prevent the destruction of P. euphratica vegetation, we had no way to use traditional methods to collect samples, such as the five-point method, so we could select only typical samples to collect."

Due to its extreme geographical location and climatic conditions, the QTP has unique extreme ecosystems, characterized by oxygen deficiency, low temperatures, and intense ultraviolet radiation [2]. The rhizosphere of plants growing in the extreme environment could be a rich source of microbes with potential stress resistance and biocontrol properties [3]. Bacillus and Pseudomonas are potential biological control agents [4], and the application of biopesticide is an environmentally friendly alternative to chemical fertilizers [5].;  Extremophilic strains are continuously confronted with the physicochemical changes associated with extreme environments [3]. We previously isolated numerous Bacillus strains from the QTP.;  The Bacillus sp.; Phytopathogenic fungi severely reduce the yield of agricultural products, and the use of biological fertilizer offers a sustainable way of avoiding this problem [7]. The ability to produce diverse secondary metabolic compounds is the most outstanding biocontrol feature of the Bacillus species.;  Approximately 10% of the genes in the genome of the model biocontrol strain B. velezensis FZB42 are involved in the production of secondary metabolites, including polyketides, antimicrobial peptides and lipopeptides [8]. Lipopeptides are synthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) that are composed of large multi-enzyme complexes, and which play an important role in inhibiting phytopathogenic pathogens [9]. Preliminary results suggest that stress-tolerant representatives of the genus Bacillus play a major role in QTP ecosystems [6], and their biocontrol capability has been reported by our laboratory.;  The Bacillus strains isolated from Tibet such as B. halotolerans DGL6 and B. velezensis GBSW11 and DJFZ40 showed strong antagonistic activities towards Phytophthora capsica, Xanthomonas oryzae, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum [10].; The objective of this study was to isolate stress-tolerant Bacillus spp. from different plant rhizospheres in the QTP and analyze their stress resistance and biocontrol potential at the molecular level.;  The sequences of the Bacillus species were downloaded from the NCBI database (with a similarity criterion of >95%).;  In the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1), the strains clustered into four different species: Bacillus atrophaeus (19 strains), Bacillus velezensis (two strains), Bacillus thuringiensis (two strains), Bacillus subtilis (one strain) and Bacillus halotolerans (one strain).; Comparative genomic analysis of KKD1 with model Bacillus strains.

C. rosea,3825,35742848,9223760," In this study, we identified a total of 41 CrHsp20 genes in the C. rosea genome.;  However, some of the heat-upregulated CrHsp20 genes showed completely different expression patterns in response to salt, alkaline, or high osmotic stresses, which indicates their potential specific function in mediating the response of C. rosea to abiotic stresses.;  In addition, C. rosea is an extremophile halophyte, exhibiting excellent high salt/alkaline and drought tolerance [31], and is, therefore, being used as a ‘pioneering species’ for island greening, sand fixation, and ecological restoration in tropical and subtropical coral islands and coastal zones [32]. Notably, the tremendous growth potential under extreme adversity depends on the long-term adaptive evolution of these specialized habitat species, thereby generating specific GRNs and functional genes.; In the present study, we comprehensively identified and systematically analyzed the evolutionary relationships, gene duplication events, and the cis-acting elements of the promoter regions of the CrHsp20 family based on the availability of whole-genome sequence data for C. rosea.; To identify the CrHsp20 genes in the C. rosea genome, the Hidden Markov models (HMMs) profile of the HSP20 domain (PF00011) was taken from the protein family database and searched against the whole-genome database of C. rosea.;

 In general, the expression levels of all CrHsp20s in the C. rosea leaves seemed to be lowest compared with the other four samples, including root, stem, flower, and young fruit tissues (Figure 5A), which also indicate that CrHsp20s, being basic heat responsive genes, maintain low constitutive expression levels in the leaf, since the leaf is the most direct sensor of environmental heat.;  This was in accordance with the growth conditions, as the inland garden (SCBG) did provide a suitable environment for the C. rosea seedlings.;  Owing to this, we later also extracted the RNA-Seq data from mature leaf samples collected from adult C. rosea plants growing in the SCBG and on YX Island (a coral island located in the South China Sea, a native habitat for C. rosea plants), and the results show that at least 26 CrHsp20s were significantly highly expressed in the leaf samples from YX compared with those from the SCBG, while only several (CrHsp20-1, CrHsp20-24, and CrHsp20-31) showed a slightly opposite trend (Figure 5B).;  These results indicate that most CrHsp20s contribute greatly to the environmental adaptation of C. rosea plants to tropical coral islands.; Heatmaps showing (A) the expression levels of the 41 CrHsp20s in the root, stem, leaf, flower bud, and young fruit of C. rosea plant and (B) expression differences of the 41 CrHsp20s in mature C. rosea leaves planting in South China Botanical Garden (SCBG) and in Yongxing Island (YX).; Considering the complexity of the environmental conditions of XY, as well as the sampling of C. rosea tissues from Yongxing Island not being easy, we separately mimicked the main stressors of YX that could obviously affect plant growth and collected different tissues at different time points.;  To analyze the CrHsp20s involved in the response of C. rosea to these abiotic stresses, we analyzed the RNA-Seq data to assess the expression levels of the 41 CrHsp20s in the roots and leaves during the response to salinity, alkalinity, high osmotic stress, and heat (Figure 6).; Under high salinity stress, only some CrHsp20s (CrHsp20-8, CrHsp20-25, CrHsp20-26, and CrHsp20-28) showed obviously induced expression under a short-duration challenge in the C. rosea roots (2 h), while the levels of induction were further enhanced after a long-duration challenge (48 h).;  Conversely, it appeared that high osmotic stress (drought) caused the most significant change in the C. rosea roots at both the time points of 2 h and 48 h, which indicates that the CrHsp20 genes are deeply involved in the response to water deficit in the roots of C. rosea (Figure 6A,B).; Heat shock for 2 h significantly induced the expression of more than half of the CrHsp20 members in the C. rosea seedlings (Figure 7), and the transcripts of the CrHsp20s increased by tens of thousands-fold in both the roots and in the leaves, while several CrHsp20s showed slightly downregulated expression patterns in response to heat, including CrHsp20-1, CrHsp20-15, CrHsp20-18, CrHsp20-19, CrHsp20-21, CrHsp20-22, CrHsp20-23, CrHsp20-24, CrHsp20-32, CrHsp20-33, CrHsp20-36, CrHsp20-38, and CrHsp20-41.;  These results further indicate that the CrHsp20 family might be a key responsive factor involved in the thermotolerance of C. rosea plants to their native habitats.; Quantitative RT-PCR detection of the expression levels of the 14 CrHsp20s (CrHsp20-4, CrHsp20-5, CrHsp20-7, CrHsp20-8, CrHsp20-9, CrHsp20-10, CrHsp20-14, CrHsp20-25, CrHsp20-26, CrHsp20-27, CrHsp20-28, CrHsp20-31, CrHsp20-35, and CrHsp20-40) responding to different stresses (600 mM NaCl for salt stress, 150 mM NaHCO3 for alkaline stress, 300 mM mannitol for high osmotic stress, or heat stress at 45 °C) in C. rosea seedling plants.

(D) The expression patterns in leaves under alkaline treatment. (E) The expression patterns in roots under high osmotic stress treatment. (F) The expression patterns in leaves under high osmotic stress treatment. (G) The expression patterns in roots, stems, and leaves under heat stress.;  We only performed the short-duration heat challenge (2 h) for the C. rosea seedlings, since long-duration heat processing (>4 h) can cause obvious wilting.;  The variable expression patterns of these CrHsp20s suggests a divergence in biological functions during the adaptation of C. rosea to different abiotic challenges.;  Unexpectedly, the results showed that all seven CrHsp20s failed to relieve H2O2 toxicity even at relatively low H2O2 concentrations, either in skn7∆ (Figure 10A) or in yap1∆ (Figure 10B), which was quite different from other antioxidant genes, such as C. rosea CrMTs [39], or other plant sHsp genes, such as Rosa chinensis RcHSP17.8 [24]. These results indicate that C. rosea CrHsp20s might not be directly involved in scavenging ROS but may diminish severe harm from stress in other ways.;  Hsp20s, which are the most abundant Hsps found in plants, are small molecular chaperones that play important roles in plant growth and development, as well as being widely involved in abiotic stress tolerance, especially to heat stress [6,40,41]. Hsp20s can inhibit the irreversible aggregation of denaturing proteins and enhance cellular thermotolerance, thereby maintaining basic cellular activities and improving the adversity resistance of plants when challenged by heat or other stresses [6]. The halophyte C. rosea, belonging to the Fabaceae family, is one seashore halophyte plant that possesses multiple stress-resistant features.;  This plant has attracted increasing attention due to its strong tolerance to barren soil and can be used as a pioneer species for sand fixation, wind resistance, landscape greening, and ecological restoration in coral islands and coastal zones [31]. Even in extreme heat environments, C. rosea presents high biomass yield with minimum requirements for water and nutrition inputs, which suggests that C. rosea has evolved unique molecular and physiological mechanisms that allow it to tolerate persistent high temperature [32]. Using good-quality genome assemblies of C. rosea, we performed a detailed analysis of the CrHsp20 family in this species and identified their overall expression patterns, with the aim of elucidating their possible roles in the ecological adaptation of C. rosea to tropical coral reefs.; We identified a total of 41 CrHsp20 genes from the C. rosea genome, which could be divided into 11 clusters (CI, CII, CIII, CV, CVI, MI, MII, ER, P, PX/Po, and unclassified).;  Thirty-nine Hsp20 genes (Cc_sHsps) were identified in another leguminous plant, the pigeon pea [42]. Soybean possesses more GmHsp20 members in its genome (at least 51 member) [29], probably due to it being an ancient tetraploid that underwent two whole-genome duplications [43]. The classification of plant Hsp clusters is mainly dependent on the variable length N-terminal domain (NTD) or the specific targeting signal peptide (SP) before NTD in the N-terminus of some Hsp20 proteins, because the ACD and CTE located at the middle or C-terminus are more conserved [7,44]. For the phylogenetic tree construction, we only referenced 19 Arabidopsis AtHsp20 protein sequences that had been clearly identified and classified into different subfamilies [7,34]. Here we can see that compared with soybean [29] or rice [45] Hsp20 families, the CrHsp20 family also lacks the CIV members that are present in these two species, while the MI and MI subfamilies possess more members in C. rosea than they do in soybean and rice (Figure 1).;  Furthermore, gene duplication analysis revealed that both segmental and tandem duplications significantly contributed to the expansion of the CrHsp20s (Table 2 and Figure 3), resulting in a relatively large family of C. rosea Hsp20s.; Furthermore, the expression patterns of the CrHsp20s were investigated on the basis of their transcriptome data from various C. rosea tissues collected from different growth habitats, including the SCBG (good growing conditions for C. rosea seedlings) and YX (native special habitat).;  Numerous studies reported the positive role of Hsp20s in plant thermotolerance [24,25,26,27,28], and the typical characteristics of the native habitat of C. rosea include perennial high temperatures and strong light conditions.;  Given the intensity of sun light and environmental heat, as well as the complicated high salt/alkaline and water shortage on Yongxing Island (YX), this result further implies that CrHsp20s might act in abiotic stress responses in the native specialized habitat (YX) of C. rosea.; In addition to high temperature, C. rosea plants may also need to overcome the high salinity/alkalinity and persistent seasonal drought of sandy soil.;  In this study, we analyzed the expression patterns of CrHsp20s in C. rosea seedlings in response to various abiotic stresses and found that many differentially expressed CrHsp20s were significantly upregulated in response to these stresses, especially to heat (Figure 6 and Figure 7).;  The expression patterns of CtHSP20 genes were differentially regulated by multiple abiotic stresses [50]. In our research, the expression patterns of CrHsp20s were investigated in detail in C. rosea seedlings subjected to various multiple environmental factors associated with its native habitat, such as heat, high salinity, alkaline, and drought (water deficit).;  Considering that numerous reports have confirmed the positive correlation between the high expression of Hsp20s and good thermotolerance in plants, here we further speculate that the CrHsp20 family might participate in the regulation of the ecological adaptation of C. rosea regarding the multiple adversity on tropical coral islands, especially for extreme heat.; The overexpression of different Hsp20s in plants or microorganisms has been demonstrated by multiple studies to elevate stress tolerance [7]. Here we also amplified several CrHsp20s from the total cDNAs of the C. rosea plants and performed heterologous overexpression with a yeast system—a simple and rapid method for the exploration of the putative functions of genes in vivo.; Canavalia rosea adult plants growing in the South China Botanical Garden (SCBG, 23°18′76′′ N, 113°37′02′′ E, Guangzhou city, China) had been transplanted gradually from Hainan province, China since 2012, and C. rosea adult plants growing in Yongxing Island (YX, 16°83′93′′ N, 112°34′00′′ E) were also used in this study.;  The C. rosea seedlings were cultivated in the SCBG with seeds gathered from the coastal areas of Hainan province.;  In brief, the C. rosea seeds were germinated in pots filled with soil/vermiculite mixture and grown to seedlings for 30 days in a growth chamber or until they were flowering and bearing fruits outdoors in the SCBG.; To perform the RNA-Seq analysis, the C. rosea roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits were gathered from seedlings or adult plants growing in the SCBG to obtain the tissue-specific transcriptional patterns of the identified CrHsp20s.;  Adult leaves were then gathered from C. rosea plants growing in both YX and the SCBG to investigate the involvement of the CrHsp20s in adaptation to different habitats.;  For abiotic stress-related RNA-Seq analysis, the 30-day-old C. rosea seedlings were removed from the pots and carefully cleaned, following which they were transferred into 600 mM NaCl solution (1/2 Hoagland’s) for high-salinity stress.;  For salt–alkaline stress, the cleaned C. rosea seedlings were soaked in a 150 mM NaHCO3 (pH 8.2) solution (1/2 Hoagland’s).;  The C. rosea seedlings placed in 1/2 Hoagland’s solution for different time points (0, 2 h, 48 h) were used as the control.;  At certain time points (0, 2 h, 48 h), the C. rosea tissues were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, following which the samples were stored at −80 °C for subsequent RNA-Seq analysis.; The assembled genome data of C. rosea (GenBank accession no.: JACXSB000000000, which will be released on 16 September 2024) were annotated with InterPro and Pfam for gene family identification with conserved domains and motifs (e < 1 × 10−5).;  Finally, candidate CrHsp20s were named based on their gene locus referred to in the C. rosea genome annotation.;  The chromosomal position of each CrHsp20 gene was acquired and mapped from MG2C (MapGene2Chrom, http://mg2c.iask.in/mg2c_v2.0/, accessed on 21 March 2022) according to the whole-genome sequencing information of C. rosea.; The coding sequences, genomic sequences, promoter sequences (ATG upstream 1000 bp), and amino acid sequences of the CrHsp20 genes were downloaded from the C. rosea genome database.; The cis-acting elements in the 1000 bp upstream sequences (listed in Table S1) of the coding region of the C. rosea Hsp20 genes were retrieved from the genome, and the types, numbers, and functions of these elements were analyzed using PlantCARE software (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/, accessed on 21 March 2022).; The RNA-Seq libraries were prepared for all C. rosea tissues and were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Oebiotech Company, Shanghai, China).;  Clean reads were mapped to the C. rosea reference genome using Tophat v.2.0.10 (http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/, accessed on 21 March 2022).; Total RNA was extracted from each C. rosea tissue sample using a plant RNA extraction kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.;  The selected full-length CrHsp20 cDNA was PCR-amplified from C. rosea seedling cDNA using the gene-specific primers listed in Table S2.; In this study, C. rosea CrHsp20 genes were systematically and comprehensively analyzed based on genome sequencing data.;  Our study provides comprehensive information on the CrHsp20 gene family and should improve our understanding of the functional divergence of Hsp20 genes in C. rosea.;  The systematic characterization of the CrHsp20 family not only provides a meaningful overview of this gene family, but also contributes toward illuminating the heat resistant mechanism of this specialized plant and even the adaptability of C. rosea to other stress conditions.;  The authors also thank several workers who planted the Canavalia rosea plants in the South China Botanical Garden (Guangzhou city, China) and gathered C. rosea seeds from Hainan province, China."
Canavalia rosea,3825,35742848,9223760," Canavalia rosea is an extremophile halophyte with good adaptability to environmental high temperature and is widely distributed in coastal areas or islands in tropical and subtropical regions.;  Canavalia rosea (Sw.) DC. (Fabaceae) is a representative pantropical coastal plant species with sea-drifted seeds and a wide distribution in tropical and subtropical regions [30]. Canavalia rosea exhibits better heat tolerance than most other plant species and great growth potential even under nutrient-deficient conditions on tropical coral reefs.; Nomenclature and subcellular localization of heat-shock protein 20 identified from Canavalia rosea.; Canavalia rosea adult plants growing in the South China Botanical Garden (SCBG, 23°18′76′′ N, 113°37′02′′ E, Guangzhou city, China) had been transplanted gradually from Hainan province, China since 2012, and C. rosea adult plants growing in Yongxing Island (YX, 16°83′93′′ N, 112°34′00′′ E) were also used in this study.;  The authors also thank several workers who planted the Canavalia rosea plants in the South China Botanical Garden (Guangzhou city, China) and gathered C. rosea seeds from Hainan province, China."
yeast,4932,35742848,9223760," In addition, some of CrHsp20s were cloned and functionally characterized for their roles in abiotic stress tolerance in yeast.;  Additionally, some heat-responsive CrHsp20 genes were selected to verify their functions in yeast strains using transgenic technology.; To further analyze the functions of the CrHsp20s, we performed eukaryotic expression analysis in yeast.;  We successfully cloned seven CrHsp20 cDNAs, namely CrHsp20-8, CrHsp20-12, CrHsp20-13, CrHsp20-16, CrHsp20-25, CrHsp20-26, and CrHsp20-27, and produced CrHsp20 overexpression yeast vectors with pYES2.; First, we performed the thermotolerance test for yeast strains overexpressing CrHsp20s, and the yeast cultures were subjected to 52 °C for heat stress and shifted to 30 °C for recovery, following which they were gradient-diluted and spotted on SDG plates.;  Our results demonstrated that the cell viability decreased in the H2O2-sensitive mutant strain skn7Δ harboring the empty vector pYES2 after the HS challenge (52 °C for 15 min), while the WT yeast grew normally.;  Skn7Δ has been confirmed as being sensitive to acute heat stress, probably by acting together with yeast heat shock factors [37]. The skn7Δ cells expressing seven CrHsp20s always survived better than those harboring pYES2 (Figure 9), indicating that CrHsp20s, being molecular chaperones, are thought to protect the cell during exposure to lethal heat stress, although their exact function remains unclear.; The thermotolerance confirmation of seven CrHsp20s (CrHsp20-8, CrHsp20-12, CrHsp20-13, CrHsp20-16, CrHsp20-25, CrHsp20-26, and CrHsp20-27) using heteroexpression in yeast.;  The yeast cultures were adjusted to OD600 = 2 firstly, then were incubated at 52 °C for 15 min and moved to 30 °C environment before being spotted on SDG/−U medium (without any chemical stress factors) for thermotolerance confirmation.;  The corresponding yeast spots growing on SDG/−U plates without heat stress were used as the control.;  Hsp20s have significant effects on the response to oxidative stress [38]. Here we also assessed the possible antioxidant abilities of seven CrHsp20s with a yeast spot assay.; The H2O2 oxidative stress tolerance confirmations in yeast mutant strains. (A) skn7Δ. (B) yap1∆. Yeast cultures were adjusted to OD600 = 2, and 2-μL of serial dilutions (10-fold, from left to right in each panel) were spotted on SDG/−U medium plates supplemented with different concentrations of H2O2 (0.2 mM, 0.3 mM, and 0.5 mM), and the corresponding yeast spots growing on SDG/−U plates without H2O2 were used as the control.; The overexpression of different Hsp20s in plants or microorganisms has been demonstrated by multiple studies to elevate stress tolerance [7]. Here we also amplified several CrHsp20s from the total cDNAs of the C. rosea plants and performed heterologous overexpression with a yeast system—a simple and rapid method for the exploration of the putative functions of genes in vivo.;  For instance, the carrot Hsp17.7 gene could increase the growth rates and protein solubility in transgenic yeast under heat, cold, acid, and osmotic stress conditions [51]. Three Camellia sinensis small Hsp genes, CsHSP17.7, CsHSP18.1, and CsHSP21.8, also increased the tolerance of Pichia pastoris to heat and cold through heterologous expression in yeast [52]. Similarly, the overexpression of an Hsp (ThHSP18.3) from Tamarix hispida also conferred salt, alkaline, high osmotic stress, heavy metal, and heat or cold stress tolerance in yeast [53]. These CrHsp20s may act as molecular chaperones to protect yeast against heat stress damage by stabilizing proteins and membranes from degeneration, thereby maintaining regular yeast growth.;  Although some reports indicated that plant Hsp20s may also reduce the toxic effects of abiotic stresses by scavenging cellular ROS indirectly [24,38,47], and RcHSP17.8 in rose could enhance yeast H2O2 tolerance after overexpression, in our study we found that none of these seven CrHsp20s could elevate the H2O2 tolerance in either the skn7Δ or yap1Δ yeast mutant strains (Figure 10).;  This is quite different from other antioxidant molecular chaperones, such as late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) and abscisic acid-, stress-, and ripening-induced (ASR) proteins [54], or metallothioneins (MTs) [39]. Yap1 or Skn7 are two major transcription factors responsive to ROS in yeast, and functional deletion for either of these two regulators in yeast would cause hypersensitivity to H2O2 [55]. Such differences could be partially interpreted by the fact that H2O2 toxicity can be directly relaxed by some reductive protein molecules, such as MTs and LEAs/ASRs, while Hsp20s, being molecular chaperones, are mainly in charge of preventing the target proteins or structures from stress-induced aggregation or denaturation, thereby maintaining or recovering cellular homeostasis.;  The yeast expression vector CrHsp20s-pYES2 was constructed with the in-fusion technique (BD In-Fusion PCR cloning Kit, Takara Bio USA, Mountain View, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.;  In short, the PCR fragments were inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pYES2 and, after sequencing confirmation, these recombinant expression vectors were transformed into different yeast strains to verify the stress tolerance functions.;  The wild-type (WT) yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strain BY4741 (Y00000, MATa; ura3Δ0; leu2Δ0; his3Δ1; met15Δ0) and the two H2O2-sensitive mutant strains yap1Δ (Y00569, BY4741; MATa; ura3Δ0; leu2Δ0; his3Δ1; met15Δ0; YML007w::kanMX4), and skn7Δ (Y02900, BY4741; MATa; ura3Δ0; leu2Δ0; his3Δ1; met15Δ0; YHR206w::kanMX4) were obtained from Euroscarf (Frankfurt, Germany).;  The various yeast strains were transformed using the LiOAc/PEG method, and uracil complementation was used for selection.;  A synthetic defined (SD) yeast medium without uracil (SD-Ura) containing 2% (w/v) galactose (Gal) was used as the yeast induction medium (SDG-Ura) during the heat-stress tolerance and oxidative stress experiments on solid medium for the localization observations.;  In brief, the single colonies of yeast transformants were selected and used to inoculate liquid SDG-Ura medium and cultured overnight or longer at 30 °C in a shaker (150–200 rpm), diluted with fresh pre-warmed SDG medium (volume ratio 1:10), and then incubated with continuous shaking for about 30 h at 30 °C to reach an optical density of 1 at OD600 (optical density at 600 nm).;  For the thermotolerance test, the yeast cultures were incubated at 52 °C for 15 min (skn7Δ and WT) before gradient dilution and spotting on SDG plates.;  Several CrHsp20s were cloned and functionally confirmed in yeast for their possible roles in thermotolerance."
C. rosea,3825,35052375,8774410," In the present study, a genome-wide comprehensive analysis was conducted and finally eight CrNHXs were identified in C. rosea genome.;  Six CrNHXs showed high expression levels in five tested tissues of C. rosea in different levels, while CrNHX1 and CrNHX3 were expressed at extremely low levels, indicating that CrNHXs might be involved in regulating the development of C. rosea plant.;  The expression analysis based on RNA-seq showed that the transcripts of most CrNHXs were obviously decreased in mature leaves of C. rosea plant growing on tropical coral reefs, which suggested their involvement in this species’ adaptation to reefs and specialized islands habitats.;  This study provides comprehensive bio-information and primary functional identification of NHXs in C. rosea, which could help improve the salt/alkaline tolerance of genetically modified plants for further studies.;  This research also contributes to our understanding of the possible molecular mechanism whereby NHXs maintain the ion balance in the natural ecological adaptability of C. rosea to tropical coral islands and reefs.;  Halophytes can thrive under high salinity by adopting special strategies to improve salt tolerance or enhance salt avoidance [38]. Canavalia rosea is a halophyte species and widely distributes in tropical and subtropical coastal regions or islands [39]. As we have sequenced the whole genome of C. rosea, a functional study of its gene/protein family could provide a reference for researching the conservation biology of plant species in specialized habitats.; In this study, we performed a genome-wide characterization of NHX genes in C. rosea, to explore the potential roles of these family members in the adaptation of C. rosea to tropical coastal regions or coral reefs.;  The different tissues from young seedlings (root and stem) or adult plants (leaf, flower bud, and young fruit) of C. rosea were gathered for further transcription analysis of gene expression.;  The seeds of C. rosea were gathered from the coastal regions of Hainan province, China and then cultivated under normal conditions in a growth chamber.;  For habitat-specific expression pattern analyses of CrNHX members, mature leaf samples were captured from C. rosea adult plants growing in SCBG (transplanted from Hainan province since 2012) and Yongxing (YX) Island (16°83′93′′ N, 112°34′00′′ E).; Whole-genome sequencing was performed with C. rosea plants growing in SCBG, Guangzhou city, China.;  The assembled genome data of C. rosea were annotated with different programs, including InterPro [40] and Pfam [41] for gene identification, and DIAMOND [42] and InterProScan [40] were used to acquire the information of all proteins with conserved domains and motifs (e < 1 × 10−5).;  After that, a Pfam ID (Na_H_Exchanger, PF00999) search was performed in the C. rosea protein annotation database, and putative sequences of CrNHX proteins were further identified with the AtNHXs sequence alignment to eliminate the cation/H+ exchanger (CHX) and K+ efflux antiporter (KEA).;  Finally, the candidate CrNHXs were named based on their sequence homology after AtNHXs or other plant species NHXs and the C. rosea genome annotation.;  The obtained NHX nucleotide and protein sequences from C. rosea are listed in Table S1.;  Then, the protein sequences of eight AtNHXs from A.
thaliana [26], five OsNHXs from O. sativa [22], six VvNHXs from V. vinifera [28], nine GmNHXs from G. max [31], six MtNHXs from M. truncatula [26], seven MaNHXs from Morus atropurpurea [23], and eight CrNHXs from C. rosea were used to construct a neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree using Clustal W and MEGA 6 softwares (https://www.megasoftware.net/, accessed on 1 October 2021) with 1000 bootstrap replicates.; The CrNHX genomic DNA and cDNA sequences were extracted from the C. rosea genome database.; The promoter regions (2000 bp upstream from the translation start site) of all CrNHXs were retrieved from the genome database of C. rosea.; The C. rosea RNA-seq datasets were constructed using Illumina HiSeq X sequencing technology, by commissioning a commercial biotechnology company (Oebiotech, Shanghai, China).;  First, seven different tissues from C. rosea plants (root, stem, young leaf, flower bud, and young silique samples collected from C. rosea plants growing in SCBG; mature leaf samples from C. rosea growing in SCBG and on YX Island) were used for isolating the total RNA.;  The libraries were randomly sequenced, and the data were examined using FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/, accessed on 1 October 2021) based on the primary 5.65–7.16 Gb clean reads each sample and were mapped to the C. rosea reference genome using Tophat v.2.0.10 (http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/, accessed on 1 October 2021).;  Second, the C. rosea seedling tissues under different abiotic stress challenges mentioned above (including 600 mM NaCl, 150 mM NaHCO3 (pH 8.2), 300 mM mannitol solutions, and 45 °C pre-warmed half-strength Hoagland’s solution) were also sequenced at the transcriptome level, with the same above RNA isolation, library construction, cDNA sequencing, and gene read alignment procedures.;  All of the EST information was mapped to the C. rosea reference genome.; The total RNA was extracted from different C. rosea tissues using the Quick RNA isolation Kit (Huayueyong, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s specifications.; The full-length cDNA sequences of the CrNHX genes were obtained from the genome database of C. rosea (listed in Supplementary materials, Table S1).;  Then, the open reading frames (ORFs) of the CrNHX genes were PCR amplified from different cDNA samples of C. rosea with gene-specific primer pairs (listed in Table S2).; A total of eight CrNHX genes were identified from the C. rosea genome through sequence similarity searches and the conserved Na_H_Exchanger domain identification (Table S1).;  The chromosomal map of the CrNHX family showed that only five chromosomes of C. rosea held the CrNHX genes, and most genes were on chromosome 1 (three genes), followed by chromosome 4 with two genes.; (A) Locations of the 8 CrNHXs on 11 chromosomes of C. rosea. (B) Subgroup classification of CrNHXs (left) and their gene exon–intron structures (right).; Nomenclature and subcellular localization of CrNHXs identified from C. rosea genome.; Phylogenetic relationships of the eight CrNHXs from C. rosea, eight AtNHXs from A. thaliana, five OsNHXs from O. sativa, six VvNHXs from V. vinifera, nine GmNHXs from G. max, six MedtrNHXs from M. truncatula, and seven MaNHXs from M. atropurpurea.; To gain further insights into the putative biological function of CrNHX genes in C. rosea, cis-regulatory elements located in the promoter (ATG upstream 2000 bp) of each CrNHX gene were investigated.;  The cis-regulatory element analysis data suggested that CrNHX genes might respond to multiple hormones and abiotic stresses, thus playing a role in high salinity/alkaline stress adaptation in C. rosea.;  Five tissues, including the root, stem, young leaf, flowering bud, and young fruit collected from adult C. rosea plants growing in SCBG, were selected for this study.; (A) Heatmaps showing the expression levels of the eight CrNHXs in the root, stem, leaf, flower bud, and young fruit of C. rosea plants.; The expression profiles of the C. rosea NHX genes were also analyzed in mature leaves collected from adult plants growing in different habitats (SCBG and YX Island) to explore the possible roles that CrNHXs play in the response of C. rosea plants to specialized habitats with high salinity/alkaline features.;  These results suggest that, under the extreme circumstances on the tropical coral reef, the expression of CrNHXs in C. rosea leaves was most likely suppressed to some degree, implying the decreased transporting of salt ions in the aerial part of this halophyte to alleviate the toxic effects of high salinity/alkaline.; The expression differences of the eight CrNHXs in mature C. rosea leaves planted in the South China Botanical Garden (SCBG) and in Yongxing (YX) Island.; To further verify that CrNHXs are involved in the specific responses of C. rosea plants to different stresses, we analyzed the transcriptional expression of CrNHXs under high salinity/alkaline, high osmotic stress, and heat treatment, to mimic each single stress factor in the specialized habitat of the tropical coral reef as closely as possible.;  In general, the expression of CrNHXs in the C. rosea seedlings showed more obvious transcriptional changes under high salinity stress than under alkaline or high osmosis stresses, which might be closely related to their biochemical functions being ion channels.;  In contrast, high salt stress for 2 h caused the decreased expression of CrNHX5 (by −39.24%) and CrNHX7 (by –32.48%) in the leaf samples, as well as the high alkaline challenge (by −43.02% and −40.13%, respectively); the high osmotic stress also obviously decreased the expression of CrNHX5 (by −43.30%) in C. rosea leaf at the 2 h time point (Figure 7B).;  High temperatures are often the norm on tropical coral reefs and affect the growth of C. rosea.;  Yellow denotes high expression levels, and dark-blue denotes low expression levels. (B) The FPKM histogram of the RNA-seq data for the expression patterns of eight CrNHXs in the root and leaf samples captured from the heat-shock-treated C. rosea seedlings.; We further confirmed the expression of the CrNHXs under high salinity, alkaline, and high osmosis challenges by qRT-PCR in C. rosea seedlings (Figure 9).;  In conclusion, our results suggested that this CrNHX family presented different expression patterns in response to abiotic stresses, which are representative conditions of the ecological environments on tropical coral reefs, indicating the specificity of CrNHXs in different physiological processes or tissue types or the involvement of CrNHXs in the ecological adaptation of C. rosea plants to high salinity/alkali and extreme drought.; Quantitative RT-PCR detection of the expression levels of the eight CrNHXs responding to different stresses (600 mM NaCl, 150 mM NaHCO3, and 300 mM mannitol) in C. rosea seedlings of (A) root samples under 2 h stress challenges; (B) leaf samples under 2 h stress challenges; (C) root samples under 48 h stress challenges; and (D) leaf samples under 48 h stress challenges.;  Thus, the different classes of NHXs work to maintain cellular salinity tolerance and K+ homeostasis [52]. In this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis of CrNHXs in the C. rosea genome and obtained genomic and transcriptional information concerning the possible roles of this family in adaptation to specialized habitats on tropical coral reefs and islands.;  In this study, eight CrNHX genes were comprehensively investigated for the first time based on the C. rosea genome data, and the expression profiles of these CrNHXs were analyzed to explore their functions in the abiotic stress response in different C. rosea tissues.;  Compared with the number of NHXs in other species, the number in C. rosea is similar to that in Arabidopsis and other leguminous plants.;  Our previous genome sequencing for C. rosea indicates that this species is a typical diploid (data not published).;  In this study, we mainly focused on some hormone-responsive and abiotic stress-related elements that have been confirmed in other plant species, and we propose that these elements hold some function similarities in C. rosea.;  The habitat-specific RNA-seq data further indicated that most of the CrNHXs had lower expression levels in the leaf samples of C. rosea plants growing in coastal C. rosea (YX) than in inland C. rosea (SCBG; Figure 6), which suggests that the high salinity/alkaline and environmental extremes probably severely limited the expression levels and subsequent Na+/K+ transport activities in the aerial parts of C. rosea.;  The differential expression of CrNHXs might be associated with Na+ and K+/H+ absorption and transport in different habitats, and the lower expression level of CrNHXs in coastal C. rosea plants might be an adaptive mechanism to deal with intracellular and extracellular high salinity/alkaline stress, while the transcriptional characteristics of CrNHXs in YX-native C. rosea plant roots are unclear and need further clarification.;  This may be because this protein family fulfills an important function in Na+/K+ and H+ transportation across cellular membranes, which is closely related to the salinity/alkaline tolerance of C. rosea, thereby regulating its environmental adaptation to tropical coastal regions.; Although plenty of previous reports have confirmed that overexpressing NHXs in plants could result in the elevated salt tolerance of the whole plant, probably by maintaining the balance of Na+/K+ and controlling saline ions and pH homeostasis in cytoplasm [33,34,37,48,53,54,55,56], the expression of CrNHXs in C. rosea was not always induced by the high salinity/alkaline challenges.;  It probably boiled down to the regulatory complexity of maintaining the saline ions homeostasis in different tissues, due to C. rosea being a multicellular organism.; In brief, we carried out a detailed analysis of the complete NHX gene family in specialized habitat halophyte species, C. rosea.;  The authors also extend their appreciation to the anonymous workers who provided us with Canavalia rosea plants in the South China Botanical Garden (Guangzhou city, China) and C. rosea seeds gathered from Hainan province, China.;  Figure S3: The FPKM values histogram of RNA-seq data for C. rosea plants.

Canavalia rosea,3825,35052375,8774410,"Canavalia rosea, distributed in the coastal areas of tropical and subtropical regions, is an extremophile halophyte with good adaptability to high salinity/alkaline and drought tolerance.;  Halophytes can thrive under high salinity by adopting special strategies to improve salt tolerance or enhance salt avoidance [38]. Canavalia rosea is a halophyte species and widely distributes in tropical and subtropical coastal regions or islands [39]. As we have sequenced the whole genome of C. rosea, a functional study of its gene/protein family could provide a reference for researching the conservation biology of plant species in specialized habitats.; Canavalia rosea plants growing in the South China Botanical Garden (SCBG, 23°18′76′′ N, 113°37′02′′ E) were used in this study.;  Canavalia rosea is a typical salt and drought-tolerant sea-drifting plant that is significant for ecological reconstruction on tropical reefs and islands.;  The authors also extend their appreciation to the anonymous workers who provided us with Canavalia rosea plants in the South China Botanical Garden (Guangzhou city, China) and C. rosea seeds gathered from Hainan province, China."
yeast,4932,35052375,8774410," Moreover, the yeast functional complementation test proved that some CrNHXs could partially restore the salt tolerance of the salt-sensitive yeast mutant AXT3.;  We further performed functional analysis of several CrNHXs via yeast functional complementation.;  The yeast wild-type (WT) strain W303 (MATα ura3-1 leu2-3112 his3-11,15 trp1-1 ade2-1 can1-100) and triple mutant strain AXT3 (Δena1::HIS3::ena4, Δnha1::LEU2, Δnhx1::KanMX4) were obtained from Zhou et al. [45]. The plasmids were introduced into yeast using the LiAc/PEG method [46]. Yeast growth and metal sensitivity tests were performed as described previously with minor modifications [47]. Briefly, transformed yeasts were grown on solid SDG-Ura medium (Synthetic Dropout medium plus 2% Galactose, Uracil deficiency) plates for two days, and single colonies of the yeast transformants were picked out and inoculated in liquid SDG-Ura medium overnight or longer at 30 °C, diluted with fresh pre-warmed SDG medium (volume ratio 1:10), and then incubated with vigorous shaking for about two days at 30 °C to reach an optical density of just 1 at OD600 (optical density at 600 nm).;  The coding sequences of these five CrNHXs were separately inserted into the yeast expression vector pYES2 under the control of the GAL1 promoter.;  Each vector (recombinant vectors and control pYES2) was introduced into the yeast triple mutant strain AXT3, which lacks the functions of four plasma membrane Na+-ATPases (ScENA1-4), the plasma membrane Na+, K+/H+ antiporter ScNHA1, and the vacuolar Na+, K+/H+ exchanger ScNHX1.;  Our findings also demonstrate that the CrNHX members showed different functional specificities for salt tolerance in yeast cells, though their biological functions in plants need to be further explored.; Complementation of yeast mutants on solid medium containing different concentrations of stress factors.;  The yeast wild-type strain W303 was transformed with the empty vector pYES2, and the triple-mutant strain AXT3 was transformed with the empty vector pYES2 or with the vectors carrying the CrNHX genes.;  Given that, we cloned the CrNHX genes and performed the further functional confirmation in the unicellular yeast system.; Over-expression in yeast systems is widely used to study the function of genes under biotic stresses.;  In this study, CrNHX1, CrNHX3, CrNHX5, CrNHX6, and CrNHX7 were cloned and expressed in the salt-sensitive yeast mutant strain AXT3.;  According to previous reports, hygromycin B sensitivity is a common phenotype of the yeast nhx1 mutant [12], and some identified plant NHX proteins have been confirmed being transporters for hygromycin B, as well as the Na+, K+, or Li+ transporters [48]. This further confirmed that CrNHXs transport Na+/K+ and hygromycin B in vivo, while their exact functions or mechanisms in salinity tolerance need to be further confirmed in transgenic plants.;  Further detailed analysis of expression profiles for CrNHXs performed using RNA-seq data, as well as using the heterologous expression assays with the yeast system to investigate the transporting activities of several CrNHXs, proved that this family is involved in salt/alkaline stress responses and plays vital roles in ecological adaptability for natural extreme adversity on tropical coral islands and reefs."
C. rosea,3825,33925342,8123667," In this study, we reported the first comprehensive survey of the LEA and ASR gene superfamily in C. rosea.;  A total of 84 CrLEAs and three CrASRs were identified in C. rosea and classified into nine groups.;  Our results revealed that the CrLEA genes were widely distributed in different chromosomes, and all of the CrLEA/CrASR genes showed wide expression features in different tissues in C. rosea plants.;  In addition to the edible and medicinal characteristics of the mature bean [39], C. rosea also demonstrates excellent growth potential under saline-alkali and high-temperature arid coral reef environments, with great advantages in saline-alkali tolerance and drought resistance [40]. Therefore, as a typical symbiotic nitrogen-fixing legume, C. rosea constitutes a superior wild plant resource and plays important roles in the island greening, sand fixation, and revegetation on tropical and subtropical coral islands and coastal zones.;  There is no doubt that C. rosea has developed elaborate mechanisms to adapt to the high sanity/alkaline drought stress caused by saltwater intrusion or freshwater deficit in sand dunes or coral reefs, and thus the identification of stress-relevant genes in this species is quite necessary.;  In the present study, based on the genome sequence of C. rosea, we explored the number of LEA/ASR proteins and their families as well as their structural characterization, gene chromosomal location, and tissue- or habitat- specific expression patterns in C. rosea.;  The availability of a whole-genome sequence of C. rosea will facilitate genome-wide analysis for identifying the evolutionary relationships of C. rosea LEAs/ASRs with related leguminous species.;  Additionally, the genome provides a source for mining the genetic resources, including LEA/ASR genes, of C. rosea plants, which have evolved to survive under extreme stress.; Based on the Hidden Markov model profile search and protein Blast research results, a total of 84 CrLEA and three CrASR members were identified and annotated from the C. rosea genome database.;  The predicted CrLEAs and CrASRs were named according to their subfamilies and the C. rosea gene nomenclature system (Table 1).; To systematically classify the C. rosea LEA and ASR genes and uncover the evolutionary relationships among this diverse gene family, an unrooted phylogenetic tree of 84 CrLEA and three CrASR members was constructed with MEGA6 using neighbor-joining analysis based on the sequences of the CrLEA and CrASR proteins (Figure 1).;  The unrooted tree was generated by ClustalW in MEGA6 with the sequences of the 87 C. rosea LEA and ASR proteins.; Exon–intron structures of CrLEA/CrASR genes and conserved motifs in CrLEA/CrASR proteins. (A) The lengths and positions of introns and exons were shown with black lines and thick green arrows for total of CrLEA/CrASR genes ordered by their names. (B) Conserved motifs of C. rosea CrLEA/CrASR proteins in the same subfamily, and these motifs were identified using Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME) and boxes with different colors represent different motifs. (C) Predications of CrLEA/CrASR proteins by the Pfam database (http://pfam.xfam.org/, accessed on 1 March 2021).; Chromosomal distribution of CrLEA/CrASR genes in C. rosea.;  The results showed that 19 pairs of segmentally duplicated genes and seven pairs of tandem duplicated genes were identified in 84 C. rosea LEA genes (Table 2), and one tandem duplication gene cluster was found on the end of the 11th chromosome (CrLEA2-58/CrLEA2-59/CrLEA2-60) (Figure 3).;  The distribution of segmentally duplicated CrLEA genes in the C. rosea chromosomes is simply illustrated in Figure 4.; Segmental duplication of CrLEA/CrASR genes in C. rosea genome.;  To further understand the potential functions and regulatory mechanisms of CrLEAs and CrASRs, especially for exploring the possible roles of this gene family for the adaptation of C. rosea to high salinity and drought, we analyzed the promoter regions of the upstream 1000 bp of 87 putative CrLEAs and CrASRs, which are believed to play important roles in regulating the spatial and temporal expression of genes.; Heatmaps showing (A) the expression levels of the 87 CrLEA/CrASR genes in the root, vine, leaf, flower bud, and young fruit of C. rosea plant and (B) expression differences of the 87 CrLEA/CrASR genes in mature C. rosea leaves planting in South China Botanical Garden (SCBG) and in Yongxing Island (YX).; Based on reports on the different LEA numbers involved in abiotic stresses [8,11,20,41,42,43,44,45], with reference to the RNA-Seq results and the promoter region analysis, we further identified 10 genes (including three CrASRs, five CrDHNs, and two CrLEA_4s) for expression analysis in different C. rosea tissues.;  CrASR1 showed obviously elevated expression in the C. rosea roots under mannitol or ABA challenges, while CrASR3 showed marked expression induction in the C. rosea leaves or vines in response to high salt or ABA treatments.;  Distinctively, CrLEA4-1 and CrLEA4-2 were significantly induced in all C. rosea tissues with the mannitol stress and ABA treatment, and the transcripts of CrLEA4-2 showed a significant increase in the roots of C. rosea under high salt treatment (Figure 7A).;  Regarding the five dehydrin genes in C. rosea, all of the CrDHNs, without exception, had strong responses to mannitol and showed extremely significant expression induction in the root tissues of the C. rosea plants, while their expression patterns in response to the other three treatments (including high salinity, alkaline, and ABA) showed different degrees of induction or suppression (Figure 7B).;  Based on the above analysis, the results of the qRT-PCR are basically consistent with the results of the RNA-Seq analysis pertaining to the different habitats, and we propose that these genes may play important roles in the response of C. rosea to abiotic stress and adaptation to the extreme environment in the coral reef.; Quantitative RT-PCR detection of the expression levels of the 10 CrLEA/CrASR genes responding to different stresses (600 mM NaCl, 150 mM NaHCO3, 300 mM mannitol, or 100 mM ABA) in C. rosea seedling plants. (A) 3 CrASRs and 2 CrLEA_4s. (B) 5 CrDHNs.; Combined with our transcriptional analyses and promoter regions’ prediction, we could conclude preliminarily that these 10 CrLEAs and CrASRs (three CrASRs, five CrDHNs, and two CrLEA_4s) are closely related with the adaptation to abiotic stresses in C. rosea, especially to high salinity, alkaline, or water deficit, etc.;  As we can see from Figure 8A, with the exception of CrASR1, the rest of the nine C. rosea genes all showed varying degrees of increased tolerance to H2O2.; Due to the significant roles of LEA and ASR proteins in water deficit stress responses and ROS scavenging abilities, they are believed to act in multiple developmental processes and in response to various stresses, as indicated in a number of previous reports [1,2,3,9]. As C. rosea is a halophyte with the typical features of high salt/alkaline and drought tolerance, it is necessary to systematically investigate the potential role of LEA/ASRs, especially given the lack of studies on LEA/ASR genes in legumes (Fabaceae).;  As C. rosea generally occurs in tropical and subtropical coastal regions, water shortages are one of the main impacts of its environmental surroundings.;  It is believed that C. rosea has developed a series of sophisticated mechanisms at multiple levels to cope with stress, including morphological, physiological, and genetic changes and adaptations, ultimately regulating the expression of stress-responsive genes through complex networks.;  In the present study, we conducted whole-genome scanning in C. rosea, and a total of 84 CrLEAs and three CrASRs were identified (Table 1).;  The number of LEA or ASR genes in C. rosea was compared with other plant species [11,20], and the number of different subfamilies of LEA/ASR genes from other legume species was summarized (Table S5).;  LEA_2 is considered as an atypical LEA protein because it possesses more hydrophobic amino acids and a more defined secondary structure compared with other LEA subfamily members [20]. Additionally, also we found that this subfamily contained the only tandem duplicate cluster in C. rosea (Table 2), indicating that tandem duplications have contributed significantly to the expansion and diversification of the large LEA_2 family in C. rosea.;  The other segmental duplications occurring in CrLEA_1, CrLEA_3, CrLEA_4, and CrLEA_5 indicated that these LEA genes might participate in the adaptive evolution of C. rosea to water shortage stresses by increasing their gene numbers.;  The contribution of single CrLEA or CrASR genes to the stress tolerance and environmental adaptation of C. rosea needs to be further explored. ; An investigation of the natural habitat of C. rosea indicates that this species possesses significant growth potential and is an adaptable pioneer species that can be used for island greening, sand fixation, and the ecological restoration of coral islands and coastal zones in tropical or subtropical regions [40]. We firstly examined the expression of the CrLEA and CrASR genes in the different tissues and developmental periods using RNA-Seq.;  Our further habitat-specific RNA-Seq data indicated that most of the CrLEA/CrASR genes had greater expression levels in coastal C. rosea (YX) than in inland C. rosea (SCBG), while some were quite the opposite (Figure 6B).;  Our results suggested that the differential expression of CrLEA/CrASR genes might be an adaptive mechanism for dealing with intracellular and extracellular water-deficit signals in C. rosea plants, which is associated with different water loss strategies in different habitats and, in the longer term, may also function in the biological adaptability to changes in environmental factors and different habitats.; We also used qRT-PCR to investigate the expression patterns of 10 candidate genes in C. rosea plants under salt, alkaline, high osmotic treatment, and ABA stresses.;  This result is consistent with several previous reports of LEA genes in other plant species, in which their expression was also greatly affected by abiotic stress challenges and hormone treatments [19,48,50]. The relevant roles of ASRs, DHNs, or the LEA_4s subfamily genes during plant stress tolerance have been reported in earlier studies using various techniques [11,20,42]. Here both the RNA-Seq and the qRT-PCR results indicated that these genes might be vital factors influencing the adaptability of C. rosea plants to salt/alkaline and drought stresses in tropical or subtropical coastal regions.;  Here, we identified and characterized 10 CrLEA/CrASR genes in C. rosea for the first time and performed functional verification in yeast to investigate bioactivities for abiotic stress resistance.;  This indicated that CrASR1 could act as a transcriptional regulator together with chaperone-like proteins or hydrophilins, like other LEA/ASR proteins [11,34]. Previous studies have proved that tomato ASR1 is a drought stress-responsive transcription factor, and its consensus ASR1-binding motif was enriched in some specific tomato genomic loci, possibly containing several aquaporin genes [12,52]. A recent study on CaASR1 in another Solanaceae species, Capsicum annuum, also provided evidence that CaASR1 could interact with the transcription factor CabZIP63 and is a positive regulator of the defense response of pepper to the pathogen R. solanacearum, probably by acting as a transcription activator [53]. Our results strongly suggest that CrASR1 showed quite different features from the other two CrASRs or CrLEAs (Figure 8 and Figure 9), and this protein might fulfill an important function in salt/drought tolerance and regulate the environmental adaptation of C. rosea to tropical coastal regions, although more research is needed for further clarification.; C. rosea plants growing in Yongxing Island (YX, 16°83′93′′ N, 112°34′00′′ E) and South China Botanical Garden (SCBG, 23°18′76′′ N, 113°37′02′′ E) were used in this study.;  To analyze the tissue-specific transcriptional patterns of the CrLEA and CrASR genes, the roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits were sampled from C. rosea plants grown in SCBG.;  To investigate the involvement of the CrLEA and CrASR genes in the adaptation to a high-temperature island climate, coastal saline environment, and seasonal drought environment, adult plant leaves were also gathered from C. rosea growing on both YX Island and SCBG. ;  Seedlings of C. rosea germinated from seeds in a soil/vermiculite mixture for 30 d were subjected to treatments.;  In brief, for high salinity stress, the C. rosea seedlings were removed from the pots and carefully washed with distilled water to remove soil from the roots, following which they were transferred into 600 mM NaCl solution; for salt-alkaline stress, the cleaned C. rosea seedlings were soaked in a 150 mM NaHCO3 (pH 8.2) solution; for the drought treatment, the seedlings were soaked in a 300 mM mannitol solution; and for abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, a freshly prepared working solution of 100 μM exogenous ABA was sprayed onto the leaves of the C. rosea seedlings.; The putative CrLEA and CrASR gene sequences were collected from the genome database of C. rosea.;  All of the C. rosea proteins were first identified using DIAMOND [54] and InterProscan (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/search/sequence/, accessed on 1 March 2021) to assess the conserved domains and motifs (e < 1 × 10−5), following which they were annotated using the Pfam database (http://pfam.xfam.org/, accessed on 1 March 2021).;  Finally, the selected CrLEAs and CrASRs were named based on their sequence homology with other known plant LEAs or ASRs and the C. rosea genome annotations.;  An unrooted neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was created based on multiple protein sequence alignments of all identified CrLEAs and CrASRs from C. rosea using Clustal X 2.0 and MEGA 6 with 1000 bootstrap replicates.;  The obtained LEA and ASR nucleotide and protein sequences from C. rosea are listed in Table S1.; The CrLEA and CrASR genes were mapped onto C. rosea chromosomes according to the positional information of these genes in the C. rosea genome database and were displayed using MapInspect software (http://mapinspect.apponic.com/, accessed on 1 March 2021).; The promoter regions (1000 bp upstream from the translation start site) of all CrLEA and CrASR genes were retrieved from the genome database of C. rosea for further analysis of the cis-regulatory elements and motifs by querying them through the PlantCARE database (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/, accessed on 1 March 2021).; The C. rosea RNA-Seq datasets were constructed using Illumina HiSeq X sequencing technology.;  In brief, seven different tissues from C. rosea plants (root, vine, young leaf, flower bud, and young silique samples collected from C. rosea plants growing in SCBG; mature leaf samples from C. rosea growing in SCBG and on YX Island) were examined using FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/, accessed on 1 March 2021) based on the primary 40 Gb clean reads and were mapped to the C. rosea reference genome using Tophat v2.0.10 (http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/, accessed on 1 March 2021).;  Total RNA was extracted from the C. rosea seedling roots, vines, and leaves under the stress/ABA treatment and unstressed treatment using an RNA plant extraction kit (Magen, Biotech, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and approximately 1 μg of purified total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA in a 20 μL reaction volume using AMV reverse transcriptase (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) according to the supplier’s instructions.;  In brief, total RNA was extracted from C. rosea seedling tissues under the stress/ABA treatments and reverse transcribed into cDNA.;  The full-length CrLEA/ASR cDNA was PCR-amplified from C. rosea leaf cDNA using the gene specific primers listed in Supplementary Materials Table S1.;  In brief, the full CDSs of CrASRs were amplified from C. rosea leaves cDNA using the corresponding primers as listed in Supplementary Materials Table S1.; In summary, this study is the first to systematically summarize members of the LEA and ASR gene family in a leguminous halophyte, C. rosea.;  In total, 84 CrLEA genes and three CrASR genes were identified in the C. rosea genome and were classified into nine subgroups.;  Chromosomal mapping and synteny analysis revealed that these members are distributed in all 11 chromosomes of C. rosea, with several gene tandem and segmental duplication patterns for LEA gene expansion in the C. rosea genome.;  The CrLEA/CrASR superfamily was involved in the adaptation of C. rosea to different habitats, and 10 of the CrLEA/CrASR members showed obvious differences in gene expression in response to salt/alkaline stress, high osmotic stress, or ABA treatment.;  This systematic study provides new information on the LEA/ASR superfamily in C. rosea and further expands our understanding of the association of CrLEA/CrASR genes with natural ecological adaptability and abiotic stress responses in C. rosea.;

yeast,4932,33925342,8123667," Additionally, we introduced 10 genes from different groups into yeast to assess the functions of the CrLEAs/CrASRs.;  To identify their potential roles in vivo, we performed a series of heterogeneous expression assays of the above 10 genes in a yeast system for functional stress tolerance investigation.;  For the antioxidation tolerance test, 10 CrLEAs and CrASRs were introduced into two H2O2-sensitive mutant strains yap1Δ and skn7Δ, with the corresponding wild-type (WT) yeast BY4741 and two mutant strains transformed with the empty vector pYES2 as controls.;  Due to the highly hydrophilic features and putative antioxidative abilities of CrLEAs and CrASRs, we also tested several other abiotic stress tolerances in the yeast WT strain (Figure 8B, upper).;  In Figure 8B with respect to salt stress, the majority of the above 10 genes showed elevated salinity tolerance in yeast than empty vector pYES2, while the effects varied.;  The expression of all 10 genes elevated the alkaline stress tolerance of the yeast.;  We assessed the cadmium (Cd) tolerance of WT yeast expressing CrLEAs and CrASRs, mainly based on their antioxidative abilities (Figure 8A) as well as the speculations of some reports that ASR or dehydrin proteins possess the ability to bind metals due to their possession of His-rich motifs [33,46,47]. Our results indicated that at least three CrASRs and four CrDHNs (including CrDHN1, CrDHN2, CrDHN3, and CrDHN4) all presented a certain degree of enhanced Cd tolerance in yeast (Figure 8B, lower).;  Furthermore, most of the 10 CrLEAs and CrASRs could increase the high osmotic stress tolerance of yeast when expressed in the WT strain (Figure 8B, lower).;  Although these yeast stress tolerance results are preliminary, and a few members even showed no significant effects against some stress challenges, there is still need for further functional identification in plants using transgenic systems.; The tolerance confirmations of the 3 CrASRs, 5 CrDHNs, and 2 CrLEA_4s heteroexpression in yeast. (A) H2O2 oxidative stress tolerance confirmations in yeast. (B) Salt, alkaline, cadmium, and high osmotic tolerance confirmations in yeast.;  To further assess our speculation, the complete coding regions of all three CrASR cDNAs were ligated in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain of the pGBKT7 vector and transformed in yeast in this study, with the empty vector GAL4-BD (pGBKT7-BD) as the negative control.;  The yeast growth on the SD medium lacking tryptophan (SD/-Trp) was normal and even, while the growth on the SD medium lacking tryptophan and histidine (SD/-Trp/-His) was inhibited.;  Only the yeast cells containing GAL4-BD-CrASR1 exhibited normal growth, and the LacZ staining assay of β-galactosidase activity was positive (Figure 9B), which indicated that CrASR1 showed transcription activation activity and might be a transcription factor. ; CrASRs sequence alignment and GAL4 DNA binding domain-CrASRs fusion analyses for transactivation activity in yeast. (A) Sequence alignment of CrASR1, CrASR2, and CrASR3.;  The N-terminal His-rich motif, possible transcription activation domain, ABA/WDS domain, and C-terminal nuclear localization sequence were marked with black bold lines. (B) The GAL4 DNA binding domain was fused with 3 CrASRs and transformed into the yeast strain AH109 containing the His3 and LacZ reporter genes.;  Analysis of β-galactosidase activity of the relative yeast strains on plates.;  The yeast culture (OD600 to 2) was serially diluted to OD600 values of 0.2, 0.02 and 0.002, and then the 2-μL yeast liquid was spotted onto SD plates and cultured for 2 days at 30 °C.;  It exhibits excellent salt tolerance and drought resistance, and the induction of IpLEAs in yeast obviously improved the salt and oxidative stress tolerance of yeast clones [51]. Prior studies revealed that some LEA genes from Dendrobium officinale were able to enhance the cellular tolerance to high temperature and salt stresses of E. coli cells [49]. For ASR genes, our previous research also demonstrated that an I. pes-caprae ASR gene, IpASR, could improve salinity and drought tolerance in transgenic E. coli and Arabidopsis [45]. In summary, LEA and ASR genes are pertinent research subjects in plant stress physiology and are mainly involved in drought or salinity tolerance in plants.;  Here, we identified and characterized 10 CrLEA/CrASR genes in C. rosea for the first time and performed functional verification in yeast to investigate bioactivities for abiotic stress resistance.;  Based on our results, nine of the candidate genes increased the yeast cell resistance to H2O2, showing individual differences (Figure 8A).;  The majority of the 10 tested genes elevated the high salinity, alkaline, and high osmotic stress tolerance of yeast compared with the empty vector control, while some even showed heavy metal Cd tolerance, but not significantly so (Figure 8B).; Although CrASR1 did not present antioxidant properties in yeast, it is a highly hydrophilic protein with a relatively low GRAVY value score (Table 1).;  According to our previous reports [35,45], it is uncertain whether this type of ASR protein could activate transcription and act as a transcription factor, while our result on the transcriptional activation assay in yeast indicated that CrASR1 did exhibit transcription factor activity, yet CrASR2 and CrASR3 had exactly the opposite effect (Figure 9B).;  The construction of the yeast expression vector pYES2-CrLEAs/ASRs were constructed with in-fusion technique (BD In-Fusion PCR cloning Kit, Takara Bio USA, Mountain View, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.;  In short, the PCR fragments were inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pYES2 and after sequencing confirmation, these recombinant expression vectors were transformed into different yeast strains to verify the stress tolerance functions.;  The wild-type (WT) yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strain BY4741 (Y00000, MATa; ura3Δ0; leu2Δ0; his3Δ1; met15Δ0) and the two H2O2-sensitive mutant strains yap1Δ (Y00569, BY4741; MATa; ura3Δ0; leu2Δ0; his3Δ1; met15Δ0; YML007w::kanMX4) and skn7Δ (Y02900, BY4741; MATa; ura3Δ0; leu2Δ0; his3Δ1; met15Δ0; YHR206w::kanMX4) were obtained from Euroscarf (Frankfurt, Germany).;  The various yeast strains were transformed using the LiOAc/PEG technique, and uracil complementation was used for selection.;  A synthetic defined (SD) yeast medium without uracil (SD-Ura) containing 2% (w/v) galactose (Gal) was used as the yeast induction medium (SDG-Ura) during the salt/alkaline tolerance and oxidative stress experiments on solid medium for the localization observations.; The open reading frames (ORFs) of three CrASRs were cloned into the vector pGBKT7 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) for transcription activation analysis with the yeast two-hybrid assay according to the manufacturer’s introduction (Clontech, CA, USA).;  These constructs along with the negative control pGBKT7 (containing the binding domain, BD) were transformed into yeast strain AH109 using the LiOAc/PEG method.;  The yeast clones were cultured in liquid SD-Trp medium to an OD600 value of 2, after which they were diluted using a gradient dilution (1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000).;  Two-microliter yeast cultures were spotted onto the corresponding synthetically defined (SD/-Trp and SD/-Trp/-Leu) medium plates for 2 days at 30 °C.;  The primers used in construction of pGBKT7 vectors for CrASRs transactivation activity assay in yeast are listed in Supplementary Materials Table S1."
C. thermarum TA2.A1,986075,37577439,10416648," We also observed C. thermarum TA2.A1 expressing transporters for ectoine and glycine betaine, compounds that are known osmolytes that may assist in maintaining a near neutral internal pH when the external pH is highly alkaline.;  Specifically, we present an overview of the detected membrane proteome of C. thermarum TA2.A1, focusing particularly on its transporters and ETC.;  C. thermarum TA2.A1 membranes were solubilised in 200 μM ammonium-bicarbonate (ABC) buffer with either 2% (w/v) n-tetradecylphosphocholine (FOS-choline-12, Anatrace) or 0.01% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 30 min at 50°C, 65°C, or 80°C, while gently shaking at 300 rpm.;  The full genome of C. thermarum TA2.A1 (de Jong et al., 2020) contains 3,085 genes (NCBI; accession: {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""CP082237"",""term_id"":""2088805434"",""term_text"":""CP082237""}}CP082237), of which 1,244 (Figure 1A) were detected in this experiment (~40% of the genome).;  The C. thermarum TA2.A1 genome contains 754 proteins out of the total 3,085 that contain a single predicted TMH.;  However, caution should be taken with such a result because to confidently state that C. thermarum TA2.A1 expressed two terminal oxidases under the growth conditions we imposed, detecting the additional subunits provides greater clarity toward the notion of functionality.;  Finally, the ATP synthase was also detected, revealing that we can get very close to detecting a fully functional C. thermarum TA2.A1 pathway for oxidative phosphorylation from whole cell proteomics.;  The aerobic and most efficient ETC C. thermarum TA2.A1 consists of Ndh-1, Sdh, cytochrome complex b6c1, cytochrome c, and cytochrome oxidase aa3.;  The detection of Ndh-2 is in line with earlier research on this enzyme in C. thermarum TA2.A1, where it has been studied as a potential analog for drug targets (Heikal et al., 2014; Godoy-Hernandez et al., 2019; Godoy-Hernandez and McMillan, 2021).;  A simple shake flask batch was used, which could have led to some oxygen limitation at the end of the batch phase, forcing C. thermarum TA2.A1 to adopt a more austere lifestyle.;  The detection of possibly two sucrose importers means this research has failed to highlight the genes encoding for the sucrose:sodium symporter that originally sparked the interest in C. thermarum TA2.A1 (Peddie et al., 1999, 2000).;  In line with other alkaliphiles, no defined medium for C. thermarum TA2.A1 exists, and it still requires the presence of tryptic peptone extract to grow, which could contain a substrate for all of these transporters.;  C. thermarum TA2.A1 has two types of sodium:proton antiporters; a few subunits of the multisubunit Mrp were detected under the conditions used.;  C. thermarum TA2.A1 relies on the TrkAH system for potassium uptake.;  C. thermarum TA2.A1 is capable of growing up to 6% NaCl (Xue et al., 2006), perhaps in part due to its reliance on this potassium uptake system.;  The teichoic acid importer is displayed, being regarded as an important protein for alkaliphiles (Aono and Uramoto, 1986; Aono et al., 1995, 1999), even though previous tests showed teichoic acid presence in C. thermarum TA2.A1 (Kleikamp et al., 2020).;  Several drug exporters were also detected, further shedding light on the possible mechanisms C. thermarum TA2.A1 might use to remain dominant in a given environment.;  The incorporation of transporters of glycine betaine and ectoine could be another method used by C. thermarum TA2.A1 to combat the challenges posed by the high pH at which it lives.; This study is the first report on the proteome of C. thermarum TA2.A1, in which 1,398 proteins (45.3% of all potential proteins) were detected in at least one of the experiments.;  The total coverage of the membrane proteome is 20.9%. C. thermarum TA2.A1 is an alkaliphile, and therefore this study focuses primarily on proteins identified in the ETC and on transporters.;  The conditions under which C. thermarum TA2.A1 employs its alternative terminal oxidases are also yet to be revealed.; Here we report on a proteomic study where we investigated several sample preparation approaches to maximize the coverage for membrane proteins for C. thermarum TA2.A1.;  Finally, the expression of the glycine betaine and ectoine importers implies that C. thermarum TA2.A1 relies in part on osmolytes for its survival, something that has not been reported previously in the literature for this organism.;  In short, this research provides a valuable benchmark for further research into alkaliphiles and C. thermarum TA2.A1 in particular.; Violin plot showing an in silico digestion profile of the C. thermarum TA2.A1 membrane proteome using different digestion enzymes: Trypsin, LysC, chymotrypsin, and combining LysC with chymotrypsin."
Caldalkalibacillus thermarum TA2.A1,986075,37577439,10416648," The thermoalkaliphile Caldalkalibacillus thermarum TA2.A1 is an organism of interest for studies into how alkaliphiles adapt to their extreme lifestyles, as it can grow from pH 7.5 to pH 11.; In this study, we focus on a polyextremophile, the thermoalkaliphile Caldalkalibacillus thermarum TA2.A1.; Caldalkalibacillus thermarum TA2.A1 was grown in 5-L flat-bottomed shake flasks at 65°C with a working volume of 1 L rich medium, the composition of which was described previously (McMillan et al., 2009).;  Data were analyzed against the proteome database from C. thermarum [GenBank: {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""CP082237.1"",""term_id"":""2088805434"",""term_text"":""CP082237.1""}}CP082237.1, strain Caldalkalibacillus thermarum TA2.A1 complete genome, Tax ID: 559292 (de Jong et al., 2020)] using PEAKS Studio X (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc., Waterloo, Canada), allowing for 20 ppm parent ion and 0.02 m/z fragment ion mass error, three missed cleavages, carbamidomethylation and methionine oxidation, and N/Q deamidation as variable modifications."
Curvularia lonarensis,1912045,27920761,5118452," Taxonomic characterization (morphological and physiological) and multi locus sequence analysis (MLSA) using combined alignment of ITS-LSU-gpd of strain MEF018 showed that it is a novel species of the genus Curvularia and hence proposed as Curvularia lonarensis sp. nov.;  Finally, we did the taxonomical characterization of a novel species of alkaliphilic and halophilic Curvularia which showed efficient phenol oxidase production potential at alkaline pH and proposed it as Curvularia lonarensis sp. nov.; Curvularia lonarensis Rohit Sharma and Rahul Sharma sp. nov. (Figure ​(Figure44).; (A) Colony morphology of Curvularia lonarensis strain MEF018 on OA; (B–E) Morphology of conidia as captured by DIC imaging showing ornamentation on all cells of conidia (Scale bars: B–E = 10 μm); (F–K) Structural features of conidia and conidiophores of Curvularia lonarensis strain MEF018 as depicted during light microscopic imaging.

Curvularia pseudorobusta,554547,27920761,5118452," Curvularia sp. strain MEF018 showed highest phenol oxidase production at alkaline condition and had low sequence similarity with previously characterized species (96% with Curvularia pseudorobusta).;  We found that, in addition to efficient phenol oxidase production potential in extreme condition of alkalinity (pH- 12) and at high temperature (40°C) Curvularia sp. strain MEF018 showed low sequence similarity (96%) with previously isolated and characterized Curvularia pseudorobusta."
Curvularia sp.,1715225,27920761,5118452," Curvularia sp. strain MEF018 showed highest phenol oxidase production at alkaline condition and had low sequence similarity with previously characterized species (96% with Curvularia pseudorobusta).;  In-depth taxonomical characterization of Curvularia sp. strain MEF018 was conducted as discussed in Madrid et al. (2014).;  Based on their enzyme production potential at high salinity and pH, Fusarium sp. strain MEF008, Curvularia sp. strain MEF018, Cladorrhinum sp. strain MEF109, and Cladosporium sp. strain MEF135 were selected from the 14 fungal isolates (phenol oxidase producer) for further comparative study of fungal phenol oxidase (Figures S3, S4).;  Result of enzyme assay indicated that Curvularia sp. strain MEF018 produced high levels of phenol oxidase followed by Cladosporium sp. strain MEF135, while Fusarium sp. strain MEF008 and Cladorrhinum sp. strain MEF109 showed nearly five time less phenol oxidase production efficiency than above two strains (Figures S5, S6).;  In addition Curvularia sp. strain MEF018 showed optimum phenol oxidase production potential at high pH (pH 12) and at 40°C, which is good for ecological point of view and showed that these potential of strains could be exploited in extreme condition of alkalinity, salinity and temperature (Figures S5, S6).;  We found that, in addition to efficient phenol oxidase production potential in extreme condition of alkalinity (pH- 12) and at high temperature (40°C) Curvularia sp. strain MEF018 showed low sequence similarity (96%) with previously isolated and characterized Curvularia pseudorobusta.;  Manamgoda et al. (2012) reclassified several Bipolaris and Curvularia species based on phylogeny of ITS, LSU, gpd, tef sequences.;  The close clustering of 3 Curvularia species belonging to different habitat indicates that ecological gradient may not be a factor in differentiating these species, hence not correlated with fungal diversity.;  In conclusion, the above described novel fungus is an important finding of current study because till date no Curvularia species with phenol oxidase producing potential has been reported from hyper alkaline and saline habitats."
D. alkaliphilus,427926,37520367,10376724," The strains of D. alkaliphilus were previously isolated from geographically remote Mongolian and Kenyan soda lakes.;  Key catabolic processes sustaining the growth of both D. alkaliphilus strains appeared to fit the geochemical settings of two contrasting natural alkaline environments, sulfur-enriched soda lakes and iron-enriched serpentinites.;  Genome analysis revealed multiheme c-type cytochromes to be the most probable determinants of iron and sulfur redox transformations in D. alkaliphilus.;  We propose that sulfur-enriched soda lakes could be secondary habitats for D. alkaliphilus compared to Fe-rich serpentinites, and that the ongoing evolution of Dethiobacterales could retrace the evolutionary path that may have occurred in prokaryotes at a turning point in the biosphere’s history, when the intensification of the sulfur cycle outweighed the global significance of the iron cycle.;  The 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic reconstruction placed the first isolate of D. alkaliphilus within a deep lineage of Firmicutes (now Bacillota) related to the order Syntrophomonadales and syntrophic acetate-oxidizing haloalkaliphiles from soda lakes, with Ca.;  Further phylogenomic reconstruction based on 120 single-copy conservative markers (Parks et al., 2018) rooted D. alkaliphilus as a separate class “Dethiobacteria,” order “Dethiobacterales,” and family “Dethiobacteraceae” (Sorokin and Merkel, 2019).; The aim of our work was to fill the knowledge gap on the metabolic pathways driving the respiration of sulfur and iron compounds in D. alkaliphilus strains.;  We also collected the data on the geology of the Lake Magadi and the Fe-depleted subsurface Yessentuki aquifer to assess the significance of geochemical factors in the evolution of D. alkaliphilus energy metabolism.; Growth of D. alkaliphilus strains was monitored by direct cell counting using an Axio Lab.A1 phase-contrast and fluorescent microscope (Zeiss, Germany).; Screening of the genomes of both D. alkaliphilus strains for multiheme cytochromes and their sequence analysis was performed as previously described (Toshchakov et al., 2018) using reported cytochromes, involved in extracellular electron transfer (EET) in Geobacter sulfurreducens, Shewanella oneidensis, “Thermincola potens,” Carboxydothermus ferrireducens (Gavrilov et al., 2021 and references therein), the dataset of cytochrome query sequences was supplemented with multiheme proteins reported to be involved in Fe(III) respiration or other EET processes in the thermophilic Fe(III) reducers Carboxydocella thermautotrophica (Toshchakov et al., 2018) and Melioribacter roseus (Gavrilov et al., 2017), anaerobic Fe(II) oxidizing bacteria Sideroxydans lithotrophicus, Gallionella capsiferriformans, and Dechloromonas aromatica (Chakraborty et al., 2005; Emerson et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2012), Fe(III) reducing and syntrophic archaea (Mardanov et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2015; Krukenberg et al., 2018; Kashyap and Holden, 2021).;  Heme-binding motifs in D. alkaliphilus multihemes were predicted as previously described (Mardanov et al., 2015).;  The resulting sets of 48 amino acid sequences for the SirA query and 342 sequences for MtoA query were amended with the sequences of SirA, or the MtoA homologs from the genomes of D. alkaliphilus strains (Supplementary Table S1).;  The immunoglobulin-like domains were omitted from the sequences of D. alkaliphilus to decrease non-specific alignments within the protein sets.; For proteomic analysis, biomass of D. alkaliphilus strain AHT1T grown with H2 and thiosulfate or SF as the electron acceptors was harvested from 100 mL cultures by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 15 min.;  Label-free protein quantification was made by MaxQuant software version 1.5.6.5 using D. alkaliphilus strain AHT1 amino acid FASTA dataset and a common contaminant database through the Andromeda search engine according to the previously described protocol (Gavrilov et al., 2021).;  Next, we analyzed the similarity of these sequences to the 16S rRNA gene sequences of D. alkaliphilus strains AHT1T and Z-1002 using BLASTN (Altschul et al., 1990), discarding all sequences with less than 94.5% similarity to these cultured strains of the genus.; The Fe(III)-reducing strain of D. alkaliphilus, Z-1002, was previously isolated in a pure culture with SF and formate under highly alkaline conditions (Zavarzina et al., 2018).; Considering the metabolic features of D. alkaliphilus isolate from the lake Magadi, we tested the ability of the type strain AHT1T for dissimilatory iron reduction.;  Ferrihydrite-grown cells of both D. alkaliphilus strains were strongly associated with iron minerals (Figure 2).;  Detailed statistics of both D. alkaliphilus genomes can be found in Supplementary Table S2.;  Based on a modern phylogenomic reconstruction approach using 120 single-copy conserved marker genes (Parks et al., 2022), D. alkaliphilus has been classified as an individual class of “Dethiobacteria” (Sorokin and Merkel, 2022).;  Apart from D. alkaliphilus, this class includes only metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs).;  According to the results of our phylogenomic analysis based on the same method, the MAGs of the Dethiobacteraceae family appeared to form two distinct phylogenetic clusters: one containing D. alkaliphilus and the MAGs from serpentinizing environments, and another containing MAGs from anaerobic digestion facilities and organic wastes (Figure 3).; As expected, both strains of D. alkaliphilus possess similar gene sets determining central metabolic processes.;  No genes of energy-converting hydrogenases have been identified in D. alkaliphilus.;  The majority of multihemes from both D. alkaliphilus strains share similarity with the proteins previously reported to be involved in EET to Fe(III) minerals in Geobacter, Shewanella, Thermincola, Carboxydothermus species, or in Fe(III)-reducing archaea (Supplementary Table S1).;  The majority of EET-related multihemes, whether putative Fe(III) reductases or Fe(II) oxidases, are encoded by clustered genes in both strains of D. alkaliphilus.; Clusters of EET-related genes and their close genomic neighborhood in D. alkaliphilus strains AHT1T (marked with bold text) and Z-1002.; Both strains of D. alkaliphilus possess three more EET-related gene clusters identical to each other (Figure 4).; Considering a rare case of the appearance of both Fe(III) reduction, and Fe(II) oxidation determinants in a single organism, we have analyzed the homologs of MtoA proteins from D. alkaliphilus strains in more detail.;  Phylogenetic reconstruction of the multiheme domains of all the MtoA-like proteins from both D. alkaliphilus strains (DealDRAFT_1439, 1454, 1457, and OMD50_RS14355, 14365, 13520), together with related MtrA/D homologs from this species (DealDRAFT_1094, OMD50_RS14375, 09855), revealed separate clustering and deep phylogenetic branching of all D. alkaliphilus proteins from previously described DmsE-family decahemes involved in Fe(II) oxidation or Fe(III) reduction (MtoA proteins or MtrA/D proteins, respectively, Supplementary Figure S4).; It was previously noted that the sulfur- and thiosulfate reducing type strain of D. alkaliphilus does not possess any canonical determinants of sulfate, sulfur, or thiosulfate respiration—neither DsrAB complexes, nor molybdopterin oxidoreductases.;  However, strain Z-1002, incapable of sulfur reduction, possesses a sulfhydrogenase cluster too, that raises doubts about the involvement of sulfhydrogenases in sulfur respiration of D. alkaliphilus.;  All these D. alkaliphilus multihemes also share homology with previously described EET-related cytochromes (Supplementary Table S1).;  Phylogenetic reconstruction of all the SirA and Otr homologs from D. alkaliphilus, together with its OmhA and OcwA homologs taken as an outgroup, revealed a deep branching of the octahemes from a common ancestor of both Otr- and SirA-like proteins.;  The evolutionary history of the octahemes from D. alkaliphilus is likely to include their early branching off the common ancestor of Otr- and SirA-like proteins with rather rapid further separation of the DealDRAFT_1,454 protein and the ancestor of highly similar DealDRAFT_1917 and OMD50_RS07060 cytochromes.; The consensus trees constructed after Bayesian inference of phylogeny from the MAFFT alignment of SirA and Otr cytochromes of S. oneidensis, their homologs from D. alkaliphilus strains, and best blast hits from public databases.;  Homologs of SirA and Otr proteins from D. alkaliphilus genomes are summarized in Supplementary Table S2.;  Labels of the proteins are colored red for the proteins retrieved from D. alkaliphilus strains, cyan for the manually added Otr octaheme tetrathionate reductase from S. oneidensis and black for the other proteins.;  Only a single protein homologous to SirA sulfite reductase (22% identity), DealDRAFT_1917, was reliably upregulated during D. alkaliphilus growth on thiosulfate.; Differential expression profiles of multiheme cytochromes of D. alkaliphilus strains.;  These proteins are likely to comprise the core part of the EET pathway driving the redox transformation of Fe minerals in D. alkaliphilus.;  Fluorescence microscopy of mineral samples taken from these cultures revealed that mineral particles were densely settled with rod-shaped cells of different length. 16S rRNA gene profiling of the Fe(III) reducing enrichments revealed the predominance of Dethiobacter phylotypes (96% identity with D. alkaliphilus) in the culture with SF and formate (33.2% relative abundance) and their complete absence in the culture with SF and acetate (Figure 7, 4th and 5th columns, respectively).; Both D. alkaliphilus strains appeared to lack canonical genomic determinants of sulfur, sulfate or thiosulfate reduction, such as DsrAB or molybdopterin-containing complexes.;  Phylogenetic reconstruction of these putative determinants of sulfur compounds reduction revealed deep branching of three of them from the common ancestor of SirA and Otr proteins, and association of two D. alkaliphilus proteins with OcwA/OmhA Fe(III) reductases (Figure 5), which are structurally similar to, but phylogenetically distant from octaheme sulfite or tetrathionate reductases (Soares et al., 2022).;  All these facts emphasize that the reduction of sulfur compounds in D. alkaliphilus is most likely driven by multiheme cytochromes homologous to Fe-cycling proteins.; Genomic analysis revealed that each of the D. alkaliphilus strains contained a large set of genes encoding multiheme c-type cytochromes, including those homologous to quinol-oxidases, membrane-associated Fe(III) reductases, such as OcwA or MtrA/D, and soluble electron shuttling cytochromes, previously identified in the model Fe(III)-respiring bacteria of the genera Shewanella and Geobacter or in Gram-positive thermophilic Fe(III) reducers (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table S1).;  Phylogeny reconstruction of these and other MtoA homologs of D. alkaliphilus (DealDRAFT_1454, 1457, OMD50_RS14520) revealed clear separation of these proteins from DmsE-family decahemes of other organisms that perform Fe(III) reduction or Fe(II) oxidation (Supplementary Figure S4).;  Branching most deeply from the common ancestor of all the D. alkaliphilus decahemes is the phylogenetic cluster of MtoA-like cytochromes DealDRAFT_1439, OMD50_RS14355, and OMD50_RS14365 (Supplementary Figure S4), as well as the protein OMD50_RS14375 with closer homology (24% identity) to the MtrD Fe(III)-reducing cytochrome of S. oneidensis (Shi et al., 2012).;  In general, multi-omics analysis revealed that the biochemical machinery of Fe redox cycling in D. alkaliphilus strains is more complex and flexible than that of sulfur respiration.; The most likely quinol oxidizing/quinone reducing proteins of the respiratory chains in both D. alkaliphilus strains are the CymA-like homologs DealDRAFT_1449 and OMD50_RS14415 with their stable expression level almost independent of the electron acceptors or donors provided (Figure 6).;  Interestingly, the putative Fe-cycling multiheme proteins of D. alkaliphilus showed greater divergence from each other than that observed among the EET-related proteins of the DmsE family from fairly different bacteria.;  These facts highlight the intricate weaving of EET pathways, that determine the redox transformations of sulfur and iron compounds in the organism, which could be a manifestation of the active evolution of multiheme proteins within D. alkaliphilus species, characteristic of the ongoing adaptation of an evolving population to the changes in its environment (Zheng et al., 2019).; The phylogenetic reconstruction of the determinants of key catabolic processes, sustaining the growth of two D. alkaliphilus strains (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S4), offers insights into the evolutionary traits which led to the occupation of two different ecological niches by this bacterial species.;  The presence of multiheme cytochromes, sharing their phylogenetic root with OmhA/OcwA Fe(III)-reductases, as the only possible determinants of the reduction of sulfur compounds in D. alkaliphilus allows us to propose that soda lakes are secondary habitats for these organisms comparing to Fe-rich subsurface environments associated with serpentinites.;  In this case, the Fe-reducing D. alkaliphilus could be an alien species for lacustrine sulfur-rich sediments, which was introduced there from the underlying Fe-rich volcanic rocks.;  This fact together with the unity of origin of the sulfur, thiosulfate and Fe(III) reduction pathways in D. alkaliphilus, allows us to propose an adaptation strategy of the organism to the change of its environment from serpentinizing Fe-rich ecotopes to soda lakes.;  Such an example of intraspecific microevolution within D. alkaliphilus shows a possible way of a global adaptive response of prokaryotes to the activation of the sulfur cycle after the appearance of sulfates in the oceanic water and free oxygen in the atmosphere during GOE (Catling and Zahnle, 2020)."

strain Z,83561,37520367,10376724," The type strain AHT1T was described as a facultative chemolithoautotrophic sulfidogen reducing or disproportionating sulfur or thiosulfate, while strain Z-1002 was isolated as a chemolithoautotrophic iron reducer.;  Here, we uncovered the iron reducing ability of strain AHT1T and the ability of strain Z-1002 for thiosulfate reduction and anaerobic Fe(II) oxidation.;  The ability of strain Z-1002 to reduce SF during autotrophic growth with molecular hydrogen or formate in the presence of vitamin solution was previously reported (Zavarzina et al., 2018).;  The pH growth range of strain Z-1002 was determined on BM medium supplemented with 60 g l−1 NaCl and 10 g L−1 NaHCO3. pH lower than 8.0 was adjusted with 6 M HCl, in the range between 8.0 and 9.5—by titrating with 10% Na2CO3 solution, in the range between 9.5 and 10.3—with 12 M NaOH solution.;  Three subsequent transfers were performed to confirm the ability of strain Z-1002 to grow without carbonates.; The sodium chloride dependence of strain Z-1002 was determined on BM medium supplemented with 20 g L−1 NaHCO3 and 40 g L−1 Na2CO3.;  Three subsequent transfers were performed to confirm the ability of strain Z-1002 to grow without chloride.;  Three subsequent transfers were performed to confirm the ability of strain Z-1002 to grow with siderite by Fe(II) oxidation.; Hyperfine parameters of room temperature 57Fe Mössbauer spectra of the siderite-based mineral mixture incubated with the growing culture of strain Z-1002 and in a sterile control medium.; Cellular morphology of Dethiobacter alkaliphilus strains.

(A) Presents the data for all the EET-related cytochromes of the strain AHT1T, which were identified in protein profiles.; In the strain Z-1002, tandem MS identified 1,390 different proteins identified with at least two unique peptides.;  The type strain is a sulfidogen capable of elemental sulfur reduction (Sorokin et al., 2008), as well as of chemolithoautotrophic sulfur disproportionation (Poser et al., 2013, 2016), while strain Z-1002 appears to be incapable of sulfur reduction at all.; We have experimentally demonstrated the ability of the sulfur-reducing strain AHT1T to reduce Fe(III) from SF and the ability of the Fe(III)-reducing strain Z-1002 to oxidize Fe(II) from green rust supplied as a mixture with siderite.;  The result of Fe(II) oxidation by strain Z-1002 was indicated by a 6.4% increase in the relative intensity of the Mössbauer spectra of Fe3+ atoms compared to that of uninoculated controls (Table 1).;  Interestingly, the Fe(II)-oxidizing strain Z-1002 possesses four different homologs of the protein DealDRAFT_1,439 which are encoded in the 2-Fe and 3-Fe clusters.;  We propose that three of the four proteins in this phylogenetic cluster might appear in strain Z-1002 by several duplication events with further minor changes occurred under the evolutionary pressure of the conditions favoring Fe-cycling, such as increased abundance of mixed Fe(III)/Fe(II)-containing minerals.;  Such an assumption correlates with the similarity of expression levels of two MtoA-like cytochromes in strain Z-1002 cells grown under ferrihydrite reducing or Fe(II) oxidizing conditions (Supplementary Table S4 and Figure 6C).;  Another important point is that the homologs of OmhA Fe(III) reductase and SirA sulfite reductase are expressed only under Fe(II) oxidation in strain Z-1002.;  This hypothesis correlates with the geological history and current geochemical characteristics of Magadi soda lake from which the Fe-reducing strain Z-1002 was isolated.; In addition to the characteristics given for the type strain of the species, AHT1T (Sorokin et al., 2008; Poser et al., 2013, 2016; Sorokin and Merkel, 2019), and strain Z-1002 (Zavarzina et al., 2018), the following characteristics should be added to the formal description: both strains of the type species can grow by iron-reduction in the presence of molecular hydrogen, formate, acetate, lactate, succinate, pyruvate, butyrate, propionate or ethanol as the electron donors."
D. radiodurans,1299,20657662,2904767,"The proteome of the radiation- and desiccation-resistant bacterium D. radiodurans features a group of proteins that contain significant intrinsically disordered regions that are not present in non-extremophile homologues.;  Here, we focus on a member of the nudix hydrolase family from D. radiodurans possessing low-complexity N- and C-terminal tails, which exhibit sequence signatures of intrinsic disorder and have unknown function.;  The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of oxidatively damaged and mutagenic nucleotides, and it is thought to play an important role in D. radiodurans during the recovery phase after exposure to ionizing radiation or desiccation.;  Using advanced computational methods we study the biophysical properties of the intrinsically disordered regions in the enzyme nudix hydrolase from the desiccation- and radiation-resistant bacterium D. radiodurans.;  Interestingly, these regions are absent in homologue proteins in non-extremophile bacteria, suggesting that they might be involved in helping the key rescue-and-repair proteins in D. radiodurans, such as nudix hydrolase, adapt to the extreme absence of water.; 
D. radiodurans is a non-motile, non-spore-forming bacterium that belongs to the Deinococcaceae family [27], [28]. It is characterized by an extreme ability to withstand high doses of desiccation and ionizing radiation.;  For example, this bacterium can survive a dose of 5000 Gy of ionizing radiation, inducing more than 200 DNA double-strand breaks, with no effect on its viability [27], [28]. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the high radiation resistance of D. radiodurans are thought to have evolved primarily as a side effect of mechanisms to counter extreme desiccation, as the bacterium thrives in dry, arid environments [27]. Over the years, evidence has accumulated suggesting that there exists no single, dominant mechanism responsible for the extremophilic nature of D. radiodurans, but that rather a combination of different mechanisms is at play [27], [28]. These range from passive structural contributions, such as the increased genome copy number [29], compact nucleotide organization [30], high intracellular concentration of the ROS-scavenger manganese [31], to active enzymatic repair mechanisms, including nucleotide and base excision repair and DNA double-strand break repair [27], [28], [32].;  One potential strategy to address this possibility is to compare the proteome of D. radiodurans with those of its non-extremophile relatives and look for conspicuous differences.;  Recently, one of us has taken exactly this approach and focused on the presence and the putative biological role of ID regions in the proteome of D. radiodurans (Krisko et al., 2010, manuscript submitted to Proteins: Structure, Function and Bioinformatics).;  A subset of proteins in D. radiodurans was identified that contain highly hydrophilic stretches with low sequence complexity, indicative of intrinsic disorder, that are absent in non-extremophile homologues.;  Other family members regulate the concentration of metabolic intermediates and signaling molecules [33]. Interestingly, D. radiodurans exhibits 26 different types of nudix hyrolase, which is about three times more than what would be expected given the size of its genome, and is the highest number per Mbp of any bacterial genome known.;  In particular, it has been reported that the majority of D. radiodurans nudix genes are strongly induced during the stationary phase, which has been implicated in metabolic reprogramming.; We have analyzed the propensity for intrinsic disorder of the UniProtKB Q9RWW5_DEIRA sequence of nudix hydrolase from D. radiodurans (denoted hereafter as DRNH), using several different algorithms for predicting intrinsic disorder in proteins (Figure 1).; There is no high-resolution structure of nudix hydrolase from D. radiodurans.;  However, there exists an X-ray structure of the core region of a highly homologous (E-value of 8e-05) nudix hydrolase from T. thermophilus, including all residues except the N-terminal 80 and C-terminal 40 residues of the D. radiodurans nudix hydrolase.;  Using homology modeling (see Methods), we have generated a model of the nudix hydrolase from D. radiodurans in its dimeric form, with the missing regions modeled in a physically realistic, yet extended conformation.;  How does this view agree with our simulated ensembles of nudix hydrolase from D. radiodurans? In Figure 4, we analyze the sequence complexity of different segments of DRNH as a function of relative solvent accessibility.; The results presented in this paper show on several levels a correlation between the N and C-terminal tails' presence and an increased hydrophilicity of nudix hydrolase in D. radiodurans.;  Namely, under extreme desiccation conditions, D. radiodurans loses large amounts of water and experiences oxidative stress, causing a number of changes.;  We hypothesize that precisely this is the function of the hydrophilic tails of D. radiodurans' nudix hydrolase – they increase the likelihood for the protein to stay in patches of residual water in the cell (i.e. in the more hydrated areas of the heterogeneous cellular matrix), while other proteins denature due to the removal of water (Figure 5).;  The ID regions at the termini of DRNH are unique to D. radiodurans, giving the bacterium a clear evolutionary advantage in harsh environments.; (Left) A D. radioduranscell under physiological conditions, where all proteins are functional. (Right) The same cell in a state of desiccation: There are only patches of water left in the cell.;  A known structure of nudix hydrolase in T. thermophilus (PDB code 1VC8) was thus identified as the closest homologue of nudix hydrolase in D. radiodurans and was subsequently used to model the structure of the latter using Modeller [59]. As input, Modeller was also provided with secondary structure assignments for 3 residues that do not exist in the 1VC8 sequence, but are located in the middle of segments with well-defined secondary structure, as follows: GLY 165: β-strand, ASP 171: β-strand, ARG 205: α-helix.; In order to be able to compare the properties of nudix hydrolase in D. radiodurans to those of typical proteins, we selected and examined a set of representative proteins with known tertiary structure."

Desulfonatronovibrio,698827,21479878,3084936," Among the fifteen newly isolated strains, four belonged to the genus Desulfonatronum and the others to the genus Desulfonatronovibrio.;  On the basis of phylogenetic, genotypic and phenotypic characterization of the novel soda lake SRB isolates, two novel species each in the genera Desulfonatronum and Desulfonatronovibrio are proposed.;  Two of such investigations demonstrated the dominance of the order Desulfovibrionales sequences belonging to two genera, which were also obtained in pure culture from soda lakes, i.e., Desulfonatronum and Desulfonatronovibrio (Scholten et al. 2005; Foti et al. 2007, 2008).;  The total four characterized species in two genera are moderately salt-tolerant alkaliphiles with a very restricted substrate spectrum limited to H2 and formate for Desulfonatronovibrio (Zhilina et al. 1997) and H2, formate and ethanol/lactate for Desulfonatronum (Pikuta et al. 1998; 2003; Zhilina et al. 2005).;  All of them belonged to the already known genera Desulfonatronum and Desulfonatronovibrio, but none were identical to the described species.; According to the phylogenetic analysis, the isolates belonged to the genera Desulfonatronovibrio (which was the dominant group), and Desufonatronum in the order Desulfovibrionales (Fig. 1).;  The eleven Desulfonatronovibrio isolates formed two subgroups.; Cell morphology (phase contrast microphotographs of novel SRB isolates from soda lakes. a–e

Several Desulfonatronovibrio strains were even capable of slow growth at Na+ concentrations 2.5–3.0 M, which is higher than reported for the type species (Fig. 3b, d).;  That probably explains the fact that in enrichments at 2 M Na+ only the members of Desulfonatronovibrio were selected.;  Compatible solute analysis (Supplementary Figure 2) of the most salt-tolerant Desulfonatronovibrio strain AHT9 grown at 2.5 M Na+ demonstrated the presence of two types of organic osmolytes: sucrose (5% w/w) and N-AGGN (N-acetylglutaminylglutamine amide) (approx. 2% w/w).;  In this respect, Desulfonatronovibrio is significantly different from closely related extremely natronophilic genus Desulfonatronospira with a similar metabolism, which synthesizes glycine betaine as the main compatible solute (Sorokin et al. 2008).
;  The results proved that for the novel Desulfonatronovibrio and Desulfonatronum isolates thiosulfate and sulfite dismutation is active even if the cells were grown with an external electron donor indicating that the enzymes involved in dismutation are part of the “normal” sulfate reduction pathway (Tables 5, ​,6).6).;  In the two most actively dismutating strains, Desulfonatronum ASO3-6 and Desulfonatronovibrio AHT22, cells grown at thiosulfate-dismutating conditions reacted only slightly to the addition of an external electron donor (formate) in case of thiosulfate reduction, while sulfite dismutation was completely inhibited in the presence of formate (i.e., the cells shifted to dissimilatory sulfite reduction).; In conclusion, this work demonstrated increased diversity of the lithotrophic SRB populations belonging to the genera Desulfonatronum and Desulfonatronovibrio in soda lake sediments.;  They are obligately alkaliphilic and moderately salt tolerant with a definite tendency for growth by thiosulfate dismutation, which has not been previously demonstrated for the genus Desulfonatronovibrio.;  On the basis of distinct phylogenetic, genetic and phenotypic properties, 11 Desulfonatronovibrio isolates are proposed to be accommodated in two novel species, D. thiodismutans and D. magnus."

Pseudothermotoga thermarum,119394,36362210,9654485," In this work, a novel highly thermo and alkaline-tolerant xylanase from Pseudothermotoga thermarum was overproduced in E. coli and tested as a bleaching booster of hardwood kraft pulps to save chlorine dioxide (ClO2) during ECF bleaching.;  One enzyme in particular, Xyn11, a xylanase from Pseudothermotoga thermarum, showed an exceptional xylanolytic activity at 90 °C and pH 10.5 [11]. Here, this extremophilic enzyme (extremozyme) is integrated in an industrial ECF bleaching sequence of eucalyptus kraft pulp with the aim of increasing pulp bleachability and reducing the need for ClO2 as bleaching agent.; The novel extremophilic xylanase Xyn11 from Pseudothermotoga thermarum, with max. activity at pH 10.5 and 90 °C [11], was assayed as a pretreatment stage (EXZ) of industrial oxygen-delignified eucalyptus kraft pulp with the objective of saving ClO2, and compared with the conventional industrial bleaching sequence (D0EpD1D2) (Figure 1)."

Psychrobacter,56811,32528424,7247812,"Following a screening of Antarctic glacier forefield-bacteria for novel cold-active enzymes, a psychrophilic strain Psychrobacter sp. 94-6PB was selected for further characterization of enzymatic activities.;  The coding sequence of an extracellular serine-protease was then identified via comparative analysis across Psychrobacter sp. genomes, PCR-amplified in our strain 94-6PB and expressed in the heterologous host E. coli.;  Furthermore, we assessed the microdiversity of this enzyme in Psychrobacter organisms from different cold habitats and found several gene clusters that correlated with specific ecological niches.; With this motivation, we have applied comparative genomics within the Psychrobacter genus to specifically identify and clone a gene encoding a cold-active protease in our isolate Psychrobacter strain 94-6PB, and further characterize the physicochemical properties of the expressed enzyme via in vitro analyses.;  Psychrobacter is a bacterium traditionally associated with low temperature environments (e.g., Siberian permafrost, Antarctic soil, seawater and sea-ice, deep-sea, glacial mud etc.) and is considered a model organism for studies on cold adaptation.; The biotechnological potential of Psychrobacter has been attracting increasing attention, for example for bioremediation treatments but also as a source of cold-active enzymes (e.g., lipases/esterases, proteases, β-lactamases, amylases, DNases) that can be used as catalysts in industrial bioprocesses (Dang et al., 2009).;  To contribute to closing the knowledge gap in this area, in this work we provide a description of a new cold-active protease from an Antarctic Psychrobacter together with a demonstration of an easy and effective experimental approach that can be also applied to the search and characterization of other types of microbial biomolecules.;  Psychrobacter strain 94-6PB was selected for further characterization with regard to growth temperature range by measuring the optical density (OD600nm) of cultures in marine broth medium (Difco) at 0, 4, 10, 15, 22, and 30°C.; Genome analysis and all further downstream analyses were performed on a selected bacterium, Psychrobacter strain 94-6PB.;  All genomes of Psychrobacter strains available at the NCBI database were individually searched for protease-coding genes (EC 3.4) and the retrieved sequences were screened with the program SignalP 4.1 (Petersen et al., 2011) for the presence of signal peptide cleavage sites to predict extracellularly released proteins.; The nucleotide sequence of the protease gene identified in our Psychrobacter strain 94-6PB (prot94-6PB) was compared with homolog sequences in other Psychrobacter organisms by multiple sequence alignment using Clustal Omega.;  The latter ones comprised mostly strains of Arthrobacter, Pseudomonas and Psychrobacter strain 94-6PB (Figure 1B).; Representing a model organism for cold-adaptation, Psychrobacter strain 94-6PB was selected for further characterization.;  Based on the almost full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence, this strain was found closest to Psychrobacter glacincola (99%).;  Because strain 94-6PB had no sequenced genome, we PCR-amplified and sequenced the protease-target gene using primers designed on the basis of comparative analysis of homologous genes in other Psychrobacter organisms.;  Search on the NCBI database for all available Psychrobacter genomes, both complete and as scaffolds/contigs, revealed that homologous sequences of a gene coding for an extracellular peptidase (i.e., signal site for extracellular translocation predicted to be at the amino acid in position 31/32) were present in 12 genomes (Supplementary Table S2).; Scheme of the experimental approach used to identify a new protease from the Antarctic bacterium Psychrobacter sp. 94-6PB.;  Target protease-coding gene was PCR-amplified in our strain using a combination of primers designed based on comparative genome analysis across Psychrobacter organisms (A).; Purification of the extracellular protease produced by Psychrobacter sp.; Finally, we sought to investigate how genetically different is the protease of our strain 94-6PB compared with homologous sequences of other 21 Psychrobacter strains from different ecological niches subdivided in three main groups: terrestrial habitats (e.g., soil and permafrost, Arctic and Antarctic), aquatic habitats (e.g., marine water, polluted and pristine, cold and temperate) and host-associated (e.g., skin and intestinal, animals, fish, tunicates).;  Strains of aquatic origin such as Psychrobacter sp. choline-3u-12, P. piscatorii LQ58, P. pacificensis DSM 23406 and Psychrobacter sp.;  However, also Psychrobacter sp.;  Host-associated Psychrobacter sp.;  JCM 18902, Psychrobacter sp.;  JCM 18903 and Psychrobacter sp.;  The overall similarity among all sequences of the serine peptidase enzyme was approximately 80 ± 5%, with some strains such as Psychrobacter sp.;  PRwf-1 and P. lutiphocae DSM 21542, both host-associated, being rather dissimilar from the others and having sequence similarity as low as 66 ± 3%.

E. coli,562,38252174,10803503," Recombinant E. coli cells were subjected to heat, cold, acidic, alkaline, and hyperosmolar stress to evaluate the effects of HSP20 proteins on stress resistance.;  Notably, the overexpression of 15 HSP20s enhanced the stress resistance of E. coli compared to that of the control strain.;  In particular, HSPs from Tepidimonas sediminis and Oceanithermus profundus improved the stress tolerance of E. coli under all tested conditions.;  In addition, E. coli harboring HSP20 from T. sediminis retained cell viability even after heat treatment at 52 °C for 5 days.;  To our knowledge, this is the first report of E. coli tolerance to prolonged (> 100 h) high-temperature stress.;  These findings indicate the potential of thermotolerant HSPs as molecular tools for improving stress tolerance in E. coli.;  In addition, HSP20s encoded by a genomic island improved the cell viability of E. coli at 60 °C (Li and Gänzle 2016).;  Furthermore, heterologous overexpression of HSP20 derived from multiple organisms can enhance cellular tolerance to diverse stresses in E. coli cells (Table 1).; Ezemaduka et al. (2014) demonstrated that the heterologous expression of small HSPs derived from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans allowed E. coli to grow at 50 °C, which is 3 °C higher than its maximum growth temperature.;  In this study, we aimed to introduce 18 small HSP20s from 12 thermophilic and thermotolerant bacteria into E. coli (Table 2) and evaluate their effects on various physical and chemical cellular stresses.;  E. coli strain One Shot TOP10 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for gene cloning, and Rosetta 2 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) or BW25113 was used for the expression of genes encoding each HSP20.;  E. coli strains or their transformants were cultivated in Luria Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C at 180 rpm.;  The constructed plasmids were introduced into E. coli TOP10 cells through a brief heat shock (42 °C, 45 s), and the transformants were cultivated for 14–18 h at 37 °C with appropriate antibiotics (50 µg mL–1 of kanamycin for pET28a-based plasmids; 100 µg mL–1 of ampicillin for pBAD30-based plasmids).;  The pET28a-based plasmids were introduced into E. coli Rosetta2 (DE3) pLysS competent cells.; The viability of E. coli cells was evaluated under extreme conditions (heat, cold, acidic, alkaline, and osmophilic).;  The transformants of E. coli strain Rosetta2 (DE3) pLysS were cultivated to the logarithmic stage (OD600 = ca. 0.7) at 37 °C in LB medium with 50 µg mL–1 kanamycin and 17 µg mL–1 chloramphenicol.;  As a negative control, E. coli cells transformed with empty pET28a (+) vector (Novagen) or pET28a-ivy coding Ivy family C-type lysozyme inhibitor in E. coli (158 aa), a protein with similar molecular weight of HSP20, were used.;  As a positive control, E. coli cells harboring pET28a with genes coding small HSPs from E. coli (ibpA or ibpB), containing functional domains similar to those of the HSP20s from thermotolerant bacteria, or small HSP from C. elegans (CE) were used (Table 2).; Viability of the recombinant E. coli expressing thermophilic HSP20 was tested after long-term heat treatment.;  Two hsp20 genes (O2 and TS in Table 2) that enhance the thermotolerance of E. coli were evaluated.;  Each plasmid was introduced into E. coli strain BW25113.; Eighteen HSP20s derived from 12 genera of thermotolerant bacteria were tested to evaluate their effects on the viability of E. coli under harsh conditions (Table 2 and Online Resource 2).;  We selected the bacterial genes from thermophiles and mesophiles belonging to the diverse taxonomic groups as follows: phylum Pseudomonadota (taxonomic group same as E. coli) [Tepidimonas (TS) and Pseudidiomarina (PH)], phylum Thermotogota (group containing mesophiles, thermophiles, and hyperthermophiles) [Thermotoga (TM) and Kosmotoga (KO)], phylum Aquificota containing chemoautotrophic thermophiles [Thermovibrio (TA), Desulfurobacterium (DT), and Hydrogenobacter (HT)], phylum Deinococcota [Oceanithermus (O1-3), halophilic thermophiles], phylum Rhodothermota [Rhodothermus (R1-3), halophilic thermophiles], phylum Cyanobacteriota [Thermosynechococcus (TE), photosynthetic thermophiles], and phylum Bacillota [Geobacillus (G1–3), spore-forming thermophiles]. Note that Pseudidiomarina (PH) is an exceptionally mesophilic genus.;  This result is consistent with those of previous studies where various small HSPs from eukaryotes and prokaryotes were successfully expressed in E. coli (Table 1).;  Most HSP20s from thermotolerant bacteria used in this study improved the resistance of E. coli to high and low temperatures as well as host’s small HSPs (EA and EB) (Fig. 2).;  In particular, the expression of O2, TE, or TS increased the cell viability equal to or greater than that of EA, EB, and CE from mesophilic organisms, which allowed the growth of E. coli at temperatures higher than its maximum growth temperature (Ezemaduka et al. 2014).;  The abbreviation of HSP20 is corresponding to that in Table 2. “NC” and “ivy” represent specific strains of E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) pLysS carrying different plasmids (pET28a and pET28a-ivy, respectively).;  Compared to the control strains harboring pET28a (NC) or pET28a-ivy (ivy), HSP20 also improved the viability of E. coli to multiple stresses other than extreme temperatures.;  For seven HSP20s (R1, O1, O2, TK, TE, TS, and PH), cell viability under acidic conditions significantly increased than that of the control strain with pET28a-ivy and were more than 100-fold higher compared to that of the control strains harboring empty vector (NC), suggesting that most HSP20s including small HSPs from E. coli enhanced the acid tolerance of E. coli (Fig. 3a).;  In addition, some HSP20s, including O2 and TS, enhanced the viability of E. coli after exposure to high osmotic pressure (10% [w/v] NaCl) (Fig. 3c).;  Two types of HSP20s, O2 and TS, successfully improved tolerance to a variety of stresses in E. coli.; Viability of each mutant under multiple stress conditions: a viability of each mutant exposed to acidic condition (pH 3 for 1 h); b viability of each mutant exposed to alkaline condition (pH 11 for 1 h); c viability of each mutant exposed to high osmotic condition [10%(w/v) of NaCl for 6 h]. The abbreviation of each HSP20 is corresponding to that in Table 2. “NC” and “ivy” represent specific strains of E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) pLysS carrying different plasmids (pET28a and pET28a-ivy, respectively).; We verified whether the maximum growth temperature of E. coli could be increased by HSP20s by O2 or TS expression.;  Although two sets of expression systems, pET28a/Rosetta 2 (DE3) pLysS and pBAD30/BW25113, were tested, HSP20 expression did not affect the maximum growth temperature (47 °C) of E. coli (Online Resource 6).;  Therefore, HSP20 from Tepidimonas affords E. coli to survive after prolonged (> 100 h) high-temperature stress.; We further investigated how HSP20 (TS) contributes to the homeostasis of E. coli under severe conditions.;  Compared with the other thermophiles used in this study, TS (beta-proteobacteria) is phylogenetically similar to E. coli (gammaproteobacteria).;  Therefore, the effective protection of E. coli cellular proteins by HSP20 (TS) may be due to their phylogenetic proximity and compatibility with structurally similar proteins.; In conclusion, we demonstrated the improvement in E. coli stress tolerance by the heterologous expression of HSP20s from thermotolerant microorganisms.;  Expression of several HSP20s enhanced stress tolerance in E. coli as much as or more than those of ibpA and ibpB from E. coli.;  In particular, E. coli with thermotolerant HSPs, such as O2 and TS, exhibited remarkable stress tolerance, comparable to that of C. elegans HSP20.;  These findings indicate the potential of thermotolerant HSPs as molecular tools for improving stress tolerance in E. coli."

N. benthamiana,4100,36131073,9492658," The production of this xylanase by N. benthamiana, which avoids the hindrances derived from the use of E. coli, namely, intracellular production requiring subsequent purification, represents an important step for potential applications in the food industry in which more sustainable and green products are continuously demanded.; Since xylanases are in-demand enzymes for several industrial applications, particularly the digestion of xylan for producing XOS, in this work we analyzed whether the production of one of these enzymes in N. benthamiana using a TMV-derived vector and an export-to-apoplast strategy to facilitate purification is a good alternative to the classic E. coli host.; To evaluate the feasibility of producing recombinant xylanase Xyn11 using plants as biofactory, we first built a series of TMV-derived vectors to express this enzyme in N. benthamiana.;  The vectors were designed to express the xylanase Xyn11 coding ORF with codons optimized for N. benthamiana (Fig.;  We chose the signal peptide of the N. tabacum (1–3)-β-endoglucanase for its reported efficient apoplast targeting in N. benthamiana30.;  The cultures of transformed A. tumefaciens clones were used to infiltrate leaves of N. benthamiana plants.;  Protein extracts from whole N. benthamiana tissues or from apoplastic liquid were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and the gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue.;  Taken together, these results support that the expression of Xyn11 with an export signal peptide in N. benthamiana using the TMVΔCP-SP-Xyn11 vector may be an excellent alternative to E. coli for the recombinant production of this enzyme of industrial interest.; Electrophoretic analysis of protein extracts from N. benthamiana leaves infiltrated with different viral vectors.;  Considering 1 ml of apoplstic fluid is approximately recovered per 1 g of leaf tissue (fresh weight), these correspond to 0.68 ± 0.01 and 0.83 ± 0.04 µg Xyn11 per 1 mg N. benthamiana leaf tissue.;  The electrophoretic analysis of Xyn11 protein produced in N. benthamiana and E. coli (hereafter Xyn11_Nb and Xyn11_Ec, respectively; Fig. 3) reveals differences in the molecular mass due to differences in the genetic constructs used for expression in these two organisms.;  This result suggests that, in N. benthamiana, Xyn11 is not subjected to post-translational modifications, or at least these are not significant enough to change the electrophoretic migration.; Comparative analysis of recombinant xylanases produced in N. benthamiana and E. coli.;  Lane 1, protein markers with size in kDa on the left; lanes 2 and 3, intracellular proteins from N. benthamiana mock-inoculated (lane 2) and inoculated with TMVΔCP-Xyn11 (lane 3); lanes 4 to 6, apoplastic proteins from N. benthamiana mock inoculated (lane 4) and inoculated with TMVΔCP-SP-Xyn11-AG (lane 5) and TMVΔCP-SP-Xyn11 (lane 6).;  Lanes 7 and 8, heat-treated preparations of xylanase Xyn11 purified from N. benthamiana apoplast (Xyn11_Nb) and E. coli (Xyn11_Ec).; Comparative xylanolytic activity of the xylanase Xyn11 produced in N. benthamiana (Xyn11_Nb) and E. coli (Xyn11_Ec).; Comparative structure and pH dependent activity of the xylanase Xyn11 produced in N. benthamiana (Xyn11_Nb) and E. coli (Xyn11_Ec).

H. marismortui,2238,17215355,1783388," This slow water accounts for ≈76% of cell water in H. marismortui.;  It is hypothesized that the slow mobility of a large part of H. marismortui cell water indicates a specific water structure responsible for the large amounts of K+ bound within these extremophile cells.;  If the same principle were to be responsible for K+ binding in H. marismortui, 24–32 moles oxygen per liter of cell water would be required, enormous amounts of oxygen atoms that cannot be supplied exclusively by the organic components of the cell.; Evidence in favor of more than a single phase of water in cell pellets of H. marismortui came initially from H-NMR measurements (3).; Thus, observations obtained by three different physical methods led us to conclude that cells of H. marismortui contain water with two different types (7).;  Therefore, we planned more direct measurements of water diffusion in intact H. marismortui cells by measuring neutron scattering in deuterium-labeled cells.; Here, we describe experiments designed to examine the behavior of H2O in pellets of fully deuterated cells of H. marismortui and E. coli.;  This value is close to those obtained for H. marismortui, i.e., 1.29 ± 0.12 × 10−5 cm2 s−1.;  The rotational correlation time τR = 1/(2DR) in H. marismortui is 1.83 ps, which is reasonably consistent with values for bulk water measured by neutron scattering and NMR (Table 1) (27).;  This finding suggests that it was the bulk water, and not the macromolecule hydration water, that was measured in the IN6 neutron scattering experiments on H. marismortui.; Fig. 2A shows data and fitted spectra for natural abundance (H cells) and deuterated (D cells) H. marismortui cells in H2O.;  The proportions of slow and normal intracellular water detected by neutron scattering in H. marismortui could then be calculated and were found to be 76% and 24%, respectively, of cell water.; Our results on H. marismortui fall into two distinct groups according to the measuring instrument used.; The IN16 and BSS spectrometers (time scale ≈1 ns) detected a large population of protons with very low mobility in H. marismortui (Fig. 2), but not in E. coli (Fig. 3).;  Thus, the water detected by IN16 must be intracellular, providing strong evidence for the presence of water with a very low rate of mobility within H. marismortui cells.;  Significant differences in the dynamics of the NaCl and KCl forms of H. marismortui malate dehydrogenase have also been found by neutron scattering, with the form binding K+ displaying higher flexibility and lower resilience at physiological temperatures (40, 41).; There are two remarkable similarities between the solvent interactions that have been found in purified halophilic proteins and those known to occur in whole cells of H. marismortui: both purified halophilic proteins and whole cells of H. marismortui bind water and salt, and both require high salt concentrations in the bathing medium for viability (halophilic proteins unfold below 2 M KCl or NaCl).;  Halophilic enzyme proteins are active in a wide variety of salt solutions, whereas H. marismortui cells have an absolute requirement for NaCl and MgSO4 in the bathing medium while binding K+ within the cells; isolated proteins do not appear to be selective for Na+ or K+, whereas intact cells show very high specificity toward these ions.;  The arrangement of the water–oxygen atoms in the central cavity of the K+ channel may serve as model to explain how water in the vicinity of protein can bind K+ specifically with a very high affinity in H. marismortui.; In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the water of H. marismortui cells is of exceptionally low mobility, as compared with other cells studied up to now.; Natural abundance and deuterated H. marismortui cells were grown at 37°C to an optical density of 0.8–1 (late logarithmic phase) in medium described (40), in which, for the deuterated material, yeast extract was replaced by deuterated algal extract produced at the Max Planck Institute (Martinsreid, Germany).;  Washed pellets of H. marismortui, which were naturally bright red whether the cells were natural abundance or deuterated, were transferred to aluminum sample holders (4 × 3 × 0.03 cm3).; Experiments on H. marismortui were performed on the IN6 time of flight and the IN16 backscattering spectrometer at the Institut Laue Langevin (ILL), Grenoble, France.; H. marismortui culture was obtained from Prof."

G. thermoleovorans,33941,34669438,8752141," Overall, results from this study support that thermoalkaline springs harbor G. thermoleovorans microorganisms with lignocellulosic biomass degradation capabilities and potential downstream biotechnological applications.;  In this study, results obtained from G. thermoleovorans isolates originating from YNP springs are significant because very few microorganisms from alkaline thermal environments have been discovered to have lignin- and cellulose-biodegrading capabilities, and this work opens new avenues for the biotechnological valorization of lignocellulosic biomass at an industrial scale.;  G. thermoleovorans isolates obtained from these two representative thermal springs were successfully cultured in the laboratory and investigated using lignocellulosic substrates, including lignin, cellulose, and xylose, with incubations at pH 8.5 and 70°C.;  Some G. thermoleovorans isolates displayed a particular phenotype in the presence of lignin as the sole carbon source, forming a biofilm structure that was not observed when grown on cellulose or xylose.;  Overall, the combination of culturing, geochemistry, and analytical (nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR] and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry [LC-MS]) techniques used here suggests that both thermoalkaline springs contain G. thermoleovorans species with promising potentials for the utilization of LCB with downstream biotechnological applications.;  Among thermophilic Gram-positive Geobacillus and Bacillus species, G. thermoleovorans strains have the broadest tolerance to a wide temperature range, from 35°C to 78°C, with a pH range of 6.2 to 9.0 (19,–22).;  Among the G. thermoleovorans species represented in the closest BLAST matches, and which have a full genome sequence available in the NCBI database, none were isolated from both high temperature and high pH environments (see Table S2).;  A thorough search of the current literature failed to reveal reports of G. thermoleovorans species isolation from thermoalkaline environments.;  Several G. thermoleovorans genomes have been sequenced; five of these assembled to at least scaffold level in the GenBank database.;  Identification of carbohydrate metabolic enzymes (CAZymes [15]) identified in the five genomes of G. thermoleovorans in GenBank indicates that all sequenced isolates contain genes coding for enzymes known to be active in lignocellulose degradation (data not shown).;  In addition, each organism contains a single copy of the Mn superoxide dismutase gene (codA) and an additional gene characterized as codA-like, suggesting that G. thermoleovorans may have multiple metabolic pathways for lignin degradation.; A phylogenetic comparison of 16S sequences from the different isolates was performed to identify potential relationships between the G. thermoleovorans strains, the thermoalkaline springs, and the lignocellulose substrates used for the enrichment cultures.;  The phylogenetic tree does not reveal any correlation between the clustering of the isolates and the type of carbon substrate used, or the geothermal spring from which they were isolated (Fig. 2), indicating that G. thermoleovorans is ubiquitous in these springs over a range of temperatures (70 to 80°C) and alkaline pH (8.4 to 8.5) (Fig. 1 and Table 1).;  While this does not support our hypothesis that the Treefall spring specifically hosts a microbial population capable of degradation complex carbon substrates, the close sequence similarity of these different G. thermoleovorans strains suggests that they might be capable of degrading lignin, cellulose, and xylose, and potentially a variety of other carbon substrates using laccases, cellulases, and xylanases, as has been reported for other G. thermoleovorans strains isolated from various natural environments (19, 23,–27).; Selected G. thermoleovorans isolates from the lignin, cellulose, and xylose plates were further incubated in liquid cultures with 0.5 g/L of the corresponding carbon substrate, at 70°C (pH 8.5), under aerobic conditions.;  Selected G. thermoleovorans colonies isolated from the Five Sisters 2 (FS2) and Treefall (TF) springs exhibited distinct gas profiles during culture on the lignin substrate, potentially indicating level of variability, or different growth performances or metabolic processes (Fig. 3A).; Headspace oxygen and carbon dioxide content (%) measured over time by GC in the lignin cultures containing G. thermoleovorans isolates from FS2 (squares) and TF (triangles) thermoalkaline springs, compared to the noninoculated controls (crosses).;  Overall, the G. thermoleovorans isolates from both the FS2 and TF springs consumed a total of 1 to 2.2 mg of O2 during the two incubation periods on the different lignocellulose substrates and produced 0.2 to 1 mg of CO2, while very little change in concentrations were detected in the noninoculated control.;  This is in accordance with our hypothesis that natural thermoalkaline conditions in hot springs are compatible for both thermochemical solubilization and biodegradation of lignocellulose by G. thermoleovorans.;  However, the G. thermoleovorans cultures exhibited significantly higher simultaneous O2 consumption in the headspace and CO2 production from the lignocellulose substrates compared to the negative controls, indicating that significant biodegradation was occurring at 70°C and pH 8.5.;  Moreover, our assays of cellulose degradation (Fig. 3B) seem to indicate that our G. thermoleovorans strains may be capable of further degrading cellulose, a substrate that remains insoluble in those mild alkaline conditions (12).; When visually examining the culture tubes during the experiments, the formation of a biofilm structure was observed in some of the G. thermoleovorans microbial incubations grown on lignin (see Fig.;  The G. thermoleovorans cells grown from the inoculum from both FS2 and TF springs clumped together, forming a small precipitate at the bottom of the tubes, and remained well attached during the swirling of the liquid cultures.;  The inoculated sample included rod-shaped G. thermoleovorans cells, 0.5 μm wide and 4 μm long, which appeared to be physically connected (Fig. 4B) and surrounding the lignin matrix, possibly embedded within secreted exopolymeric substances.; FE-SEM images obtained from the incubations at 70°C and pH 8.5 with lignin as the only carbon source. (A) Lignin matrix in the abiotic control (Mag = 49.13 KX, WD = 4.8 mm, EHT = 1.00 kV). (B) Formation of a biofilm on the lignin matrix by G. thermoleovorans cells of the TF L C1 isolate from Fig. 2 (Mag = 20.30 KX, WD = 5.1 mm, EHT = 1.00 kV).; In the G. thermoleovorans cultures incubated with lignin, the observed biofilm structures varied in size and were comprised of relatively small (2 to 4 mm wide) or larger (4 to 6 mm wide) floating clumps of G. thermoleovorans cells (see Fig.;  In the absence of a biofilm, the isolates exhibited lower O2 consumption, with concentrations remaining above 12% in the headspace, and a lower CO2 production of ≤2%. We postulate that the different phenotypes (i.e., biofilm versus free-floating) of the G. thermoleovorans isolates may influence their metabolic activities, when lignin was the sole carbon source and the cells were grown at 70°C and pH 8.5.;  These biofilms may also provide important ecological microniches (31) and chemical gradients that could improve G. thermoleovorans tolerance to toxic chemicals generated during the lignocellulose pretreatment in biorefineries (31).; Extracted metabolites from G. thermoleovorans grown aerobically in a minimal salt medium containing either glucose or lignin as sole carbon source (see Table S5) were analyzed using one-dimensional (1D) 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Table 3; see also Tables S3 and S4).;  Metabolic profiles of resulting cell cultures were used to assess the impact of the different carbon substrates on the metabolic responses of the G. thermoleovorans isolates (Fig. 5 and Table 3).;  The 1D 1H NMR spectra of intracellular polar metabolite mixtures extracted from G. thermoleovorans cell pellets grown on glucose or lignin as the sole carbon source (Tables 3 and ​and4,4, Fig. 5A and ​andB)B) were recorded and analyzed.;  This difference is in all likelihood due to the growth advantage of culturing G. thermoleovorans on glucose as the sole carbon source as opposed to the complex lignin polymer (see Table S5).;  Analysis of metabolite extracts of G. thermoleovorans cells grown in the presence of glucose resulted in the identification of 43 polar intracellular and 40 extracellular metabolites (see Table S4).;  Although these differences identified metabolite numbers between the two different cell cultures are most likely due to G. thermoleovorans growing better in the presence glucose as the sole carbon source compared to lignin (as assessed by headspace GC measurements; see Table S6), several observable NMR signals could not be attributed to specific metabolites, as reference spectra were not available in the Chenomx database used for metabolite annotation.; Representative 1D 1H NMR spectra of intracellular metabolite mixtures extracted from G. thermoleovorans cell cultures (isolate TF L C1, Fig. 2), grown aerobically at 70°C and pH 8.5 in minimal salt media with glucose (1 g/L) or lignin (1 g/L) as the sole carbon source, recorded on MSU’s 600-MHz solution NMR spectrometer.; Average concentrations of metabolites in intracellular and extracellular fractions, identified and quantified by NMR, that are common to G. thermoleovorans cell cultures grown in the presence of glucose or lignina; Concentrations of metabolites, identified and quantified by NMR, extracted from 500-ml G. thermoleovorans cell cultures and grown in the presence of lignin as the sole carbon source at 70°C and pH 8.5a; Several identified metabolites were found to be common to G. thermoleovorans grown in the presence of glucose and lignin, and included acetate, formate, fumarate, lactate, pyruvate, and succinate (Table 3).;  This supports that G. thermoleovorans growing on lignin is less metabolically active than when grown in the presence of glucose as the sole carbon source.;  Another interesting compound, 4-hydroxybenzoate, was also detected when G. thermoleovorans was cultured with lignin instead of glucose. 4-Hydroxybenzoate is an aromatic metabolite product of alkaline lignin degradation through the benzoic acid pathway (34), a model lignin compound that can be further converted by bacteria (35).; In a first experiment, representative lignin-degrading G. thermoleovorans isolates from TF spring and one from FS2 spring were incubated in liquid cultures in the presence of lignin (0.5 g/L) as the only carbon source at pH 8.5, 70°C, with air present in the headspace.; Heat maps showing small molecule features measured via LC-MS in liquid cultures with the greatest power to differentiate cultures. (A) G. thermoleovorans isolates from TF (TF L C1; Fig. 2) and FS2 (FS2 L C1; Fig. 2) springs grown on lignin (0.5 g/L) at pH 8 and 70°C.;  The colored boxes highlight the main classes of compounds identified in the samples. (B) G. thermoleovorans from FS2 spring (isolate FS2 L C1, Fig. 2) grown on lignin (0.5 g/L) at pH 7 or 9 and at 60 or 70°C for 13 days.; In a second experiment, a lignin-degrading G. thermoleovorans isolate from FS2 spring was incubated in the presence of lignin (0.5 g/L) as the only carbon source in aerobic cultures (Fig. 6B).;  The pH and temperature modulation of metabolite groupings also revealed that G. thermoleovorans cells cultured at 60°C and pH 7 may be employing different metabolic strategies to optimize growth compared to those utilized by G. thermoleovorans when grown under other temperature and pH conditions.;  Results from our study demonstrate that these G. thermoleovorans isolates could metabolize different lignocellulose substrates as the sole carbon source when grown in liquid cultures and mineralize the organic substrate to CO2.;  In the presence of lignin as the sole carbon substrate, G. thermoleovorans formed biofilm structures that surrounded the complex lignin matrix, and this biofilm phenotype was found to correlate with increased CO2 production under the growth conditions tested in this study.;  The NMR metabolomics studies demonstrated that significant metabolic adaptations take place when G. thermoleovorans is grown on glucose versus lignin as the sole carbon source.;  G. thermoleovorans appeared to be less metabolically active when grown with lignin as the sole carbon source; however, the presence of intracellular syringate suggests that the organism was using lignin as an energy source.;  Overall, the G. thermoleovorans isolates obtained from thermoalkaline springs in YNP demonstrate bioconversion of lignin and cellulose and may represent promising candidates for the valorization of LCB.; In some of the thermoalkaline lignin incubations, the G. thermoleovorans cells appeared to aggregate as a floating biofilm.; Cultures (500 ml) of the isolated G. thermoleovorans with either glucose or lignin (0.5 g/L) as the only carbon source were set up in parallel to characterize the production of extracellular and intracellular metabolite and proteins.;  Cell cultures were inoculated with G. thermoleovorans collected from a lignin cell culture plate and incubated at 70°C and pH 8.5 until the liquid microbial cultures reached exponential phase of growth, as indicated by headspace CO2 concentrations monitored via GC (8 days for the glucose assays and 38 days for the lignin assays).;  In the presence of lignin (0.5 g/L) as the only carbon source, selected G. thermoleovorans isolates from FS2 and TF springs were incubated in liquid cultures (10 ml [final volume in Hungate tubes]) at 70°C and pH 8.5."

(E) Transverse thin section showing the presence of numerous cytoplasmic inclusions, possibly vesicular intracytoplasmic membranes (i).;  In addition to lactate or sulfide, strain SLAS-1T could also use pyruvate and some sugars (e.g., glucose) as electron donors for growth but, notably, not acetate or H2 or acetate plus H2 (Table ​(Table1).1).;  Growth was observed with arsenate, Fe(III), or elemental sulfur as respiratory electron acceptors, but strain SLAS-1T was unable to use nitrate, sulfate, thiosulfate, fumarate, selenate, or Mn(IV) as oxidants.;  Strain SLAS-1T is an obligate anaerobe, being unable to grow under either fully aerobic or microaerophilic conditions (Table ​(Table1).1).;  The pure culture of strain SLAS-1T did not grow when the antibiotic mix of vancomycin, kanamycin, penicillin, and tetracycline was included in the medium.; Electron donors and acceptors tested for growth with strain SLAS-1T; The SLAS-1T isolate was harvested in late exponential phase, when cells express their unique motility.; Fatty acid composition of strain SLAS-1T; Although our prior work indicated CO2 fixation activity in autotrophically grown SLAS-1 strains (40), no RubisCO activity was detected in lysates derived from cells grown either under autotrophic (sulfide as electron donor) or heterotrophic (lactate as electron donor) conditions (data not shown).;  Using this known sequence, we used iPCR and primer walking to sequence the flanking DNA of the original 250-bp SLAS-1T partial arrA gene.; Genomic map (A) and phylogenetic analysis (B) of the arsenate respiratory reductase of SLAS-1T. (A) The arr gene cluster contains at least three genes arranged as arrABD, with likely additional arr genes downstream of arrD. (B) The phylogenetic analysis was performed by using previously established computation methods and representative members of the arsenate respiratory reductase clade of the dimethyl sulfoxide reductase family of molybdenum-containing enzymes (32).; The phylogenetic analysis of the predicted ArrA amino acid sequence of SLAS-1T revealed that it was most similar to the ArrA-like sequence from Natranaerobius thermophilus (64% identity and 81% similarity), a halalkalithermophilic, low-G+C, gram-positive bacterium recently isolated from a saline lake in Egypt (34) (Fig. ​(Fig.2B).2B).;  Although SLAS-1T ArrA was also similar to ArrA-like sequences of Alkaliphilus (55% identity and 72% similarity), the phylogenetic tree showed SLAS-1T ArrA clustered with the Natranaerobius ArrA-like sequence.;  It is also clear that the SLAS-1T ArrA sequence is very distant from the two respiratory ArrA gene sequences annotated in the genome of Alkalilimnicola ehrlichii (located at locus tags Mlg_0216 and Mlg_2426), an arsenite-oxidizing haloalkaliphile.;  The amino acid identities and similarities of SLAS-1T ArrA to the translated products of these arrA-like genes are low: 32 to 33% and 47 to 49%, respectively.;  The SLAS-1T iron sulfur subunit for ArrA, ArrB, was most similar to an ArrB-like sequence in Natranaerobius thermophilus (58% identity and 71% similarity) and the putative ArrBs of Alkalilimnicola ehrlichii and Alkaliphilus oremlandii (55% identity and 69% similarity to both species' ArrBs).;  Although still very similar to Alkaliphilus oremlandii OhILAs (37% and 59% identity and similarity, respectively), the amino acid similarity of SLAS-1T ArrD to the Alkaliphilus metalliredigens strain QYMF putative ArrD was even lower (32% and 50% identity and similarity, respectively).;  The first sequence group, labeled SLAb1-1, was the most abundant in the clone library and was 97% similar to strain SLAS-1T (see below).; Phylogenetic analysis of Halarsenatibacter silvermanii strain SLAS-1T and the antibiotic enrichment culture, showing the relationship of the 16S rRNA genes of isolates and enrichment culture to known species and environmental clones.;  In addition to identifying the SLAb1 arrA phylotype, we also detected the SLAS-1T-specific arrA gene in the antibiotic enrichment culture.;  This was done by using primers designed specifically to target the SLAS-1TarrA.;  These results demonstrate that SLAS-1T and possibly a novel arr-containing prokaryotic strain were present in the antibiotic enrichment culture.; Strain SLAS-1T is classified in the order Halanaerobacteriales, members of which are all halophilic bacteria with fermentative types of metabolism.;  S. shriftii however, is only distantly related to strain SLAS-1T based on its 16S rRNA gene sequences (81%).;  Strain SLAS-1T is more versatile metabolically than S. shriftii, having a broader range of electron donors and a different array of electron acceptors available that support its growth, but it conversely lacks the ability to respire nitrate or selenate (Table ​(Table1).1).; In addition, strain SLAS-1T has a capacity for chemoautotrophic growth using sulfide as its electron donor and arsenate as its electron acceptor, a mode of lithotrophic metabolism first identified for the obligate chemoautotroph strain MLMS-1 (13), as well as other isolates from Mono Lake (15).;  Although strain SLAS-1T can incorporate [14C]bicarbonate into biomass when grown as an autotroph (40), we did not detect any RubisCO activity in the efforts reported herein, a situation similar to that of strain MLMS-1 (13), which in a preliminary annotation of its genome lacked any homologous cbb genes encoding RubisCO (J.;  Strain SLAS-1T fatty acids display similar attributes, containing 31 individual branched-chain and/or multipositional monounsaturated isomers in the range of C14 to C22, and additionally include a novel isomeric suite of unsaturated iso- and anteiso-branched fatty acids (Table ​(Table2).2).;  The highly branched and unsaturated fatty acid composition of SLAS-1T suggests a highly fluid membrane of potential importance to the unique style of motility and necessary flexibility of the cell envelope.; Just how strain SLAS-1T achieves its unusual locomotion is not clear.;  In any case, the unusual motility of strain SLAS-1T allowed us to clearly identify its presence in the antibiotic-fed enrichment culture, a fact that was subsequently confirmed by analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences (see below).;  The SLAS-1Tarr gene cluster contains at least three genes (Fig. ​(Fig.2):2): arrA, encoding a molybdenum oxidoreductase with strong homology to other arsenate respiratory reductases; arrB, encoding an iron sulfur subunit; and a coding sequence for a TorD-like molybdenum cofactor chaperone, arrD.;  Some of these gene clusters contain arrD, which in addition to strain SLAS-1T, is present in Alkaliphilus oremlandii OhILAs, Bacillus selenitireducens strain MLS10, strain MLMS-1, Geobacter lovleyi, and Desulfitobacterium hafniense.;  This observation suggests that SLAS-1T likely contains arsenic resistance genes, which is commonly observed in other genomes of arsenate-respiring bacteria, e.g., Shewanella sp. strain ANA-3 (44).;  Additional sequencing will be necessary to further define the genetic composition of the arr and possible arsenic resistance operons in SLAS-1T.; The presence of an SLAS-1T-like microorganism in the enrichment culture was unexpected because the original isolate had proved sensitive to the antibiotic mixture that was routinely included in the milieu in an effort to screen out bacteria and enrich for archaea.;  Presumably, either this organism, which is apparently highly similar in other features to SLAS-1T, was resistant to the antibiotics or the presence of other microbes in the enrichment somehow ameliorated their inhibitory effects.;  Nonetheless, respiratory arsenate reduction linked to lactate oxidation was noted in the primary enrichment (Fig. ​(Fig.3A),3A), as was chemoautotrophic arsenate reduction linked to sulfide oxidation (Fig. 3A and C), both of which are consistent with the basic metabolic capabilities of strain SLAS-1T (Table ​(Table11).;  These sulfidogenic processes would open niches for the observed sulfide-linked chemoautotrophic growth of strain SLAS-1T.;  This could potentially put them in competition with strain SLAS-1T for available arsenate.; Clearly, extremely halophilic bacteria like strain SLAS-1T fill a niche in Searles Lake and are readily detectable as 16S rRNA gene amplicons at all depths sampled in sediment cores (23) and incubated sediment slurries (24), as well as in the enrichment culture described in this report.;  One dominant phylotype that is likely an HAarrA amplicon was retrieved in the enrichment culture (Fig. ​(Fig.5),5), and this is distinct from a partial arrA gene sequence from the enrichment culture that was identical to that from SLAS-1T.;  The HAarrA amplicons recovered from the enrichment culture may have been linked to the Archaea rather than the Bacteria, as their sequences are significantly different than that obtained for strain SLAS-1T.;  An asterisk indicates that the eSLAS1 arrA sequence is 100% identical to positions 1024 to 1204 of the SLAS-1TarrA gene.;  The G+C content of the DNA of the only strain known in the species is 45.2%. The type strain, strain SLAS-1T, isolated from Searles Lake, CA, has been deposited in the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) as strain BAA-1651."

 We also describe a stable, mixed enrichment culture composed of an extremely halophilic sulfate reducer, an archaeon not previously noted for any ability to respire arsenate, as well as a close relative of strain SLAS-1T.;  After several months of such a transfer/incubation regimen, a stable enrichment culture was established.; A stable enrichment culture of microbes was established using a lactate-arsenate medium (see above) but supplemented (after autoclaving) with an antibiotic mix to favor the development of anaerobic archaea.;  The enrichment culture was maintained with bimonthly transfers and incubated in the dark at 38°C.;  We also used PCR to detect the presence of the arsenate respiratory reductase gene, arrA, within the microbial community of the antibiotic enrichment cultures.;

Phylogenetic analysis of Halarsenatibacter silvermanii strain SLAS-1T and the antibiotic enrichment culture, showing the relationship of the 16S rRNA genes of isolates and enrichment culture to known species and environmental clones.; The functional gene for respiratory arsenate reductase (arrA) was also detected in the antibiotic enrichment culture by using the Halobacterium archaeal codon-biased arrA primer set (HAArrA primer set) that had previously been shown to be effective at amplifying these genes in Searles Lake sediments (23, 24).;  In addition to identifying the SLAb1 arrA phylotype, we also detected the SLAS-1T-specific arrA gene in the antibiotic enrichment culture.;  These results demonstrate that SLAS-1T and possibly a novel arr-containing prokaryotic strain were present in the antibiotic enrichment culture.;

The measured sulfate reduction activity and presence of 16S rRNA gene sequences closely related to those of sulfate reducers within the salt-saturated enrichment culture poses another paradox, namely, that sulfate reducers are thought to be excluded from extremely hypersaline systems as a consequence of energy conservation considerations (41).;  Indeed, we have recently isolated a sulfate reducer from this enrichment culture (strain SLSR-1) that can grow under conditions of salt saturation (J.; Clearly, extremely halophilic bacteria like strain SLAS-1T fill a niche in Searles Lake and are readily detectable as 16S rRNA gene amplicons at all depths sampled in sediment cores (23) and incubated sediment slurries (24), as well as in the enrichment culture described in this report.;

Natronomonas pharaonis,2257,20543878,2881530,"
Natronomonas pharaonis is an archaeon adapted to two extreme conditions: high salt concentration and alkaline pH.;  Results of the analysis include the finding that Natronomonas pharaonis, when grown aerobically on acetate, uses a carbon to oxygen consumption ratio that is theoretically near-optimal with respect to growth and energy production.;  Natronomonas pharaonis is one that has been able to adapt to both high salt concentration and an alkaline pH.;  Specifically, we reconstructed the network by collecting evidence for the existence of reactions from the literature, and then supplemented them with computational approaches, for example by searching the genome of Natronomonas pharaonis for genes that could potentially encode analogs of known enzymes from other organisms.;  Among other results, we found indications that Natronomonas pharaonis regulates its metabolism such that energy production and growth are maximized.;  Despite this however, we also found that Natronomonas pharaonis is only able to incorporate a very small fraction of the total carbon that it consumes (approximately 35%), likely in no small part due to the difficulties posed by its environment.; 
Natronomonas pharaonis is a polyextremophilic archaeon that can be isolated from soda lakes, where it has to cope with two extreme conditions: high salt concentration and an alkaline pH.;  Two strains of Natronomonas pharaonis have been described so far: strain Gabara from lake Gabara in Egypt (DSM 2160) [1], which was used in this study, and strain SP1 from lake Magadi in Kenya (DSM 3395) [2]. Among other results, we show that the microorganism is able to grow on a single carbon source, such as acetate, glutamate and pyruvate, unlike the more well-studied halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum.;  The combination of this capability, a completely sequenced genome [3] and the recent successful development of a transformation protocol (separate publication) will increase the prominence of Natronomonas pharaonis in the study of extremophilic life.; Genome-scale models of metabolism have been constructed and analyzed for various organisms [6], yielding interesting results, such as the prediction of E. coli metabolic mutant phenotypes up to an accuracy of 86% [17], a simulation and characterization of E. coli's secreted metabolites under various nutrient and oxygenation conditions [14], a study of the methanogenic growth of M. barkeri
[18], and an analysis of growth on a relatively complex medium for L. plantarum
[19] and Halobacterium salinarum
[20], [21]. In this work, we present a manually curated, genome-scale metabolic reconstruction for Natronomonas pharaonis, and report on the development and use of a constraints-based model from it.; The reconstructed Natronomonas pharaonis metabolic network is composed of 683 reactions and 597 distinct metabolites.;  Given the relatively recent isolation of Natronomonas pharaonis, its literature base, particularly for subjects relevant to metabolism, is still quite small.; The reconstructed metabolic network for Natronomonas pharaonis is composed of 683 reactions, covering 654 genes, and 597 metabolites.; We obtained an initial draft of the metabolic network by merging the reaction database (LIGAND) from KEGG [22] with the Natronomonas pharaonis genome annotation found in Halolex [23], [24]. The latter resource is a genome information system that specializes in halophilic microorganisms.;  For example, it was recently shown that aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii does not use the classical precursors erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate, but rather proceeds via an alternative pathway that begins with the condensation of 6-deoxy-5-ketofructose 1-phosphate with aspartate 4-semialdehyde [25]. Genetic evidence suggests that the same (or a similar) pathway is in operation in Natronomonas pharaonis.;  Again, genetic evidence suggests that this pathway is also in operation in Natronomonas pharaonis.;  This protein consists of two distinct subunits, which in Natronomonas pharaonis are encoded by NP4044A (beta subunit) and NP4046A (alpha subunit).;  Clearly, a prerequisite for the definition of this reaction for Natronomonas pharaonis is an approximation of the microorganism's average biomass composition, at least under the conditions used.;  Given that proteins typically account for a large fraction, if not a majority, of the organic mass of most microorganisms, we began our characterization of the Natronomonas pharaonis biomass by analyzing its amino acid content.;  For these amino acids, statistical analysis of the predicted Natronomonas pharaonis proteome was used to specify coefficients in the growth reaction (see Growth on Acetate).; 2-Sulfotrehalose has been demonstrated to be an osmolyte used by several haloalkaliphilic archaea, including Natronomonas pharaonis
[27]. This molecule was reported to accumulate in amounts over 2.5 mol per mg protein [27], which translates to about 855g of the compound per mg protein.;  Thus, the likely scenario is that under the conditions used, cells rely predominantly, if not completely, on inorganic ions to counter osmotic stress; a situation that has already been observed for Natronomonas pharaonis under other conditions [27]. Indeed, using NMR to analyze intracellular solutes (see Detection of 2-Sulfotrehalose) we were not able to detect any dissacharide.; It was previously believed that any growth medium for Natronomonas pharaonis would require the presence of leucine because of a disruption in the 2-isopropylmalate synthase gene (NP2206A) [3], which is involved in the biosynthesis of the amino acid.;  Nevertheless, it is now clear that Natronomonas pharaonis is capable of growing (aerobically) on a single carbon source.; The surface represents the theoretical maximum growth of Natronomonas pharaonis as a function of two parameters: (1) the acetate to oxygen ratio and (2) the maintenance energy (in mol ATP per ODml).; It is clearly of interest to compare how the theoretical results summarized in Figure 4 compare to the real-world behavior of Natronomonas pharaonis.; Not much is currently known regarding the biochemistry of the respiratory chain of Natronomonas pharaonis.;  Because of the relatively scarce information available for Natronomonas pharaonis, the P∶O ratio that we used to calculate the maintenance energy above is actually the experimental value for the closely related Halobacterium salinarum, which was determined using oxygen pulse experiments [29], [30]. Thus, the maintenance energy value reported above is still subject to scaling.;  While the observations above, by themselves, say nothing directly about the optimality of the actual fluxes used by the cells, it is at least an argument in favor of the hypothesis that Natronomonas pharaonis, under the conditions, optimizes its metabolism with respect to growth and energy production.;  This capability is suggested by the presence of various enzymes in the genome of Natronomonas pharaonis, so we checked if it is indeed a contributing factor under the conditions used.; 
Natronomonas pharaonis was grown on the single carbon source, acetate.;  Under the conditions used, Natronomonas pharaonis showed a very low carbon incorporation rate of approximately 35%.; We presented a genome-scale, manually curated metabolic reconstruction for the polyextremophile Natronomonas pharaonis.;  In the case of Natronomonas pharaonis, work was limited by the absence of a procedure for genetic modification.;  Accordingly, the recent development of a transformation protocol for Natronomonas pharaonis (separate publication) means that we now have a haloarchaeon for which genetic manipulation is possible and labeling experiments are relatively simple.; In order to complete a constraints-based model for Natronomonas pharaonis, we experimentally determined several physiological parameters.;  The data was integrated with the metabolic reconstruction to create a computational model that we used to analyze the behavior of Natronomonas pharaonis when grown on a single carbon source.;  This supports the hypothesis that, under simple conditions, Natronomonas pharaonis optimizes its metabolism with respect to these two objectives.;  Our eventual goal is to elucidate some of the currently unclear archaeal pathways, for example to identify the exact precursors of archaeal aromatic amino acid biosynthesis [25], and to directly measure the internal fluxes of Natronomonas pharaonis
[31], [32], such as in response to different stimuli.; A prior partial reconstruction of the Natronomonas pharaonis metabolic network was downloaded from the PATHNET database of the Halolex system [23], [24]. We used this as the starting point of our reconstruction.;  Since the current body of metabolic literature for Natronomonas pharaonis is still quite small, data from closely related microorganisms was used, particularly from the intensively studied halophile, Halobacterium salinarum.; For the analysis of growth, Natronomonas pharaonis strain Gabara (DSM 2160) was grown under aerobic conditions using chemically-defined media prepared according to Table 1 of Text S1 (supplementary information).; The formulation of the growth medium (Table S4) used in the analysis of aerobic growth is the result of optimizing previous synthetic media used for Natronomonas pharaonis.; The total organic carbon (TOC) content of the Natronomonas pharaonis biomass was determined by adapting a procedure typically used to determe the TOC of soils.; 
Natronomonas pharaonis was grown in larger volumes (200 ml) to mid-log phase (OD 0.3–0.4), after which cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 g, 30 min)."
P. salinarum,88271,36937286,10020504," Enhanced photosynthetic activity exhibited by P. salinarum in highly saline-alkaline condition is noteworthy as photosynthesis is suppressed under hyperosmotic conditions in most photosynthetic organisms.;  The study provided the first insights into the proteome of extremophilic alga P. salinarum exhibiting extraordinary osmotic adaptation and proliferation in polyextreme conditions prevailing in saline sodic ecosystems, potentially unraveling the basis of resilience in this not so known organism and paves the way for a promising future candidate for biotechnological applications and model organism for deciphering the molecular mechanisms of osmotic adaptation.;  P. salinarum was first reported from a saline pond (100‰ salinity) at the San Francisco Salt Works, California, United States (Lewin et al., 2000; Lopes dos Santos et al., 2016).;  In spite of demonstrating such unique environmental adaptations, flourishing and out competing other primary producers at extreme salinities and influencing the food web dynamics (Krienitz and Kotut, 2010), P. salinarum has gone unreported in most of the culture independent metagenomic studies of saline ecosystems all over, indicating the lack of information about this organism on molecular level.; Recently, an extremely haloalkaliphilic strain P. salinarum SLJS6 was isolated from brine water of the largest inland hypersaline soda lake of India, Lake Sambhar, Rajasthan, India.;  Therefore, in an attempt to identify and understand the underlying mechanisms of osmotic adaptation in P. salinarum SLJS6, the present study was undertaken.; In the present study, a high-throughput label-free quantitation (LFQ) based quantitative proteomics approach was used to study the proteome of haloalkaliphilic algal strain P. salinarum SLJS6 in response to high NaCl and inorganic carbon concentrations (salinity-alkalinity treatment).;  The data available on P. salinarum in protein repositories is limited as only two draft genomes are available till date.;  This study provided the first insights into proteome of extremophilic alga P. salinarum suggesting enhanced photosynthesis and ATP synthesis as the prime strategy to successfully thrive in highly saline-alkaline environments, potentially unraveling the underlying molecular basis of natronophily in this not so known organism which may be exploited for potential biotechnological use and as a model organism for deciphering the molecular mechanisms of osmotic adaptation.; P. salinarum SLJS6 (Genbank Accession no. {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MW750597"",""term_id"":""2006471237"",""term_text"":""MW750597""}}MW750597) was previously isolated from brine water of hypersaline Sambhar soda lake and was found suitable for bicarbonate-based biomass production and carbon capture owing to its remarkable growth in an enriched soda lake medium (M medium) containing high concentrations dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the form of carbonates and high salinity as NaCl (Singh et al., 2022).;  The rationale behind using BG-11 medium as a control for this study was that in our previous experiments, the other microalgal isolates from Sambhar soda lake preferred this BG-11 medium for profound growth whereas P. salinarum grew minimally in the respective medium.;  On the other hand, P. salinarum grew robustly in M medium while others showed declined growth.; P. salinarum SLJS6 is a haloalkaliphilic strain, previously isolated from brine water of hypersaline Sambhar salt soda lake (Genbank Accession no. {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""MW750597"",""term_id"":""2006471237"",""term_text"":""MW750597""}}MW750597) and was found suitable for bicarbonate-based biomass production and carbon capture, owing to its remarkable growth in an enriched soda lake medium (M medium) containing mainly Na2CO3, 50 g/l, NaHCO3, 50 g/l, NaCl, 50 g/l (salinity ≈150 ‰, DIC ≈ 1 M NaHCO3/Na2CO3) at pH 10.;  The proteomes of P. salinarum grown in M medium, subjected to high DIC and salinity were analyzed using LFQ and liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry/ mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS).;  Figure 1 depicts the overall changes in protein abundance in P. salinarum after 3 days of high DIC and salt treatment (MT).;  Of the 225 DAPs of the control and treated P. salinarum, a total of 150 DAPs were significantly altered in response to high DIC and salinity relative to control, with the threshold for upregulated expression, Log2 fold change >1 and downregulated expression Log2 fold change <−1 (p < 0.05).;  Figure 2 depicts the regulation of photosynthetic machinery and C assimilation in P. salinarum SLJS6 under highly saline alkaline conditions as per the results obtained in this study.; Summary of protein changes in P. salinarum SLJS6 in response to high carbonates and NaCl concentrations (highly saline-alkaline environment).; Schematic representation of the regulation of photosynthetic machinery and C assimilation in P. salinarum SLJS6 under highly saline alkaline conditions as per the results obtained in this study.;  P. salinarum SLJS6 was isolated from salt brine (NaCl 345 g/l, pH 10) of a hypersaline soda lake, Lake Sambhar in India.;  Recent culture independent multi-omics study shed light on the microbiome evolution of lake Sambhar in comparison to other saline ecosystems, reported relative abundance of members of Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota domain, with Dunaliella well recognized under Chlorophyceae (Mehta et al., 2021), however, P. salinarum remains unreported.;  Up-regulation of prime metabolic network in P. salinarum SLJS6 as revealed by the identified salinity-alkalinity induced proteins can explain the extraordinary ability of this alga to survive in highly saline-alkaline environments as soda lakes.; The first category comprises many forms of major components of the photosynthetic machinery and the Calvin cycle: As evident from the growth data from our previous study (Singh et al., 2022), the growth of P. salinarum SLJS6 under conditions of high alkalinity (high DIC) and salinity exhibited a sharp increase.;  Figure 2 depicts the regulation of photosynthetic machinery and C assimilation in P. salinarum SLJS6 under highly saline alkaline conditions as per the results obtained in this study.;  It is implied that the photosynthetic Carbon assimilation was increased in P. salinarum grown in M medium under high DIC and salinity conditions.;  In previous experiments conducted for assessing the prospects of isolate SLJS6 as promising candidate for bicarbonate-based biomass production and carbon capture, we found that the growth rate (0.2282 d−1) and biomass productivity (0.498 g/l/d) of P. salinarum was increased many folds (>35) in M medium compared to BG11 medium (Singh et al., 2022).;  The identified induced proteins in P. salinarum in response to high DIC (bicarbonate/carbonate alkalinity) and salinity (NaCl) suggest enhanced photosynthesis and remarkable osmoadaptation at expense of energy and provide insights into the extraordinary ability of this haloalkaliphilic picoalga to flourish in extreme conditions, corroborating to its occurrence in extremely saline-alkaline environments around the world, outcompeting the major primary producers at highest salinities (Krienitz and Kotut, 2010; Krienitz, 2018; Pálmai et al., 2020).;  In that case this innate ability of P. salinarum to enhance photosynthesis is remarkable and must be subjected to intensive exploration.;  Likewise, augmented levels of FBPase class-2/SBPase in our study supports the increased biomass production by P. salinarum SLJS6 in M medium.;  In the proteome of P. salinarum SLJS6 grown in M medium, FBPase/SBPase and FBA were found to be predominantly overexpressed.;  Alpha and beta subunits of ATP synthase (both chloroplastic and mitochondrial) were expressed by more than 4 folds in the M medium grown algal cells, suggesting that extremophile P. salinarum cells produced extra metabolic energy to maintain normal biological functions.;  In the case of P. salinarum, enzyme Peptidylprolyl isomerase, also known as cyclophilin A was highly overexpressed (>12 folds).;  Thus, it is ascertained that P. salinarum maintains its cellular protein structural integrity even in high osmotic stress by highly overexpressing such chaperone proteins.;  Thus, translational regulation in P. salinarum seems rather complex and would need further research and analyses.; By and large, our findings suggest that the haloalkaliphilic picoalga P. salinarum SLJS6 is endowed with innate complex mechanisms to adapt to highly saline-alkaline conditions and based on the knowledge acquired heretofore, it involves up-regulation of proteins and enzymes mainly involved in photosynthesis and carbon assimilation, ATP generation and protein folding-refolding.;  This study provided the first insights into the proteome of extremophilic alga P. salinarum exhibiting tailored regulatory mechanism of osmotic adaptation and proliferation in polyextreme conditions prevailing in saline sodic ecosystems, potentially unraveling the basis of resilience in this not so known organism and paves the way for a promising future candidate for biotechnological applications and model organism for deciphering the molecular mechanisms of osmotic adaptation."

human,9606,32533304,7347518," The quality of drinking water in developed world is strictly regulated to prevent immediate danger to human health.;  At least in fungi, extremotolerance has been linked to human pathogenicity, explaining why many species found in novel indoor habitats (such as dishwasher) are notable opportunistic pathogens.;  As a result, microorganisms that often enter our households with water and are then enriched in novel indoor habitats might have a hitherto underestimated impact on the well-being of the increasingly indoor-bound human population.;  This increases their exposure to indoor microorganisms, the diversity and abundance of which can differ profoundly from natural environments or even human dwellings of the past.; Microorganisms enter buildings with outdoor air, soil, water, living plants and different food products as well as other humans and pets (Weikl et al. 2016; Jayaprakash et al. 2017; Shan et al. 2019; Cooper 2010).;  These bacteria originate primarily from human-associated sources (Hanson et al. 2016; Noris et al. 2011; Rintala et al. 2008; Taubel et al. 2009).;  While becoming more permissive, these conditions are still harsh enough to select for the more stress-resistant, but also often, virulent microbes, with greater potential to cause opportunistic human infections (Byrd-Bredbenner et al. 2013; Callewaert et al. 2015; Döğen et al. 2013a, b; Dunn et al. 2013; Gümral et al. 2016; Gostinčar et al. 2011, 2015; Raghupathi et al. 2018; Rehberg et al. 2017; Sasahara et al. 2011; Ståhl Wernersson et al. 2004; Zalar et al. 2011; Zupančič et al. 2016, 2018).; Research on water-related indoor microorganisms so far mostly focused on bacteria important for human health (Larsen et al. 2010).;  The diversity of these fungal “water-biomes” turned out to be dominated by polyextremotolerant, oligotrophic species, some of which are opportunistic human pathogens, representing a potential health problem that became widely recognised only in the last years (Zalar et al. 2011; Hamada and Abe 2010; Lian and de Hoog 2010; Defra 2011; Fouquier et al. 2016).;  Water for human consumption should not contain potentially harmful microorganisms or dangerous substances, making it necessary to control not only the input water quality, but also the formation of biofilms and increases of the microbial load in the distribution system.;  If present in large quantities, they also change the odour of water and may affect human health via toxin production (Novak Babič et al. 2017a, b).;  Additionally, species from the genera Cryptosporidium, Microsporidia and Giardia can act as human pathogens, causing diarrhoea, nausea, keratitis and encephalitis.;  However, their presence in drinking water can alter the taste and odour of water, while in higher numbers they can impair human health causing allergies, asthma and superficial infections of hair, skin and nails (Defra 2011; Novak Babič et al. 2017a, b).;  All of these are traits they share with some species found in extreme natural environments and also in opportunistic pathogens, for which the infection of the human body can be seen as just another habitat shift exposing them to a new and stressful environment.;  Exposure to microbes comes from handling and preparing food and from contact with kitchen surfaces that harbour microorganisms derived from food, water, air and humans (Medrano-Felix et al. 2011).;  Although outdoor and indoor air and water are known sources of microbial contamination of kitchens, human skin was found to be the primary source of bacteria belonging to the families Propionibacteriaceae, Corynebacteriaceae, Staphylococcaceae and Streptococcaceae (Flores et al. 2011; Flores et al. 2012).;  Species that should cause the most concern are human opportunistic fungi, able to cause diseases in immunocompromised people, particularly species secreting extracellular polysaccharides (EPS).;  These species can form mixed bacterial-fungal biofilms and can thus adhere more easily to human hands (e.g. species from genera Candida, Cryptococcus, Malassezia and Rhodotorula).;  The major ones are tap water, human skin and oral biota, and faecal contamination (in case of coliform bacteria) (Ankola et al. 2009).;  Food-colonising fungi can pose a risk not only because of their potential virulence, but also due to their production of mycotoxins, some of which are detrimental for human health (NSF 2013).;  Understanding of the complex influence of materials on indoor microbiota will help us build indoor spaces and equip them in a way that will have predictable impacts on the diversity and abundance of microbes with the aim to minimise health hazards and promote human well-being (National Academies of Sciences).;  The hot spots of these microorganisms are not so much the surfaces touched and contaminated by humans or animals, but much more the habitats with high availability of liquid water.;  We now know that some biofilm-forming species including those pathogenic to humans can grow on polyethylene, polypropylene, rubber, stainless steel and other materials (Tsiaprazi-Stamou et al. 2019).;  Fungi that successfully infect a human body have to overcome several obstacles, such as high temperature (Robert and Casadevall 2009), oxidative bursts of human phagocytes and severe iron limitation (Hamad 2008; Kumamoto 2008), and low water activity and low pH in case of skin penetration (Elias 2007).;  Instead, the evolution of their invasive potential is uncoupled from their hosts and tightly linked to their polyextremotolerant ecology, the same ecology that is also behind their ability to inhabit and thrive in various indoor habitats and use the opportunities created by the changes in human lifestyle and indoor environments.;  Standard microbiological tests are—with few exceptions—designed to control the presence of the most medically relevant bacteria that represent health risks to humans and animals.;  Such large adaptability and stress-tolerance is thought to be linked to the great capacity of these fungi to colonise novel and generally inhospitable habitats, including the human body (Gostinčar et al. 2011).;  While the number of studies supporting this observation is steadily increasing, more epidemiological and experimental approaches are needed to further elucidate the role of the domestic water microbiome in human health.; The present work did not include any animal or human samples or patient data."

With the exception of the Porphyrobacter strains (one out of five was positive), strains from the same genus were either positive or negative.;  Therefore, algal blooms occur frequently in shallow soda pans (Somogyi et al. 2009), but the observed dual bloom (simultaneous presence of algae and purple bacteria) is uncommon (Borsodi et al. 2013).;  The dense layer of algae hinders mixing and makes favorable light conditions for phototrophic purple bacteria in the deeper layer (Vörös et al. 1998; Stomp et al. 2007).; Comparing the revealed BCC in this anonymous soda pan with a previous Oocystis-associated purple bacterial bloom in a neighboring soda lake (Böddi-szék), significant differences were found (Figs. 1 and ​and2).2).; A dual bloom of green algae and purple bacteria in a Central European soda pan was characterized in this study."

human,9606,28737704,5532675," Beyond a comprehensive analysis of cyanotoxin presence in each of the extreme environments, this review also identifies the main knowledge gaps to overcome (e.g., scarcity of isolates and –omics data, among others) toward an initial assessment of ecological and human health risks in these amazing ecosystems developing at the very edge of life.;  Cyanotoxins are a group of chemically diverse substances (e.g., alkaloids, cyclic peptides, non proteic amino acids) with documented adverse effects on humans, animals, plants and eukaryotic microbes [6]. According to their effects, cyanotoxins can be classified into hepatotoxins (e.g., the cyclic peptides microcystins -MCs- and nodularin –NOD-), neurotoxins (e.g., the alkaloids anatoxin-a, anatoxin-a (S), and paralytic shellfish toxins –PSTs- or saxitoxins) and cytotoxins/dermatotoxins (e.g., the alkaloids cylindrospermopsin –CYN- and lyngbyatoxin).;  As such, there is vast scientific literature on the ecology and fate of cyanotoxins in temperate freshwater ecosystems and some coastal areas, including also a number of documented cases of animal and human intoxications [6,8]. In contrast, the scarcity of information on the presence of cyanotoxins outside those ecosystems is striking.; Importantly, toxins from Arthrospira in tropical and subtropical lakes may pose an actual threat to human beings.;  We could argue this both from the point of the quantitative production of toxins—expected to be lower in extreme systems because of the less usual development of mass proliferations—as well as from the apparently reduced exposure of ecosystem organisms—extreme areas are in general expected to be less biodiverse than those in mild conditions; and they often coincide with areas with a very low human population density.; Regarding human health risk assessment, an aspect to consider is that exposed populations could be more abundant than one could initially assume, including: (a) natives in close contact with the natural environments (e.g., the Inuit in the Arctic), which in some areas even use the cyanobacterial biomass itself as food supplement (e.g., African population use Arthrospira biomass collected from certain lakes) [92]; (b) professionals like the Army working in hot deserts [50,51] or in Antarctica, and scientists/researchers specially in polar bases like those in the Antarctica; (c) tourists, which are increasing their number in the last years toward unusual destinations such as hot spring areas and even to the Antarctica.; Hopefully, the fulfilment of the research gaps summarized here, together with others arising on the way, will enable researchers to better understand the driving forces of cyanotoxicity in extreme environments, as well as to present an actual dimension to its consequences for ecosystems and human health."

uncultured,198431,30231921,6146748," Here, we performed metagenomic sequencing on soda lake sediments to give the first extensive overview of the taxonomic diversity found in these complex, extreme environments and to gain novel physiological insights into the most abundant, uncultured prokaryote lineages.;  Most OTUs were assigned to uncultured families.; So far, all characterized prokaryotic lineages cultured from soda lakes comprise over 70 different species within more than 30 genera [1, 6, 9, 10]. From these, only a limited number of genomes have been sequenced today, mostly from chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the genus Thioalkalivibrio (class Gammaproteobacteria) [1, 11, 12]. It is well established that metagenomics enables the recovery of genomes and the identification of novel genetic diversity where culturing efforts fail [13, 14]. In recent years, next-generation sequencing has recovered a massive number of genomes from previously unknown groups of prokaryotes [15, 16], including a strikingly large and diverse group called “Candidate Phyla Radiation” (CPR), only distantly related to other cultured bacterial lineages [17]. Previously, we conducted a metagenomics study on soda lakes and reconstructed novel genomes from uncultured Bacteroidetes and “Candidatus Nanohaloarchaeaota” living in hypersaline Siberian soda brines [7]. Here, we turned our attention to the far more complex prokaryotic communities living in the sediments of the hypersaline soda lakes from the same region.;  We give a broad overview of all the taxonomic groups sequenced and focus on the metabolic diversity found in the reconstructed genomes of the most abundant, uncultured organisms.;  The prokaryotic communities of all five sediment samples were highly diverse and consisted mostly of uncultured taxonomic groups.;  Most Euryarchaeota-related OTUs detected by amplicon sequencing belonged either to the uncultured Thermoplasmata group KTK 4A (SILVA classification) or the genera Halohasta and Halorubrum (class Halobacteria).;  The second most abundant Firmicutes order was Halanaerobiales, particularly the genus Halanaerobium (family Halanaerobiaceae) and uncultured members of the Halobacteroidaceae.;  The uncultured ML635J-40 aquatic group (order Bacteroidales) comprised at least 5% of all five prokaryotic communities.;  This group has been previously found to be abundant in Mono Lake [4] (a soda lake) and in an anoxic bioreactor degrading cyanobacterial biomass under haloalkaline conditions [19]. Two other highly abundant (up to ~ 8%) uncultured groups from the class Balneolia (proposed new phylum Balneolaeota [18]) were also detected in other soda lakes before [3, 4]. Within the Gammaproteobacteria, the genus Thioalkalivibrio was abundant (~ 3% of the total community), but also uncultured members of HOC36 were prevailing at moderate salinities.;  All OTUs within the Thermotogae and Lentisphaerae belonged to uncultured genera from the family Kosmotogaceae and Oligosphaeraceae, respectively.;  Many MAGs belonged to uncultured groups commonly detected in soda lake 16S rRNA gene surveys, over 100 MAGs still belonged to candidate prokaryote phyla and divisions that to our knowledge were never detected before in soda lakes, including CPR.; A second novel, uncultured lineage of Gammaproteobacteria that was highly abundant at moderate salinities branched in our ribosomal protein tree as a sister group to the family Halothiobacillaceae.;  All 16S rRNA gene sequences found in the MAGS had 86–95% identity to sequences obtained from uncultured organisms related to the genus Dethiobacter.;  Acetothermia”), and the class LD1-PA32 (Chlamydiae), suggesting all these uncultured organisms might be heterotrophic acetogens.;  However, as many of the abundant lineages and groups found in soda lake sediments are still uncultured, metagenomics proved to be a helpful tool to gain primary insights in the potential physiology and ecology of these poly-extremophilic prokaryotes."

tufae n. gen., n. sp. has thus far only been reported from Mono Lake, two other putative species of the new genus (represented by strains EJR13 and NKZ329) have been isolated from dung beetles, a finding that will be described elsewhere (Ragsdale and Kanzaki, in prep.).;  Specifically, the female and hermaphrodite of T.
tufae n. gen., n. sp. has a vagina comprising layers of stretched, elongated cells surrounding a Z-shaped vaginal duct.;  Since T.
tufae n. gen., n. sp. was isolated from the arsenic-rich environment of Mono Lake, we speculate that maternal investment in Tokorhabditis n. gen. was a preadaptation to the extreme stressors of that environment.;  Our results suggest a trade-off between obligate vivipary and fecundity: selfing hermaphrodites of T.
tufae n. gen., n. sp. produce an average of 115 progeny, which we found to be far less than the mean brood size of C.
elegans as well as a representative of Auanema (A.
rhodensis).;  The small brood size of T.
tufae n. gen., n. sp. suggests a greater investment toward the development of individual progeny over the production of large broods in this species.;  However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the laboratory conditions used in this study were sub-optimal for T.
tufae n. gen., n. sp. growth and thereby also reduced its brood size.; Clues to the mechanism of viviparity in T.
tufae n. gen., n. sp. can be obtained from the mechanisms of maternal care in C.
elegans.;  This raises the question of whether nutrient transport in T.
tufae n. gen., n. sp. viviparity involves similar signaling pathways and shortening of lifespan.;  Further studies of vivipary in T.
tufae n. gen., n. sp. will be useful for comparing how nutrient transport and reproductive aging have diverged between this species and the well-characterized C.

purple bacteria,1224,35630403,9146400,"Halorhodospira (Hlr.) species are the most halophilic and alkaliphilic of all purple bacteria.; Purple phototrophic bacteria have evolved to adapt to various conditions, and some species thrive at extremes of temperature, salinity, and pH [1,2]. Halorhodospira (Hlr.) halochloris (formerly Ectothiorhodospira halochloris) is a purple sulfur bacterium (Gammaproteobacteria) that was isolated from warm and extremely saline and alkaline Egyptian soda lakes [3]. Hlr. halochloris is the only known triply extremophilic anoxygenic phototroph, displaying a thermophilic, halophilic, and alkaliphilic phenotype; the organism grows optimally at 47–50 °C, pH 8–9, and 14–27% (w/v) salinity [4]. Hlr. abdelmalekii (formerly Ectothiorhodospira abdelmalekii), isolated from alkaline soda lakes of the Wadi Natrun in Egypt, is a mesophilic counterpart of Hlr. halochloris, growing optimally at 30–40 °C, pH 8.5, and 14–16% (w/v) salinity [5]. Both of these phototrophs assemble their light-harvesting machinery with bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) b [2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]; because of this, they are part of a distinct minority (< 5%) of known purple bacteria.;  The light-harvesting 1 (LH1) complexes of BChl b-containing purple bacteria exhibit Qy absorption bands at wavelengths beyond 1000 nm whose energy is much lower than that absorbed by BChl a-containing purple bacteria, whose LH1 complexes typically absorb near 880 nm [13]. ;  Based on our experimental results, along with comparative sequence analyses of relevant LH1-RC proteins, the molecular strategies employed by Hlr. halochloris to maintain functional LH1-RC complexes are more fully revealed and are discussed in relation to strategies employed by other purple bacteria.;  Figure 4 compares the amino acid sequences of the LH1 α- or β-polypeptides from several purple bacteria including Hlr. halochloris and Hlr. abdelmalekii.; A second factor that may affect salt- and pH-dependent spectral changes in Hlr. halochloris LH1-RCs is LH1 α-Cys+3 [25]. Such a residue is rarely present near an α-BChl b-binding His0 and is replaced with Leu or Val in most purple bacteria other than Roseospirillum parvum [33,34]. Based on the pKa values of the Cys side chain (ranging from 2.9 to 9.8 inside proteins) [35] and its close association with LH1 BChl molecules [36], we proposed the side chain thiol/thiolate of α-Cys+3 as a candidate for modulating the point-charge around molecules of BChl b that trigger the pH-dependent interconvertible LH1 Qy band shifts of Hlr. halochloris [25]. The present study demonstrated that the Hlr. abdelmalekii LH1-RCs exhibited salt- and pH-dependent interconvertible spectral changes as well (Figure 1).;  Therefore, we focused our analyses on the amino acid composition of LH1 polypeptides (Figure 4) and the RC C-subunits (Figure S3) from various purple bacteria.;  It has been observed that halophilic proteins contain increased levels of negative charges due to the presence of acidic amino acids on their surfaces [38,44,45,46,47]. In agreement with this, the contents of acidic residues in both Hlr. halochloris and Hlr. abdelmalekii LH1 α- and β-polypeptides are significantly greater than those in non-halophilic purple bacteria, and the excess acidic residues are predominantly present in their C-terminal regions (Figure 4).;  In addition to LH1 polypeptides, the C-subunits of Halorhodospira RCs also exhibit high contents of acidic residues compared with those of nonhalophilic purple bacteria (Figure S3)."
purple non-sulfur bacteria,1224,26941731,4766312," Within these taxa, amplicon sequences related to Halorubrum, Natrinema, Gracilimonas, purple non-sulfur bacteria (Rhizobiales, Rhodobacter, and Rhodobaca) and chemolithotrophic sulfur oxidizers (Thioalkalivibrio) were highly abundant.;  Haloalkaliphilic members of the purple non-sulfur bacteria belonging to the latter two genera are frequently detected in soda lakes (Rees et al., 2004; Kompantseva et al., 2007; Asao et al., 2011).;  Although there is a high probability that the Rhizobiales-related sequences in this study are from terrestrial origin, the order includes, besides plant rhizobia, plant- and animal-pathogens, photosynthetic purple non-sulfur bacteria that occur in soda lakes, such as the genera Rhodopseudomonas, Rhodoblastus, and Rhodomicrobium (Tourova et al., 2011).;  In the datasets of the more moderate saline brines of PL and T5, a substantial fraction of the alphaproteobacterial OTUs affiliated with the Rhodospirillaceae, another phylogenetic group of purple non-sulfur bacteria (Imhoff, 1995), still without soda lake isolates."
